====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers postcolonial and decolonial critiques of the assumption, embedded in
Habermas's communicative rationality and theory of modernity, that the normative resources
for emancipation can be drawn from the developmental logic of Western modernity itself.
Two analytically distinct but overlapping traditions bear on the project. Postcolonial
theory (Said, Spivak, Bhabha, Chakrabarty) -- rooted in poststructuralist readings of
colonial discourse -- charges that Eurocentric knowledge formations render non-Western
subjects unrepresentable or subaltern within dominant epistemic frameworks. Decolonial
philosophy (Quijano, Mignolo, Wynter, Maldonado-Torres) -- emerging from Latin American
and Caribbean intellectual traditions -- argues that modernity and coloniality are
co-constitutive: Western modernity did not simply exclude the colonial periphery but was
structurally constituted through it, such that colonial power/knowledge relations are the
necessary underside of the very Enlightenment that Habermas seeks to rehabilitate.

Habermas's "Philosophical Discourse of Modernity" (1987) is the central target: critics
charge that its genealogy of modernity remains strictly intra-European, ignoring how
colonial conquest, slave trade, and epistemological violence were structurally intertwined
with the very rationalization processes Habermas reconstructs. Quijano's concept of the
"coloniality of power" and Wynter's critique of the overrepresentation of European Man
as the universal subject of knowledge provide the sharpest decolonial tools for this
critique. Amy Allen's "The End of Progress" (2016) is the most systematic engagement
from within critical theory itself, arguing that the Frankfurt School's Eurocentrism is
not an oversight but a structural feature of its progressivist normative framework.
Bailey's edited volume "Deprovincializing Habermas" (2014) collects both critical and
reconstructive responses from non-Western perspectives.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the broader landscape into which Dussel's transmodern critique
(Domain 4) fits: Dussel engages Habermas explicitly but draws on the same decolonial
vocabulary as Mignolo and Quijano. Understanding the postcolonial/decolonial landscape
clarifies what is distinctive about Dussel's transmodern alternative and allows the
review to situate his critique at the intersection of liberation philosophy and
decolonial thought. The domain also illuminates why "exclusion" in communicative action
is not merely a matter of practical access (e.g., women being kept out of the public
sphere) but potentially a structural-epistemic feature of Habermasian rationality itself.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Specific engagements with Habermas by Homi Bhabha or Edward Said directly (rather than
through secondary reception) are sparse in academic databases; the Spivak "Can the
Subaltern Speak?" article is indexed under Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture
but no DOI is available for the original 1988 essay. The Bhambra (2007) book on
rethinking modernity is found through CrossRef but the book itself lacks a standalone
DOI entry. Three entries are marked INCOMPLETE (Wynter 2003, Mignolo 2000, Chakrabarty
2000) due to unavailable abstracts for paywalled books/articles; these entries remain
in the file but should not be treated as synthesizable without additional access.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis writer should foreground the postcolonial/decolonial distinction: postcolonialism
critiques Eurocentric representation and discourse; decolonialism argues modernity/coloniality
are structurally co-constitutive, requiring not reform of Habermasian universalism but a
break from its normative framework. Amy Allen's work is the pivot point, arguing from
within Frankfurt School critical theory itself for decolonization of its progressivist
assumptions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Decolonial critique (Mignolo, Quijano, Wynter, Maldonado-Torres): 5 papers -- coloniality is the dark side of modernity; epistemic delinking required
- Frankfurt School self-critique (Allen, McCarthy, Torres): 4 papers -- Habermas's Eurocentrism is structural, not incidental
- Postcolonial historical critique (Chakrabarty, Gunaratne, Castro-Gomez): 3 papers -- European modernity only intelligible through its colonial entanglements
- Productive reconstruction (Bailey, Consani, Kempf, Danner): 3 papers -- potential dialogues between Habermas and decolonial thought

  title = {Coloniality of Power and Eurocentrism in Latin America},
  journal = {International Sociology},
  year = {2000},

  pages = {215--232},
  doi = {10.1177/0268580900015002005},
  abstract = {The globalization of the world is, in the first place, the culmination of a process that began with the constitution of America and world capitalism as a Euro-centered colonial/modern world power. One of the foundations of that pattern of power was the social classification of the world population upon the base of the idea of race, a mental construct that expresses colonial experience and that pervades the most important dimensions of world power, including its specific rationality: Eurocentrism. This article discusses some implications of that coloniality of power in Latin American history.},
  abstract_source = {openalex},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Quijano argues that the colonial imposition of racial classification on global populations constituted a new pattern of world power -- the "coloniality of power" -- that did not end with formal decolonization and continues to structure global hierarchies of knowledge, labour, and subjectivity. Race, as a social category, is intrinsic to modernity, not external to it; Europe consolidated its self-image as rational and modern precisely by casting colonized peoples as its inferior other.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the foundational decolonial concept -- coloniality of power -- that underpins critique of Habermasian theory: if modernity and coloniality are structurally co-constituted, then Habermas's reconstruction of modernity's emancipatory potential as immanent to Western rationalization is, from the start, built on a foundation it cannot acknowledge without self-undermining. The concept directly informs how Dussel, Mignolo, and Allen challenge Habermas.

  POSITION: Foundational decolonial argument that modernity and coloniality are inseparable co-constitutive formations.

  journal = {CR: The New Centennial Review},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {3},
  number = {3},
  pages = {257--337},
  doi = {10.1353/ncr.2004.0015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wynter argues that Western modernity installed "Man" (the Enlightenment bourgeois subject) as the overrepresented conception of the human, displacing the theological "Christian" with the secular "rational Man" and consigning racialized others -- Native, Black, colonized populations -- to a zone of sub-humanity. Emancipation requires not simply including these others within the existing humanist framework but overthrowing the epistemic grid that makes "Man" the measure of all humanity.

  RELEVANCE: Wynter's argument exposes a structural problem for Habermasian communicative rationality: if the very notion of communicative competence and rational agency is premised on an overrepresentation of Western Man as the norm of the human, then the ideal speech situation cannot simply be extended to include the colonized -- the framework itself requires replacement. This provides the decolonial ground for critiquing discourse ethics as inherently exclusive.

  POSITION: Decolonial humanist critique that moves beyond postcolonial representation to question the epistemic foundations of Western humanism itself.

  pages = {240--270},
  doi = {10.1080/09502380601162548},
  abstract = {The concept of coloniality of Being emerged in discussions of a diverse group of scholars doing work on coloniality and decolonization. More particularly, we owe the idea to Walter D. Mignolo, who first proposed thinking about a coloniality of Being to complement his analysis of the coloniality of power and the coloniality of knowledge.},
  abstract_source = {openalex},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Fanon and Dussel, Maldonado-Torres develops the concept of the "coloniality of being" to describe how colonial conquest introduced a systematic devaluation of the being and humanity of colonized peoples -- a damno (damnation) that operates at the ontological level below the epistemological. Colonial modernity is constituted by a permanent "war" against the colonized that is rendered invisible by liberal political philosophy's claim to universal human dignity.

  RELEVANCE: The coloniality of being concept directly challenges Habermas's presupposition that communicative action operates within a shared lifeworld: where coloniality structures who counts as a full speaker and whose suffering counts as a legitimate validity claim, the conditions for symmetrical discourse are not merely difficult to achieve but ontologically foreclosed. Connects Wynter's epistemic critique to Fanon's phenomenology.

  POSITION: Decolonial ontological argument extending Quijano's coloniality of power to the level of lived existence and subjectivity.

@book{allen2016end,
  author = {Allen, Amy},
  title = {The End of Progress: Decolonizing the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory},
  year = {2016},
  publisher = {Columbia University Press},
  doi = {10.7312/alle17324},
  abstract = {Allen identifies two main goals: to critique Habermas and successors (Honneth, Forst) as wedded to problematically Eurocentric and foundationalist strategies for grounding normativity, including implicitly colonialist notions of intellectual and social progress; and to decolonize Frankfurt School critical theory by offering alternative bases for normativity informed by decolonial theory, critical race theory, and queer theory. Her argumentative strategy sets up a trilemma between relativism, progressivist foundationalism, and rationalist foundationalism, arguing that Habermas and Honneth fall into progressivism by reconstructing norms from the implicit trajectory of Western social history, thereby relying on a morally and factually suspect idea of progress entangled with the legacies of racism, colonialism, and imperialism.},
  abstract_source = {ndpr},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen argues that the Frankfurt School -- including Habermas -- relies on a Hegelian-Kantian philosophy of history in which Western modernity represents "progress" over non-Western forms of life. This progressivism is not incidental but structural: Habermas's post-conventional morality, discourse ethics, and account of rational learning all presuppose a developmental hierarchy that relegates non-Western lifeworlds to earlier stages. Allen calls for a "decolonizing" of critical theory that abandons this progressivist framework while retaining the project of immanent critique.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most systematic Frankfurt School internal critique of Habermasian Eurocentrism and is essential to the domain. Allen engages directly with postcolonial and decolonial thinkers (Spivak, Mignolo, Quijano) and with the Frankfurt tradition (Adorno, Horkheimer, Habermas) to show how the "motivated silence" on colonialism is structural, not merely an oversight. The book establishes the theoretical stakes for how Dussel's transmodern critique can be read as a decolonizing move.

  POSITION: Internal Frankfurt School critique calling for decolonization of critical theory's progressivist normative architecture.

@book{mignolo2000local,
  author = {Mignolo, Walter D.},
  title = {Local Histories/Global Designs: Coloniality, Subaltern Knowledges, and Border Thinking},
  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mignolo argues that Western universalism -- including Habermas's discourse ethics and Apel's transcendental pragmatics -- operates as a "local history" that has universalized itself into a global design, erasing its own geopolitical locus of enunciation. Against this, Mignolo proposes "border thinking" (pensamiento fronterizo), a form of reasoning from the colonial difference that does not seek inclusion in Western modernity but rather de-links from its epistemic hegemony, drawing on suppressed subaltern knowledges.

  RELEVANCE: Mignolo's critique directly targets the kind of universalism Habermas claims for discourse ethics: the argument is not that the ideal speech situation is practically inaccessible but that its philosophical grounding enacts the very colonial gesture of treating a particular epistemic standpoint as universal. Mignolo's notion of "delinking" provides the decolonial alternative to Habermasian reformism that Dussel echoes through the concept of transmodernity.

  POSITION: Decolonial epistemological argument for border thinking against Western epistemic universalism.

@book{chakrabarty2000provincializing,
  author = {Chakrabarty, Dipesh},
  title = {Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference},
  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chakrabarty argues that European thought -- including the post-Hegelian social theory that underpins Habermas's reconstruction of modernity -- is simultaneously indispensable and inadequate for understanding the non-Western world. European concepts like democracy, citizenship, and communicative reason carry a "hyperreal" status that renders other histories provincial. The project of "provincializing Europe" does not reject European thought but works on its historicity and provinciality from within.

  RELEVANCE: Chakrabarty's argument provides the postcolonial hermeneutic complement to the decolonial tradition: where Mignolo calls for delinking, Chakrabarty works within the tension between European universals and non-European particular histories. This maps onto the debate about whether Habermas's theory can be reconstructed from global perspectives (Bailey) or whether its universalism is irreparably Eurocentric (Allen, Mignolo).

  POSITION: Postcolonial critique of European universals that provincializes rather than rejects them, creating productive tension with decolonial calls for full epistemic delinking.

  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511814044},
  abstract = {In an exciting study of ideas accompanying the rise of the West, Thomas McCarthy analyzes the ideologies of race and empire that were integral to European-American expansion. He highlights the central role that conceptions of human development (civilization, progress, modernization, and the like) played in answering challenges to legitimacy through a hierarchical ordering of difference. Focusing on Kant and natural history in the eighteenth century, Mill and social Darwinism in the nineteenth, and theories of development and modernization in the twentieth, he proposes a critical theory of development which can counter contemporary neoracism and neoimperialism, and can accommodate the multiple modernities now taking shape. Offering an unusual perspective on the past and present of our globalizing world, this book will appeal to scholars and advanced students of philosophy, political theory, the history of ideas, racial and ethnic studies, social theory, and cultural studies.},
  abstract_source = {openalex},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarthy -- a leading commentator on Habermas -- argues that Western liberal and critical theory has been systematically disfigured by its entanglement with racial ideology and empire. The book traces how Kant's racial hierarchy, nineteenth-century social Darwinism, and liberal imperialism have shaped the developmental schemas that persist in twentieth-century critical theory, including Habermas's account of moral learning. McCarthy calls for a critical reckoning with this legacy within the Frankfurt School tradition.

  RELEVANCE: McCarthy's book represents a significant internal critique from within Habermasian scholarship: it takes the developmental hierarchy that Allen later analyses as "progressivism" and shows its concrete historical form in racial ideology and imperial practice. This book bridges postcolonial scholarship and the immanent critique of Habermasian theory, making it directly relevant to understanding how exclusions are structured into the theory of communicative rationality.

  POSITION: Internal Habermasian critique exposing the entanglement of critical theory's developmental schemas with racial ideology and imperial history.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume brings together Habermas scholars and critics from non-Western contexts to interrogate and reconstruct Habermas's political theory. Contributors examine whether Habermasian theory can be applied to non-Western contexts (Latin America, Africa, South Asia, China) and whether it can survive postcolonial and decolonial challenges to its universalist pretensions, including a chapter specifically defending Habermas against Mignolo's decolonial challenge.

  RELEVANCE: "Deprovincializing Habermas" is a key reference for the productive-engagement position: it represents the attempt to retain Habermasian theory while responding to its critics, including a chapter (Morrow) specifically on the debate with Mignolo. The volume's structure maps the spectrum of positions from external critique to internal reconstruction, making it essential for understanding where Dussel's engagement fits in the broader landscape.

  POSITION: Pluralist reconstruction that tests Habermasian theory across global contexts while acknowledging the force of postcolonial and decolonial challenges.

@book{habermas1987philosophical,
  author = {Habermas, J{\"u}rgen},
  title = {The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures},
  year = {1987},
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Habermas reconstructs the philosophical discourse of modernity from Hegel through Nietzsche, Adorno, and Foucault, defending the "unfinished project of modernity" against postmodern critique. He argues that communicative rationality provides the normative resources for a critique of instrumental reason without abandoning the Enlightenment's emancipatory aspirations. The account of modernity is resolutely internal to Western European intellectual history.

  RELEVANCE: This book is the primary target for postcolonial and decolonial critics of Habermasian modernity: its genealogy of modernity begins with Hegel and proceeds through German idealism and French poststructuralism, with no engagement with colonialism, slave trade, or non-European modernity. The "motivated silence" Allen identifies is most visible here. Dussel's transmodern critique specifically responds to this text, arguing that Habermas's account of modernity is a "myth" that excludes 1492 and the conquest.

  POSITION: Habermas's own account of modernity as an intra-European philosophical discourse, making it the central target for postcolonial and decolonial critique.

  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9780429027239-11},
  abstract = {During the last two decades of the twentieth century, postmodern philosophy and cultural studies developed into important theoretical currents that impelled a strong critique, inside and outside the academy, of the pathologies of Westernization. Their many differences notwithstanding, both currents attribute these pathologies to the exclusive, dualist character that modern power relations assume. Modernity is an alterity-generating machine that, in the name of reason and humanism, excludes from its imaginary the hybridity, multiplicity, ambiguity, and contingency of different forms of life. The current crisis of modernity is seen by postmodern philosophy and cultural studies as a historic opportunity for these long-repressed differences to emerge. I argue that the present global reorganization of the capitalist economy depends on the production of differences, and that the challenge now facing a critical theory of society is to reveal how the epistemic violence of the social sciences contributed to this system through the construction of the colonial Other.},
  abstract_source = {s2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Castro-Gomez argues that Habermas's "project of modernity" cannot be disentangled from the formation of nation-states and colonial power. The social sciences that emerged to administer modern states practiced "epistemic violence" by constructing the non-Western "Other" as an object of knowledge to be governed and civilized, not as a speaking subject in a communicative community. The coloniality of power, as developed by Quijano, broadens Foucault's concept of disciplinary power by situating it within global colonial structures.

  RELEVANCE: Castro-Gomez provides a direct critique of Habermas's "project of modernity" that shows how the emergence of the social sciences -- a key element of Habermas's account of societal rationalization -- was structurally linked to colonial administration and epistemic violence. This connects the Frankfurt School's critique of instrumental rationality to the decolonial critique of colonial reason.

  POSITION: Latin American decolonial critique showing the co-constitution of social-scientific knowledge and colonial power within Habermas's "project of modernity."

  pages = {93--156},
  doi = {10.1177/152263790600800201},
  abstract = {Habermas's critical theory of society and modernity, which he developed by reconstructing the concepts of public sphere/civil society and rationality, suffers from some of the same weaknesses attributed to the structural-functionalist modernization theory. Both theories lean solely on European historical experience despite their proponents' claim for "universalism." The theory of communicative action, wherein Habermas has now implanted the public sphere, is the product of merging philosophy of history (or historical hermeneutics) and empirical social science. This monograph calls for a revision or "glocalization" of Habermas's theory to remove its lingering traces of "universalism" that promote domination through globalization -- a euphemism for Eurocentric hegemony. The aporetic presumptions of Habermasian theory do not necessarily match the ontological, epistemological, and historical reservoir of the non-West. Therefore, the project of provincializing "Europe" is in order.},
  abstract_source = {openalex},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gunaratne interrogates Habermas's public sphere theory from the perspective of Asian and non-Western communicative traditions. The argument is that the bourgeois public sphere is a culturally specific Western formation that cannot serve as a universal model: non-Western societies have their own historical forms of public reason and deliberation that Habermas's Eurocentric framework cannot recognize. The paper surveys Buddhist, Confucian, and Islamic intellectual traditions to argue for an alternative, pluriversal conception of public communication.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the central question of whether Habermas's communicative rationality and public sphere are inherently Eurocentric by examining how they exclude non-Western modes of public reason. It provides empirical-comparative grounding for the theoretical critique, showing specific traditions that fall outside Habermas's framework while sharing normative commitments to reasoned public discourse.

  POSITION: Cross-cultural critique of Habermas's public sphere as culturally parochial, arguing for pluriversal conceptions of communicative reason.

  abstract = {This essay by Nelson Maldonado-Torres examines the conjunction of race and space in the work of several European thinkers. It focuses on Martin Heidegger's project of searching for roots in the West. This project of searching for roots is unmasked as being complicit with an imperial cartographical vision that creates and divides the cities of the gods and the cities of the damned. Maldonado-Torres identifies similar conceptions in other Western thinkers, most notably Levinas, Negri, Zizeck, Habermas, and Derrida. To the project of searching for roots and its racist undertones, he opposes a Fanonian critical vision that highlights the constitutive character of coloniality and damnation for the project of European modernity. He concludes with a call for radical diversality and a decolonial geopolitics of knowledge.},
  abstract_source = {openalex},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Maldonado-Torres traces the connections between Heidegger's topology of being, Levinas's ethics of alterity, and Fanon's phenomenology of colonial racism to articulate the "geopolitics of knowledge": the claim that knowledge is always produced from a geopolitical locus that colonial modernity has rendered invisible. The paper argues that Habermas's postmetaphysical thinking remains blind to its own geopolitical situatedness.

  RELEVANCE: This earlier paper provides the philosophical groundwork for Maldonado-Torres's "On the Coloniality of Being" (2007) and is more directly focused on the epistemological presuppositions of Western philosophy, including Habermasian communicative theory. The geopolitics of knowledge concept exposes the hidden locus of enunciation in Habermasian universalism.

  pages = {222--252},
  doi = {10.15210/dissertatio.v47i0.9644},
  abstract = {The paper argues for Latin-American philosophy as a decolonial praxis which unveils and overcomes the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity (such as Max Weber and Jurgen Habermas). This historical-sociological blindness is characterized by the separation between European culture and the modern Realpolitik of colonialism as non-dependent and non-mutually-supported moments, and by the reconstruction of the process of constitution of European modernity as an endogenous, self-referential and basically internal movement of evolution, ignoring its correlation and profound linking with colonialism. The paper argues that the critical and emancipatory role of the modernity's normative paradigm is only possible through that historical-sociological blindness. Latin-American philosophy, the moment it denounces and unveils the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity, points directly to the self-restraint of the modernity's normative paradigm as the basic theoretical-political agenda and praxis for a decolonial philosophy, as condition also to the correction of modernity itself.},
  abstract_source = {s2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Danner argues that both Weberian and Habermasian theories of modernity suffer from a "historical-sociological blindness": they reconstruct the emergence of Western rationalization as an endogenous, self-referential process, systematically ignoring the constitutive role of colonialism. Against Habermas's defense of modernity's normative paradigm as non-fundamentalist universalism, Danner argues from a Latin American decolonial perspective that only a "self-restraint" of modernity's normative claims, coupled with reparation for colonialism, can provide a viable critical-normative framework.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides a Latin American philosophical perspective on Habermas's historical blindness, connecting the decolonial critique to the philosophy of liberation tradition (relevant to understanding Dussel's context). It specifically takes on Habermas's defense of modernity's normative paradigm and shows why it cannot accommodate the colonial constitution of modernity.

  abstract = {From a decolonial perspective, Habermas' theory is seen by many as Eurocentric and in philosophical alliance with colonial rule. In particular, his theory of progress is seen as offensive because it devalues non-Western ways of understanding in comparison to their modern Western counterparts. On the one hand, this is true. On the other hand, Habermas' actual concept of progress can also be used to formulate a critique of colonialist development imperatives. Moreover, his concept of "systematically distorted communication" can make an interesting contribution to understanding colonial rule: even colonial rule is communicatively mediated, with the constant risk of dissent precariously held in check by racist discourse barriers. Fanon already provides strong starting points for this communication-theoretical view of colonial rule. With him, the decolonial struggles against racist discourse barriers also come into view.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kempf examines the relationship between Habermas and Fanon on colonial domination, acknowledging from a decolonial perspective that Habermas's theory is Eurocentric and philosophically aligned with colonial rule through its theory of progress. However, Kempf argues that Habermas's concept of "systematically distorted communication" can be productively applied to understand colonial rule as communicatively mediated: even colonial domination involves communicative relations in which racist discourse barriers hold dissent precariously in check.

  RELEVANCE: This article represents the most recent philosophical engagement between Habermasian theory and decolonial critique, examining whether Fanon and Habermas can be productively read together. It provides a nuanced position that acknowledges Habermas's Eurocentrism while exploring whether elements of communicative theory can illuminate colonial structures -- directly relevant to evaluating whether Habermasian categories can survive decolonial critique.

  POSITION: Critical but partially reconstructive engagement: acknowledges Habermasian Eurocentrism while exploring the concept of systematically distorted communication as a tool for analyzing colonial domination.

  abstract = {This paper deals with Amy Allen's critique of Habermas's theory of modernity, democracy, and cosmopolitanism. I will focus on her arguments that touch on the role of rationality. Allen's critique of Habermas will be presented, especially where she argues that focusing on rationality is ethnocentric and promotes the political exclusion of subaltern groups. The extent to which Allen's critiques affect the emancipatory potential of Habermasian theory will next be assessed. It is finally argued that Allen's position leads to a denial of the distinction between social rationality and irrationality as legitimate criteria. The consequences of such a position for the political sphere will then be analyzed.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Consani examines Amy Allen's decolonial critique of Habermas's theory of modernity, democracy, and cosmopolitanism, focusing on the claim that rationality-based frameworks are ethnocentric and promote political exclusion of subaltern groups. Consani argues that while Allen's postcolonial-inflected critique raises important challenges to Habermasian universalism, her position ultimately denies the distinction between social rationality and irrationality in a way that undermines the emancipatory potential of critical theory and forecloses legitimate normative critique of power.

  RELEVANCE: Consani's article represents the defense of Habermasian theory against Allen's decolonial critique, arguing that the critical theory tradition can retain its emancipatory potential even after taking postcolonial challenges seriously. This reconstructive response is important for situating the debate: it shows what is at stake in abandoning versus retaining rationality-based critique, and opens the question of whether Dussel's transmodern alternative provides a more viable path.

  POSITION: Partial defense of Habermasian rationalism against Allen's decolonial critique, arguing that the decolonial turn risks eliminating the normative foundation for any critical theory.

  abstract = {This article examines the shift in direction of the Frankfurt School following Stephan Lessenich's appointment as director of the Institute for Social Research (IfS) in 2021. A key innovation introduced by the current research program at the IfS is a substantive critique of the Eurocentrism embedded in the Frankfurt tradition. The heterodox impulse championed by Lessenich can be situated within the broader evolution of the critique of Eurocentrism in Western social sciences. This evolution comprises three phases: emergence, expansion, and ascent to prominence in academia in the Global North. The article explores the underlying causes of significant resistance to moving away from a Eurocentric framework and proposes that Lessenich's intellectual leadership is guiding the Frankfurt School toward a paradigm shift, which is taking shape through the development of a new vision of society that incorporates the intellectual traditions and historical realities of the Global South.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Torres examines the shift in the Frankfurt School's self-understanding following Stephan Lessenich's 2021 appointment as director of the Institut fuer Sozialforschung. The article analyzes three phases in which the critique of Eurocentrism has developed in Western social sciences and argues that the new research program at IfS is guiding the Frankfurt School toward a paradigm shift that incorporates intellectual traditions from the Global South, moving beyond the Eurocentric framework embedded in the Frankfurt tradition including Habermas.

  RELEVANCE: This 2025 paper captures the most recent institutional developments in the Frankfurt School's own response to postcolonial and decolonial critique, showing that the critique of Habermasian Eurocentrism is now internal to the institution itself. It provides important context for the current state of the debate and suggests that even the heirs of the Frankfurt School recognize the structural Eurocentrism Allen and others have identified.

  POSITION: Recent institutional critique from within the Frankfurt School tradition, documenting the shift away from Habermasian Eurocentrism toward postcolonial world society.

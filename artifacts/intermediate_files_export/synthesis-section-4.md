## Section 3: The Decolonial Challenge — From Procedural Exclusion to Colonial Reason

The structural diagnosis that emerged across feminist, race, disability, and multi-axis critiques — that Habermasian universalism encodes the capacities of a normatively particular subject — finds its most philosophically radical elaboration in postcolonial and decolonial thought. Where feminist and race critiques argue that the framework misrecognizes or disadvantages those who inhabit it differently, the decolonial tradition advances a more fundamental charge: that the normative resources of communicative rationality and modernity cannot be used to critique the colonial conditions of their own production, because modernity and coloniality are not contingent companions but constitutive co-formations. This move transforms the critique from a problem of procedural design to a problem of philosophical foundation.

### Subsection 3.1: Modernity/Coloniality and the Frankfurt School's Structural Blindspot

The decolonial critique begins with a historical-philosophical claim about the relationship between modernity and coloniality. Quijano's (2000) foundational argument is that colonial conquest from 1492 onward introduced race as a mental construct intrinsic to modernity itself: the classification of global populations by racial categories was not an external imposition on a pre-formed Enlightenment project but the mechanism through which European self-understanding as rational, modern, and universal was constituted, by contrast with colonized peoples cast as its inferior other. If this co-constitution is structural rather than incidental, then Habermas's reconstruction of modernity's emancipatory potential — in both *The Theory of Communicative Action* and *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* — is built on a foundation whose colonial underside it cannot acknowledge without self-undermining. The "unfinished project of modernity" appears coherent only from within its own Eurocentric horizon.

Allen's (2016) book-length argument extends this charge to the Frankfurt School tradition as a whole. Her diagnosis is precise: Habermas does not simply ignore colonialism as a topic but relies on a Hegelian-Kantian philosophy of history in which Western modernity represents developmental "progress" over non-Western forms of life. This progressivism — evident in the account of post-conventional morality, the sequence from conventional to reflective communicative competence, and the theory of rational learning — is not an accidental residue but a structural feature of the normative architecture. The framework requires a developmental hierarchy to do the work of grounding normative critique, and that hierarchy encodes the colonial relegation of non-Western lifeworlds to earlier stages of a single developmental trajectory. McCarthy (2009), writing as an interlocutor rather than an antagonist of the Frankfurt School, pursues the same diagnosis historically: the developmentalist schemas embedded in critical theory were not simply shared by, but positively shaped by, the racial ideology and imperial practice of nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century European thought. The entanglement is not peripheral to the intellectual tradition; it runs through its core categories.

Maldonado-Torres (2007) extends the critique to the ontological level with the concept of the "coloniality of being": colonial conquest introduced a systematic devaluation of the being and humanity of colonized peoples that operates below the epistemological and cannot be remedied by epistemological reform. Colonial modernity constituted the colonized not merely as epistemically marginalized but as existentially subordinated — a "damnation" that forecloses the conditions for symmetrical discourse before any deliberative exchange can take place. This connects Fanon's phenomenological account of the racialized body to the broader decolonial framework and directly challenges Habermas's presupposition that communicative competence is universally available: where the coloniality of being has systematically devalued the being of colonized peoples, the preconditions of free communicative participation are not waiting to be activated by procedural reform but have been ontologically foreclosed. Castro-Gómez (2019) shows how this operates through the social sciences that constitute Habermas's "project of modernity": the disciplinary knowledge-formations that accompanied modern state administration practiced what he calls "epistemic violence," constructing the non-Western other as an object of governance and civilizational rescue rather than as a communicative subject capable of validity claims. The sciences of modernity were simultaneously sciences of colonial management.

Bhambra (2021) presses beyond Allen and McCarthy to argue that this contamination cannot be resolved by internal reconstruction. Where Allen and McCarthy propose decolonizing critical theory from within its own tradition — retaining immanent critique while abandoning the progressivist teleology — Bhambra argues that the categories of Frankfurt School critical theory are themselves constituted through colonial exclusions in ways that cannot be corrected by acknowledging colonial histories and moving on. "Epistemological justice" requires not acknowledgment but a transformation of the standpoint from which critique is launched. This internal-versus-external debate structures the reconstructive options that Section 4 assesses. Torres (2025) documents that the Frankfurt School itself has now begun an institutional reckoning with this critique, with the Institut für Sozialforschung under Stephan Lessenich developing a research program that explicitly confronts the Eurocentrism embedded in the Frankfurt tradition — a development that signals the critique's penetration to the center of the tradition it targets.

### Subsection 3.2: Dussel's Transmodern Critique — The Victim's Claim from Exteriority

Enrique Dussel's transmodern critique is continuous with this landscape but constitutes a philosophically distinct intervention that resists assimilation to either the postcolonial or the decolonial traditions as typically represented. Three analytically separable components of his argument bear on the project of situating him in relation to Habermas.

The first is a direct engagement with discourse ethics. Habermas never directly engaged Dussel, but the interlocutor Dussel does engage is Apel, whose discourse ethics shares with Habermas's the core commitment to validity through ideal consensus — the "unforced force of the better argument." Dussel's critique of Apel is therefore, in its philosophical structure, a critique of the Habermasian foundations. In "The Architectonic of the Ethics of Liberation" (Dussel 1997), Dussel presents the formal-moral principle of discourse ethics — validity through participation in an ideal communication community — not as false but as derivative. In his architectonic, the formal principle occupies the second position, preceded by the material principle: the reproduction of human life as the foundational content of moral obligation. The argument is not that ideal consensus is unimportant but that it already presupposes what it cannot deliver: participation in the communication community. Victims of the global system — the colonized, the poor, the structurally excluded — are, by their structural position, outside this community. The "unforced force of the better argument" is available only to those already inside; it cannot be invoked by those for whom being inside is precisely what the world-system has denied. In *Ethics of Liberation* (Dussel 2013), this architectonic is elaborated into a six-principle system in which the living, suffering body of the victim is the ethical starting point, and the anti-hegemonic community of victims constitutes the site of critical validity — a reformulation of the Apelian communication community from the standpoint of exteriority rather than inclusion.

The second component is Dussel's contestation of the "unfinished project of modernity." Habermas's defense of modernity against postmodern critique — in *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* — diagnoses modernity as incomplete rather than exhausted: its emancipatory principles, including communicative rationality and public reason, have not yet been fully realized, and the task of critical theory is their completion rather than their abandonment. For Dussel, this diagnosis is coherent only from within Eurocentrism (Dussel 2012). If modernity is dated from the Enlightenment and the bourgeois revolutions, its emancipatory principles appear as genuine resources that colonial domination has failed to universalize. But if modernity is dated from 1492 — from the colonial conquest that constituted European self-understanding as rational and modern — then the emancipatory principles were never separable from colonial exclusion; they were produced through it. "Transmodernity" is Dussel's response: not anti-modernity, not the postmodern critique of Western reason from within its own tradition, but a genuinely pluriversal project that proposes the mutual enrichment of Western and non-Western intellectual traditions from positions of exteriority — "enrichment" rather than "inclusion" because inclusion would mean absorption into a universal that remains Eurocentric (Dussel 2011). As Danner (2018) shows, this positions Dussel against Habermas's defense of the normative paradigm of modernity as recoverable: Habermas's "historical-sociological blindness" reconstructs European modernity as an endogenous, self-referential development, and this blindness is not correctable from within the framework because the framework requires it.

The third and philosophically most distinctive component is the analeptic method and the concept of the victim as ethical starting point. Dussel draws on Levinas's ethics of alterity but transforms it: where Levinas's Other is the phenomenological other encountered in face-to-face relation, Dussel's Other is the excluded victim of the modern world-system — the colonized, the global poor — whose claim arises not from the intimacy of ethical encounter but from the structured exteriority of colonial exclusion (Maldonado-Torres 2011). The "trans-ontological" or "analeptic" claim is that the victim issues a demand from exteriority to the dominant totality — a demand that cannot be heard within the framework of the totality precisely because the framework itself has constituted the victim as non-participant. This is not a claim for recognition within the existing communicative order, not even the formation of a counter-public. Counter-publics, as Fraser conceived them, remain within the logic of the public sphere: they are arenas where subaltern groups reformulate needs and identities before (re)entering dominant publics. The victim's analeptic claim challenges the ontological framework that generates the public and its counter-publics alike (Allen and Mendieta 2021).

What distinguishes Dussel from other critics in this landscape is clarified by comparison. Unlike Fraser, Dussel does not propose a counter-public within the existing deliberative framework: the victim's claim does not demand inclusion in the communication community but challenges the community's ontological boundary. Unlike Bhambra, whose critique is primarily epistemological — requiring a transformation of the standpoint from which we theorize — Dussel's critique is ethical-material: it is grounded in the living, suffering body of the victim, not in epistemic standpoints or analytical vantage points. Unlike Mignolo's (2000) "border thinking," which proposes epistemic delinking from Eurocentric universalism, Dussel retains the formal principle of discourse ethics as the second principle in his architectonic: he does not reject universalism but insists that material content — the reproduction of human life — must precede and condition formal procedure. And unlike Allen's (2016) postfoundationalist alternative, which draws on Adorno's negative dialectics and Foucault's genealogy to critique the progressivist teleology without replacing it, Dussel proposes a positive material principle grounded in the living body as the foundation that a decolonized ethics requires (Almeida 2019; Grosfoguel 2011).

The victim's analeptic claim thus occupies a philosophically distinctive position: it shares the feminist and race critiques' structural diagnosis of Habermasian exclusion — that the communication community is constituted through the exclusion it cannot register — but operates at the foundational level of the framework's self-understanding. It is not a complaint about who is procedurally disadvantaged within the discourse but a challenge to the very ontological framework that determines who is inside and outside it. This distinction is what Section 4's assessment of Habermasian defenses and sympathetic reconstructions must confront: responses that address procedural or even structural exclusion leave the analeptic claim untouched, because the victim's exteriority is not a problem of access or procedural design but of the framework's constitutive limits.

Whether that challenge can be absorbed within an expanded Habermasian framework or requires its foundational revision is the question to which Section 4 turns.

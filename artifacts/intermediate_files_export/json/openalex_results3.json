      "abstract": "Habermas's new book, A New Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,1 offers a timely and insightful analysis of the threats that online communication poses to the maintenance of an inclusive public sphere in democratic societies. Amid growing discontent with democracy, there are plenty of reasons to be worried about the increasing deterioration of the political public sphere. In addition to long-standing threats such as the excessive influence of money in political discourse, the potential for manipulation by powerful social groups, and the exclusion of marginalized voices from public discourse, technological innovations such as social media platforms and big data collection are generating new types of threats. These threats are being generated more quickly than society's ability to cope with them. The business model of social media platforms is based on maximizing user engagement through data harvesting and algorithmic personalization. The preselection of content for users based on data about their past preferences facilitates the creation of filter bubbles and echo chambers with the consequence that those who rely mainly on social media almost never receive information, news, or opinions that they do not already agree with. These features of social media not only increase group isolation, fragmentation, and polarization but also facilitate the dissemination of misinformation, fake news, conspiracy theories, and the micro-targeted manipulation of voters. Amid these threatening developments, we are seeing a decline in traditional media outlets that operate under journalistic norms of impartiality, accuracy, accountability, and so on. Consequently, it is unclear how citizens can stay sufficiently politically informed to engage in meaningful debate with their fellow citizens, even on the most fundamental political problems facing them. At this historical juncture, the danger that a shared sense of community among the citizenry disappears seems alarmingly real. Yet, democratic self-government is only possible if citizens can forge a collective political will by changing one another's hearts and minds in public debate. Without an inclusive public sphere, citizens cannot keep the democracies they have got.2 This concern is at the core of Habermas's analysis of the role of social media communication in bringing about a new structural transformation of the public sphere. Indeed, Habermas identifies the inclusive character of the public sphere as the feature that is most in danger of \u201cdisappearing\u201d due to the centrifugal forces of social media communication which yield increased fragmentation, polarization, misinformation, and so on.3 I share Habermas's concern. I am convinced by his analysis of the distinctive threats that social media communication poses to the maintenance of an inclusive public sphere. I also agree with the two main mechanisms that he identifies as most promising for minimizing such threats over the long term: regulations and learning processes. However, I fear that there are some limits to the effectiveness of these mechanisms that Habermas does not discuss. In what follows, I offer a brief overview of Habermas's analysis in order to highlight some of these limits. Although I agree with Habermas that a better distribution of responsibilities between social media platforms and users is urgently needed, I argue that it may nonetheless be insufficient for preventing an increased fragmentation of the public sphere (1). This raises the question of whether there are any alternative developments that can help counteract the negative effects of fragmentation and polarization on the political public sphere in democratic societies. As a tentative answer, I briefly explore the potential contribution that citizens\u2019 assemblies and other deliberative minipublics may make to the maintenance of an inclusive political public sphere (2). In Western countries, it took 300 years until the bulk of the population learned to read and thereby acquired the skills for participating in mass communication. How long will it take us\u2014the educated citizens of the 21st century and first generation of Internet users\u2014to learn how to organize the new media and use them in the right way? (p. xviii) Habermas is certainly right to suggest that it is going to take a long time for Internet users to acquire the skills and the media literacy required to properly participate in digitized communication as authors. This hope about learning processes may partly explain why he takes a less skeptical attitude toward this new structural transformation of the public sphere than he did toward the previous one in his groundbreaking 1962 work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere.4 I agree that we should have a hopeful attitude and avoid misplaced nostalgia for the pre-digital era of traditional media outlets. Yet, there is a worrisome dis-analogy between the two technological revolutions that is relevant in our context. Whereas the bulk of the population simply could not participate in mass communication before learning how to read, Internet users were turned into authors overnight. They are participating in mass communication as authors before acquiring any of the requisite media literacy and without any proper regulations. A better analogy would be letting everyone drive on the highway before passing a driving test and without any traffic regulations. We may not have 300 years to fix the ensuing mess! Leaving this issue aside, I am also not sure that the main threats to the political public sphere derive from the transformation of readers into authors. In fact, the flipside of this phenomenon seems to be much more salient. The most significant threats are posed by the fact that the new social media operators are no longer authors. As Habermas recognizes, social media platforms \u201cneither produce, nor edit nor select.\u201d They thereby disclaim any responsibility for the consequences of the spread of content that is \u201cunregulated because professional filters are lacking\u201d (p. 159). This is a problematic feature that social media operators share with the gig economy generally. In the same way that social media platforms are \u201cempowering all potential users in principle to become independent and equally entitled authors\u201d (Habermas, 2022b, p. 159), platforms like Uber or Lift are \u201cempowering\u201d gig workers to become independent contractors. The flipside of that \u201cempowerment\u201d is that these platforms are no longer \u201cemployers\u201d and can therefore relinquish any responsibility for providing labor protections to gig workers, although the latter cannot secure those protections on their own.5 The main problem with making social media users \u201cauthors\u201d or gig workers \u201cindependent contractors\u201d is that responsibilities are offloaded onto them under conditions in which they cannot properly discharge them. In the case of social media, the problem is not simply that platform users do not have the professional skills and media literacy to properly fulfill the various authorship roles involved in online communication (from editors to reporters, journalists, witnesses, whistleblowers, and so on). This is certainly a problem. But no matter how much social media users improve their authorship skills, there is a clear structural limit. Social media users are also always at the same time passive recipients. Yet, because of the current business model, content spreads across social media according to algorithms that maximize user engagement rather than accuracy. Consequently, targeted recipients often have no way to discern whether the content that appears in their \u201cfeeds\u201d is accurate or false, whether it represents the views of fellow citizens or foreign trolls, whether it is generated by a reliable source or by an online bot using a fake account, and so on.6 To the extent that this is the case, platform users cannot be held responsible for preventing the negative consequences of the spread of misinformation and disinformation, although they certainly contribute to it by sharing, liking, commenting, and so on. Since ought implies can, it is not surprising that online platforms\u2019 creative attempts to relinquish any responsibility are meeting strong resistance. This fight is ongoing. Yet, whereas labor protections for gig workers are still being fought about intensely, content moderation by social media platforms is already here to stay.7 Devastating incidents like Facebook's role in inciting genocidal violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar have brought social media companies under increasing public pressure. Consequently, these companies have not been able to simply declare themselves \u201cplatforms\u201d and their users \u201cauthors\u201d as a way of relinquishing their obligation to act as responsible editors and remove harmful content and misinformation from their sites.8 Now, I do not mean to suggest that leaving content moderation in the hands of private businesses is an optimal solution to the problem. Far from it. But state regulation of content has problems of its own. In addition to the well-known dangers of state censorship, state agencies or courts could hardly adjudicate the tremendous amount of content that platforms remove each day while also maintaining due process guarantees of legal recourse for users.9 A third alternative (with its own set of problems) would be enabling users themselves to control the content that appears in their \u201cfeeds.\u201d This would require the development of technical means (so-called \u201cmiddleware\u201d) to restrict access to unwanted content (Keller, 2022). Currently, it is unclear what the best solutions might be. The problems are complex and constantly evolving due to technological innovations. Each regulatory option carries the risk of having severe negative effects on the quality of the public sphere. Precisely because of this, it is clear that what citizens need to learn about online communication is not so much how to behave as authors but, above all, how to behave as citizens. In democratic societies, citizens are ultimately responsible for demanding adequate regulation of any new technologies and practices that threaten the equal protection of everyone's fundamental rights and freedoms. This does not mean, however, that at this historical juncture, the responsibilities of citizenship vis-\u00e0-vis the social media are any easier to discharge than those of online authorship. To the contrary, Habermas\u2019 observation is correct here too. It is likely to take a long time for citizens to learn how to best regulate the communicative practices enabled by new forms of social media so that their beneficial features are enhanced while their disruptive potential is neutralized. However, in this context, it is also important to note that a lot of the threats that Habermas rightly highlights are neither exclusive nor distinctive of social media. Citizens must demand that any media (whether traditional or digitized) is responsible for not spreading disinformation and misinformation. This is not only happening with respect to social media platforms. It is also happening with respect to TV news channels and other outlets. To take just one salient example: TV news was the main source of early Covid-19 misinformation in the United States. Facebook ranked second.10 the exponential increase and ubiquity of self-enclosed communication networks across the globe\u2026combined with the fact that new media allow readers to instantly become authors communicating on a platform that is uncoupled from the standards of quality journalism\u2026 seems to produce a disquieting shift in the mentality of an apparently growing number of Internet users. They start to communicate exclusively within the bubble of their \u2018preferred\u2019 group and to close their minds to dissonant voices. Such a mentality causes people to lose their grasp upon the inclusive character of the public sphere and, more dangerous still, upon the universal validity of the shared standards of truth and falsity. (Habermas, 2022c, pp. xviii\u2013xix; my italics) Contrary to Habermas's diagnosis, my fear is that although these problems are certainly exacerbated by social media, they are not a product of the unskilled behavior of Internet users bumbling about in the role of authors. In fact, the polarized and self-segregating mentality that Habermas refers to does not seem to be limited to Internet users at all. The question at stake here is whether online communication is generating these problems or whether users are reproducing online what they do (and always already did) offline.11 This is an important question. If the social and political fragmentation that takes place in online networks simply reflects the fragmentation of social networks that results from citizens\u2019 free choices in their offline lives (e.g., where people prefer to live, who they like to talk to and engage with, which news channels they prefer to watch, etc.), it is far from clear that regulations on social media or increased media literacy can address such problems. To once again take an example from the United States: recent studies show that a much higher percentage of Americans are politically segregated through television news channels than through online platforms. Television is indeed the top driver of partisan audience segregation among Americans.12 Moreover, even if it turns out that social media decisively exacerbates the problem, it is also not clear that there is a regulatory mechanism that is compatible with citizens\u2019 freedoms which can impede voluntary online self-segregation (and the ensuing fragmentation, polarization, etc.) any more than there is a mechanism to impede voluntary self-segregation offline (e.g., to regulate citizens\u2019 choices of traditional media outlets, neighborhoods, and schools). The concerning levels of fragmentation and polarization in most democratic societies may be caused by a variety of concurrent factors: a sharp increase in social inequality produced by decades of neoliberal capitalism, a corresponding erosion of solidarity, and the emergence of social media. Whatever the ultimate causes of social fragmentation and polarization are far from clear that increasing media literacy or regulating social media platforms can suffice to address the tendencies of an increasing portion of the citizenry to self-segregate both online and offline. This is not to deny that we need to regulate social media in order to counteract the role that algorithm personalization plays in facilitating the creation of filter bubbles and echo chambers. Nor do I mean to suggest that increasing media literacy and providing Internet users with suitable tools to control the content they are exposed to is not urgently needed. However, to the extent that fragmentation and polarization are not a uniquely online phenomena but something that permeates all aspects of society both online and offline, improving online communication will not be enough to maintain an inclusive public sphere.13 We need additional tools to counteract the negative effects that fragmentation and polarization exert upon the political public sphere. In this context, the increasing popularity of citizens\u2019 assemblies and other deliberative minipublics such as citizens\u2019 juries and Deliberative Polls is not surprising.14 Indeed, the inclusiveness that is characteristic of these deliberative fora provides participants with the exact opposite experience of an echo chamber or a polarized political debate. Without suggesting that these institutional innovations could be a panacea, I would like to briefly indicate some specific contributions that they could make toward maintaining an inclusive political public sphere if they were properly institutionalized. Political debates in the public sphere tend to be dominated by powerful political actors whose interests often deviate from those of the general public. As mentioned, this has only gotten worse with the spread of social media that facilitates the formation of filter bubbles and echo chambers. In the current media environment, citizens have a hard time not only getting themselves informed (as opposed to being bombarded with fake news, misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc.) but, even more importantly, figuring out the considered opinions of their fellow citizens on important political questions\u2014especially those of citizens with whom they disagree. Citizens frequently cannot tell if the views they are exposed to reflect the genuine oppositional opinions of fellow citizens who disagree with them or whether they reflect the manipulated opinions of powerful actors with particular interests that in no way resonate with the citizenry (e.g., lobbyists, hackers, Internet bots, and foreign governments trolls). In such a context, it is not surprising that scholars and practitioners who are familiar with the workings of citizens\u2019 assemblies and other deliberative minipublics are enthusiastic about the quality of political deliberation that they facilitate for participants both online and offline. Minipublics facilitate well-informed, high-quality deliberation on important political decisions among a randomly selected sample of citizens that is descriptively representative of the constituency which will be subject to that decision. Indeed, across all relevant dimensions\u2014inclusion, diversity, access to reliable and balanced information, independence, impartiality, orientation toward the public interest, and so on\u2014the deliberative conditions available to minipublics\u2019 participants are the exact opposite of those that prevail in most social forums currently available to citizens. Thus, it does not seem far-fetched to imagine that as more and more citizens become familiar with the workings of minipublics, they would become increasingly enthusiastic about them. Indeed, if deliberative minipublics were institutionalized for a variety of purposes at the local, national, and even transnational levels, they could become an extremely valuable resource to the citizenry precisely at a time when reliable sources of inclusive, well-informed, impartial political deliberation are getting harder and harder to come by.15 How could minipublics help improve the inclusiveness and the quality of deliberation in the public sphere? To begin with, minipublics could serve some important functions that are not very different from those that traditional media outlets (used to) fulfill. As with the latter, their contribution as a resource for the citizenry would not consist of doing the thinking or deciding for them.16 Rather, it would consist of making the most relevant arguments for and against policies under discussion readily available to citizens.17 Minipublics can do so by filtering out irrelevant or patently manipulative considerations that cannot survive public scrutiny while highlighting the key information, potential trade-offs, and long-term consequences of the available alternatives as evaluated from the diverse political perspectives that resonate with the citizenry of a political community at a given time. Minipublics are particularly well to serve this Precisely to the extent that their randomly selected participants are a of the the reasons and considerations that them to their considered are likely to be those that resonate with the of the citizenry p. Moreover, by highlighting the considerations that are most relevant for a considered on the political issue in minipublics would not only serve the of the of acquiring that of to the public. They would also serve the of out the from the that the that reflects the considered views of some citizens as opposed to the that are to rather than and which are therefore in the of deliberative scrutiny p. the available arguments and providing their considered to their fellow citizens, minipublics could a role in public Minipublics could act as a of in the public sphere by doing the hard of through arguments and providing reasons for the to the of the public. Moreover, due to their minipublics are not only able to public but they can also help the of marginalized that hardly a among the most political it is important to highlight that minipublics\u2019 participants are as diverse as the citizenry and are therefore as likely to disagree in their considered opinions on political as the of the citizenry However, this does not make minipublics the contrary, they can to the citizenry if their and are the and of that resonate with our fellow citizens with respect to political is precisely in when we disagree. the genuine sources of and on specific political opposed to the manipulative and that constantly in the public citizens to out the of information, or that they would need to to their fellow citizens in order to the public debate on these This is precisely what citizens can no longer do in an increasingly and polarized public sphere. is and of at where is of the and of the in is the of without A of Deliberative and and The in and of in the Political and and The Habermas",

      "abstract": "This Special Issue of Business Ethics: A European Review is intended to capture recent advances in corporate social responsibility (CSR), with a particular focus on context and the context dependence of CSR. Our Special Issue was successful on at least those two counts. First, it helped synthesize recent advances in CSR conceptions and applications, drawing on a rich array of theoretical streams, including stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984; Freeman, Wicks, & Parmar, 2004), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), postcolonial theory (Bobby Banerjee & Prasad, 2008), institutional logics (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Thornton, Ocasio, & Lounsbury, 2012), with cross fertilization of insights from the strategy (Porter, 1980; Porter & Kramer, 2011), deliberative democracy (Donaldson & Preston, 1995), and development studies streams (Nelson, 2006; Sink, 1991). Furthermore, our Special Issue helped bring context center stage in considerations of how context shapes not only the lens adopted by CSR scholars, but also the actual boundary conditions within which CSR manifests itself across developed and developing countries (Jamali & Karam, 2016; Jamali, Karam, Yin, & Soundararajan, 2017; Jamali, Lund-Thomsen, & Jeppesen, 2017; Jamali & Neville, 2011). Hence, after 2 years of systematic consideration and follow up and multiple rounds of revisions and reviews, we ended up with a solid collection of seven articles for this Special Issue, which helped to meet at least one or more of the inclusion criteria articulated above. The first article in the Special Issue, entitled Tracing Stakeholder Terminology Then and Now: Convergence and New Pathways by Jennifer Griffin, helps capture recent advances in stakeholder management research, aptly tracing not only how stakeholder research has evolved in the management literature over the past 25 years, but also relevant gaps and avenues for future scholarship. The article is informative in providing a timely review of the recent stakeholder management literature and consolidating this knowledge into a useful organizing framework that focuses on the who (who are the stakeholders?), what (what mechanisms do they use?), and how (how do they interact and affect the focal organization?) or what Griffin refers to as the main stakeholders, relationships, and outcomes that underpin stakeholder management research. The article also contemplates the context of stakeholder relationships, helping in turn to meet our second inclusion criterion for the Special Issue and noting how context invariably shapes in complex ways the managerial and organizational constraints and contingencies placed on stakeholder relationships. The article concludes by identifying important themes emerging from existing stakeholder research and fruitful avenues for future scholarship. The second article in the Special Issue, entitled Examining the Win-Win Proposition of Shared Value across Contexts: Implications for Future Application, by Annika Voltan, Chantal Hervieux, and Albert Mills, examines in turn the concept of creating shared value (CSV) as articulated by Porter and Kramer (2011) and its different uses/applications in recent scholarship. At their core, CSV and CSR have much in common and are more similar than different and thus elucidate some of the same issues. Relying on a critical discourse analysis of 66 recent articles on CSV in developed and developing countries, the authors expose and question the paradoxical positioning of CSV as an instrumental concept that can offer win\u2013win solutions to firms and stakeholders in developed and developing countries. Situating their analysis in postcolonial theory, which recognizes how Western thinking and ideas can be privileged and impact marginalized populations, the authors critically question the universal applicability of CSV across contexts, highlighting important nuances in how developing and developed country scholars approach the concept of CSV. Specifically, the authors note how non-western scholars tend to be more critical of the claims made by Porter and Kramer (2011) and take issue with its firm-centric approach to value creation. The authors conclude by directing attention to the need to move beyond a simplistic unilateral focus on the role of business in value creation, to account for the interactions of business and local stakeholders, the importance of local norms/values as well as inherent power dynamics and relationships in future applications of CSV. They also emphasize in closing the need for a \u201cfundamental rethink\u2014in future scholarship\u2014of the embeddedness of Western notions of value, stakeholders and social responsibility and how they are operationalized and structured.\u201d The third article in the Special Issue, entitled Caught in a Communicative Catch-22: Translating the Notion of CSR as Shared Value Creation in a Danish CSR Frontrunner, by Christiane Marie H\u00f8vring, also examines the notion of CSV and its application in the Scandinavian context. Making use of institutional logics and discourse analysis, the article sheds light on how organizational actors translate the complex predominant institutional logics associated with CSR as shared value while trying to continuously balance and reconcile the contradictory and competing institutional logics pertaining to economy (profit) and society (social welfare) inherent in the notion of CSV. The article hence presents an interesting analysis of how a Danish CSR frontrunner company and its internal stakeholders translate the notion of CSR as shared value creation through discourse, how they grapple with the tensions of competing logics, and how they invariably compromise, tailor, and adapt through reflexive practice and continuous negotiation. The article also nicely captures the permeable boundaries between organizations and the context in which they operate, and how dominant logics in the institutional environment invariably find their way into the organizational context, influencing the discourse and practice on an ongoing basis, both consciously and unconsciously. Conversely, the article also captures the important role and agency of micro-level actors in tailoring their discourse and practice around CSR in such a way as to maintain alignment with broader institutional logics, while taking into account firm-specific idiosyncrasies and peculiarities. The need for multilevel research and analysis of CSR and CSV in context is thus effectively illustrated and the dynamic process of adaptation of CSV and CSR with the circulation of ideas within context and across organizational actors and boundaries (e.g., Jamali et al., 2017; Jamali, Lund-Thomsen, et al., 2017) are also brought to the fore. The fourth article in the Special Issue, entitled Sustainable Banking in Latin American Developing Countries: Leading to (Mutual) Prosperity, by Francisco Javier Forcadell and Elisa Aracil, ponders the question of how CSR manifests itself across multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries in developing countries, recognizing that CSR tends to be institutionally bound and culturally specific. Using a blend of institutional theory and the national business system (NBS) approach, the authors examine how two multinational banks operating in Latin America manage, steer, and adapt their CSR through their subsidiaries in developing countries. They make the case that institutional voids and institutional necessity in developing countries provide ample opportunities for MNCs and their subsidiaries for positive CSR engagement with substantive outcomes. The authors posit financial inclusion and educational-related investments as important institutional necessities in developing countries, where large multinational banks are well-positioned to make a positive difference. Scrutinizing the CSR of two large multinational banks operating in Brazil and Mexico, their findings suggest that both MNCs adapt their CSR to filling institutional voids and addressing relevant local institutional necessities. For example, Bank A in Brazil tailors its CSR interventions to address educational-related investments (through sponsoring the world's largest Spanish speaking higher education platform), while Bank B in Mexico focuses more on financial inclusion (through running the largest private microfinance institution in Latin America) given its salience in the Mexican institutional environment. This tailoring of CSR initiatives to local necessities and priorities translates into mutual prosperity and positive outcomes for both the firm and the host country in question. The fifth article in the Special Issue, entitled An External Perspective on CSR: What Matters and What Does Not?, by Marina Vashchenko, zooms in on the external factors influencing CSR decision making in the context of three large Danish companies. Capitalizing on a blend of institutional theory and stakeholder theory, the article compiles an interesting framework that identifies government-related external factors (e.g., local government CSR, national government CSR, CSR discourse at the political level, industrial CSR regulation, and international CSR standards); societal-related external factors (e.g., pressures from non-governmental organizations [NGOs] and social movement organizations, pressure from the media, business education, and business related publications); and business-related external factors (e.g., institutional investors\u2019 concerns, economic climate, CSR concerns among consumers, CSR requirements from suppliers, level of competition, and requirements for membership in professional associations). The framework is then used to analyze the extent variant combinations of these factors influence CSR-related decisions differently in the context of three large Danish companies (Lego Group, Danske Bank, and the Maersk Group) and whether the nature of influence does in fact change over time. The findings suggest that these external institutional pressures were not equally salient across the three case companies, with Maersk primarily responding to government-related pressures, while Danske Bank reacted primarily to business-related pressures and noting that societal pressures stemming from consumers, suppliers, and NGOs had the least influence across the board. The article also documents the ascendancy of international institutional pressures for CSR in recent years and the salience of government-related institutional factors in a developed country context (which are conversely conspicuously absent in developing countries). Hence, companies are dynamically responding to a mix of institutional pressures in their institutional environment as they enact their CSR. Not only are companies sensitized differently to different institutional stakeholders and institutional pressures in their external environments depending on their particular industry and nature of business (e.g., Jain, Aguilera, & Jamali, 2017), but this is invariably buffered and mediated by the company's previous CSR engagements and its vision/ambition for CSR as documented in this paper. The sixth article in the Special Issue, entitled Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Outcomes: The Role of Country Context, by Tay McNamara, Rene Carapinha, Marcie Pitt-Catsouphes, Monique Valcour, and Sharon Lobel, examines employee perceptions of two different CSR orientations (i.e., internally focused CSR and externally focused CSR) and how these affect in turn employee-related outcomes (e.g., employee engagement and affective commitment) across countries. Focusing more on the micro foundations of CSR, the article examines two employee-level outcomes (affective commitment and employee engagement) in response to two different orientations to CSR (internally focused and externally focused CSR) using data collected as part of a multinational research project, The Generations of Talent Study (a 2009\u20132010 survey of 11,298 employees at 24 worksites within 11 countries). Their findings suggest that perceptions of internally focused CSR enactment were consistently associated with affective commitment across cultural contexts, suggesting that internally oriented CSR invariably bolsters employee commitment to the firm, whereas externally focused CSR was associated with both greater employee engagement and affective commitment. The article also highlights that perceptions of externally focused CSR were more strongly associated with affective commitment in Anglo-Saxon than in Confucian and Latin American countries, suggesting the need for more nuanced country-specific analysis. The seventh article in the Special Issue, entitled Stakeholder Theory: A Deliberative Perspective, by Ulf Henning Richter and Kevin Dow, takes stock of stakeholder theory and tries to extend it normatively, drawing on Habermas, language pragmatic approach, which strongly emphasizes dialogue, participation, and procedural justice as the conditions of legitimation. Hence, the authors argue that a Habermasian approach helps to create a more comprehensive normative foundation of stakeholder theory and addresses in turn the concern of Freeman (1994) in relation to the lack of specificity of the moral implications of stakeholder theory. The normative perspective they provide enhances our understanding of the responsibilities of corporations toward stakeholders in times of globalization and turns attention to the need to bolster procedures of stakeholder deliberations and including marginal stakeholders as we try to address global challenges. The normative strand of stakeholder theory proposed here is inspired by the deliberative democracy paradigm and if put in practice, can go a long way to remedy many of the deficiencies we see in the implementation of CSR across cultural contexts. The authors provide supporting practical examples of what this version of normative stakeholder theory might entail, and why it holds considerable promise in guiding management in the 21st century and remedying global CSR and governance challenges, leading to a more healthy and well-functioning global governance system. With these seven interesting contributions, our Special Issue makes several important advances that move the needle in the global comparative CSR literature. These contributions also help highlight important avenues for future scholarship. To start with, our contributors have managed to draw successfully on well-grounded theoretical streams, including institutional theory, institutional logics, stakeholder theory, postcolonial theory, NBSs approach, discourse analysis, and deliberative democracy, to highlight differences in the conceptions/applications of CSR and CSV across developed and developing country contexts. Institutional theory seems central to teasing out the idiosyncrasies of CSR adaptations across institutional contexts. For example, H\u00f8vring makes clear how firms in a developed country context (e.g., Denmark) are constantly translating the complex predominantly national institutional logics around CSV, while Vashchenko highlights differential firm interpretations of institutional pressures within the same context. Forcadell and Aracil turn attention in turn to the tailoring of CSR expressions based on firm interpretations of institutional voids and institutional necessities in developing countries. It is clear from these contributions that institutional theory and its variants (e.g., institutional logics) are well-positioned to help make important advances in the future comparative CSR literature agenda (e.g., Brammer, Jackson, & Matten, 2012; Jamali & Karam, 2016; Jamali et al., 2017; Jamali, Lund-Thomsen, et al., 2017). Stakeholder theory also comes across as an important theoretical framework that is likely to add value to future comparative scholarship on CSR in developed and developing countries; specifically, the managerial strand of stakeholder theory that identifies and compartmentalizes institutional pressures across specific stakeholder groups is promising (e.g., Vashchenko and H\u00f8vring in this Special Issue; Baranova & Meadows, 2017; Fassin, de Colle, & Freeman, 2017; Freeman et al., 2004; Jain et al., 2017), and so are strands of stakeholder theory that invoke the normative foundations of stakeholder theory (Ritcher & Dow in this Special Issue) and acknowledge interfaces of context with the managerial and organizational constraints and contingencies placed on stakeholder relationships (Griffin in this Special Issue). It is therefore not surprising that the affinities of institutional theory and stakeholder theory are increasingly appreciated in the literature, with scholars invoking a blend of the two theoretical streams to account for the dynamics and expressions of CSR in specific developed and developing country contexts (e.g., Vashchenko in this Special Issue). We hope to see significantly more scholarship in coming years that effectively utilizes a mix of theoretical streams in accounting for relevant CSR relationships and outcomes in context (Frynas & Yamahaki, 2016; Mellahi, Frynas, Sun, & Siegel, 2016). We are also likely to witness interesting breakthroughs from applying NBS frameworks to tease out the influence of national structures on nonmarket (i.e., social) outcomes (e.g., Mellahi et al., 2016; Wood & Frynas, 2006). While the influence of national institutions on economic growth and policy performance is well understood by now, there is considerable scope for contributions around the role of institutional nestedness and configurations in shaping nonmarket outcomes including CSR. We have seen in this Special Issue a good attempt at using the NBS framework and institutional theory to account for the varied interventions of multinational banks in relation to CSR in developing countries (e.g., Forcadell & Aracil in this Special Issue). As the literature on CSR in developing countries continues to mature and grow, the assumption that NBSs are by definition efficient coordination mechanisms is starting to be challenged (e.g., Jamali & Karam, 2016; Wood & Frynas, 2006). As Forcadell and Aracil make clear, we are only starting to tease out the wide range of existing NBS configurations in developing countries, which feature substantial market idiosyncrasies and distinctive social gaps and needs, leading to the differentiated CSR orientations and outcomes in developing countries (see also Jamali & Karam, 2016 and Jamali et al., 2017). At a more practical level, the contributions to the Special Issue make clear that it is time to move beyond a monolithic and simplistic understanding of CSR grounded in Western frames to more organic conceptions that take into consideration the peculiar lens and vantage points of researchers in context. As H\u00f8vring aptly points out, the CSV notion should not be accepted as a universal mantra, and there are important nuances in how developing and developed country scholars approach the concept of CSV. Jamali and Karam (2016), based on a comprehensive review of 451 articles on CSR in developing countries, had similarly noted differences between developed and developing country scholars in relation to the questions asked, the theoretical positions adopted, the framing of business-society relationships, the analysis of CSR expressions, in addition to key issues and stakeholders considered. While in no way intended to augment the developed\u2013developing country divide in CSR research, there is a compelling need to continue to identify and analyze these differences to better inform and advance the international comparative CSR literature, which remains rather thin at best (e.g., Jamali, 2016; Kang & Moon, 2012; Matten & Moon, 2008). Beyond research on developed versus developing country idiosyncrasies, this Special Issue makes clear that there is also potential for significant variation in CSR orientations and engagements within the same country context, whether developed or developing, which are best gauged by attention to the and micro-level factors and accounting for the role of agency of actors in shaping CSR outcomes. of the contributions to this Special Issue Forcadell & Aracil, and that organizational actors are with agency and in complex of and which makes to through the institutional voids and to balance and reconcile internal and external priorities in shaping specific CSR orientations and outcomes. more into the of CSR, et in this Special Issue make clear that perceptions of externally focused CSR were more strongly associated with affective commitment in Anglo-Saxon than in Confucian and Latin American countries, suggesting the need for more nuanced country-specific analysis. beyond institutional idiosyncrasies, there is also a need to continue to with multilevel that the divide and account for the role of and factors in shaping specific CSR orientations and outcomes. we hope this Special Issue is the of a and more systematic advances in CSR research across developed and developing countries. As our Special Issue has helped to important research themes which are in future scholarship. We hope to continue to with this of critical scholarship that recognizes that institutions are important and relevant not only for economic growth and policy but also for understanding complex social dynamics and nonmarket outcomes. the of and the global to CSR as best practice and its across varied contexts, CSR research be from the institutional idiosyncrasies of the context in which it is As nicely put by Forcadell and Aracil in this Special Issue, CSR tends to be institutionally bound and culturally specific and we have a long way to go to the wide range of institutional configurations shaping CSR in context across developed and developing country We also need more research that theoretical streams and to account for the complex dynamics shaping CSR and stakeholder relationships in context. We hope to see more of this scholarship in the coming years that can help inform in turn the of research on CSR in context, and advance the global comparative CSR literature 2016).",

However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d. This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.",

After addressing the crisis of capitalism as a distinct object of critique, this article examines the way some of the most valuable achievements of Critical Theory have depleted its resources for a critique of contemporary capitalism. It then offers a model of critique able to target both injustices rooted in the unequal distribution of power (relational domination) and those rooted in the operative logic of capital reproduction (systemic domination) by focusing attention on the key structural contradictions of contemporary capitalism.",

      "abstract": "In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, J\u00fcrgen Habermas documented the historical emergence and fall of what he called the bourgeois public sphere, which he defined as \u201c[a] sphere of private people come together as a public . . . to engage [public authorities] in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor.\u201d This was a space where individuals gathered to discuss with each other, and sometimes with public officials, matters of shared concern. The aim of these gatherings was not simply discourse; these gatherings allowed the bourgeoisie to use their reason to determine the boundaries of public and private and to self-consciously develop the public sphere. As Habermas writes, \u201c[t]he medium of this political confrontation was . . . people\u2019s public use of their reason.\u201d The bourgeois public didn\u2019t simply participate, but it did so both directly and critically. The development of the bourgeois public as a critical, intellectual public took place in coffeehouses, in salons, and table societies. In Great Britain, Germany, and France, particularly, the coffeehouses and the salons \u201cwere centers of criticism\u2014literary at first, then also political\u2014in which began to emerge, between aristocratic society and bourgeois intellectuals, a certain parity of the educated.\u201d Intellectual equals came together and deliberated, an equality that was key in ensuring the requisite openness and deliberation. No one person dominated the discussion due to his status within the deliberative community. Instead, and above all else, the \u201cpower of the better argument\u201d won out. Two conditions were critical to these deliberations. First, equality was key to the public sphere. Membership in the public sphere meant that no one person was above the other and all arguments were similarly treated and scrutinized. Second, the principle of universal access was crucial.8The doors of the deliberative space were open to all comers and no group or person was purposefully shut out. Seen together, these two conditions provide a blueprint for deliberative practices in a democratic society.",

      "abstract": "Since the financial and economic crisis started in 2008, the acceptability of neoliberalism is increasingly challenged. Arguably, the current situation can be described in Gramscian terms (Gramsci, 1971) as the hegemonic crisis of neoliberalism (Caruso, 2016; Stahl, 2019). Thus, while remaining dominant, neoliberalism has lost its legitimacy: The ruling classes still rule, but they no longer enjoy the consensus of the ruled. This rupture between the \u201cpeople\u201d and the economic and political elites is visible in citizens\u2019 abstention in political elections and low membership rates in political parties (Mair, 2006), in the rise of \u201cpopulism\u201d (D'Eramo, 2013; Mouffe, 2005; Streeck, 2017; Wilson & Swyngedouw, 2014) and in the emergence of social movements for justice and democracy (della Porta, 2015; Glasius & Pleyers, 2013; Kaldor & Selchow, 2013; Tejerina et al., 2013). Thus, like in Gramsci's times, we face today a \u201ccrisis of politics,\u201d which produces a \u201cnew crossroads\u201d between \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d\u2014represented by nationalist and xenophobic populism\u2014and \u201cdemocratization\u201d (Caruso, 2016, p. 156; Fraser, 2017; Rehmann, 2016). Against this background, the ideal of social citizenship may be especially important for building progressive alternatives to neoliberalism (Revi, 2014). The scholarly literature has emphasized that in the neoliberal context, social citizenship is under pressure (e.g., Kurachanis, 2020; Taylor-Gooby, 2008). In particular, given the substantive evidence that welfare retrenchment and austerity erode social citizenship (Edmiston, 2017), contemporary efforts to develop progressive alternatives to neoliberalism have focused on improving social policy generosity, most notably through the \u201csocial investment\u201d agenda. This new welfare model seems to enable the reinforcement of social citizenship in a post-industrial, globalized, knowledge-based economy (Evers & Guillemard, 2013). Social investment aims to rebuild social policy around the enhancement of individuals\u201d human capital and their inclusion in the labor market, emphasizing both the social and economic returns of social policy. This agenda has now emerged as one of the dominant frameworks for welfare reform at the global level, being highly influential among the EU and international organizations, such as the OECD and the World Bank, as well as among social policy scholars (Deeming & Smyth, 2019; Esping-Andersen, 2002; Hemerijck, 2018; Jenson, 2010, 2017a; Mahon, 2010; Young Jun et al., 2021). In this context, the debate on the relationship between social investment and neoliberalism focuses on the degree of social policy generosity: Social investment provides an alternative to neoliberalism because it promotes social policy rather than implementing austerity measures (Abrahamson, 2010; Deeming & Smyth, 2015; Ferrera, 2013; Hemerijck, 2018; Jenson, 2010; Morel et al., 2012; Perkins et al., 2005). In the same vein, distinct versions of social investment are differentiated on the basis of their generosity degree: While the social\u2013democratic version combines compensatory policies (social protection) with social investment policies centered on human capital enhancement, the \u201cThird Way\u201d version partially replaces the former with the latter, thereby providing a weaker break with neoliberalism (Deeming & Smyth, 2015; Morel et al., 2012). However, framing the debate in this manner overlooks the logics and the normative\u2013epistemological assumptions that inform social policy promotion. Indeed, while enhancing social policy generosity constitutes an indispensable step for overcoming neoliberalism, it may be insufficient. In this paper, I argue that the view that equates a post-neoliberal social citizenship with the promotion of social policy is problematic because it involves a rather limited understanding of both social citizenship\u2014which is identified with welfare benefits and services\u2014and neoliberalism, which is defined as welfare retrenchment. Drawing from the normative literature on the ideal of social citizenship and the literature on neoliberalism, this paper thus contributes to the debate on how theorizing social citizenship after neoliberalism. The paper is organized as follows. The next section builds on various normative theories of social citizenship for emphasizing the importance of its political\u2013democratic dimension. The third section, drawing from the literature on neoliberalism, provides a refined interpretation of the latter that goes beyond its narrow identification with austerity and welfare retrenchment. In particular, I argue that neoliberalism does not necessarily involve a \u201cquantitative\u201d reduction of social policy generosity and that it is also important to interrogate the \u201cqualitative\u201d dimension of social policy, i.e., the logic that informs the promotion of social policies, the goals that these policies pursue as well as the social\u2013political processes that generate them. From this viewpoint, neoliberalism entails the marginalization of the political\u2013democratic dimension of social citizenship. Using this framework, the fourth and fifth sections propose a theory of social\u2013inclusive versions of neoliberalism, distinguishing them from alternatives to neoliberalism. Finally, the conclusion elaborates on some implications of this framework for the work of social policy scholars. It is always valuable and intensely practical to consider where our conduct stands in relation to an ideal, since in that way we can try to improve. It is essential to take this approach \u2026 rather than the more common one, which is to scale down definitions of the ideal so that they conform to what we easily achieve. That way lies complacency, self-congratulation, and an absence of concern to identify ways in which democracy is being weakened. Arguably, the ideal of social citizenship represents more than just a set of welfare benefits and services. the that social policy has by & that the ideal of social citizenship involve than the of and Indeed, social citizenship a way in which to be & p. in In particular, from a normative social citizenship involves It is both an of democracy and the of the of these that the ideal of social citizenship a understanding of democracy & While I not have the to the of democracy that this normative the between them. theories of and and Young and and this of democracy a of with to the and model of democracy centered on their by for in elections in which political parties for & p.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to expose the concept of collaborative planning to the reality of planning, thereby assessing its efficacy for informing and explaining what planners `really' do and can do. In this systematic appraisal, we begin by disaggregating collaborative planning into four elements that can enlighten such conceptual frameworks: ontology, epistemology, ideology and methodology. These four lenses help delimit and clarify the object of our examination and provide transparent criteria that guide our examination of collaborative planning's strengths and weaknesses. The second part of this article comprises an empirical investigation of planning processes in Northern Ireland, ranging from region-wide to local and from statutory to visionary. Planning efforts in this province make suitable test cases because special care has been invested in participatory deliberation processes to compensate for the democratic deficits in its mainstream political system. Such efforts have sought to ensure a maximally inclusive planning process. And indeed, the consultation process leading to the Regional Development Strategy, for example, has earned plaudits from leading exponents of collaborative planning. The final analysis provides a systematic gauge of collaborative planning in light of our empirical evidence, deploying the four conceptual dimensions introduced in the first part. This exposes a range of problems not only with the concept itself but also regarding its affinity with the uncollaborative world within which it has to operate. The former shed light on those aspects where collaborative planning as a conceptual tool for practitioners needs to be renovated, while the latter highlight inconsistencies in a political framework that struggles to accommodate both global competitiveness and local democratic collaboration.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Although the literature on multi-stakeholder initiatives for sustainability has grown in recent years, it is scattered across several academic fields, making it hard to ascertain how individual disciplines, such as business ethics, can further contribute to the debate. Based on an extensive review of the literature on certification and principle-based MSIs for sustainability (n = 293 articles), we show that the scholarly debate rests on three broad themes (the \u201c3Is\u201d): the input into creating and governing MSIs; the institutionalization of MSIs; and the impact that relevant initiatives create. While our discussion reveals the theoretical underpinnings of the 3Is, it also shows that a number of research challenges related to business ethics remain unaddressed. We unpack these challenges and suggest how scholars can utilize theoretical insights in business ethics to push the boundaries of the field. Finally, we also discuss what business ethics research can gain from theory development in the MSI field.",

We argue that a sensemaking approach is useful for examining how ethical truces emerge in equivocal situations. To understand how actors navigate through ethical complexity, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry into the multistakeholder practices of setting Fairtrade Minimum Prices. We offer three contributions. First, we develop a process model of ethics as sensemaking that explains how actors come to collectively agree on what is ethical in complex situations, even if no complete consensus arises. Second, our findings suggest that moral intuition and affect also motivate ethical judgment alongside moral reasoning. Third, an ethical sensemaking perspective explains some of the pitfalls actors confront in coping with ethical complexities in practice and how they attend to the challenges arising from stark inequalities in extreme contexts.",

A process of aggregation leads from local practices of designing participatory procedures like the citizens jury, planning cell, or consensus conference in the 1970s and 1980s, to the disembedding and proliferation of procedural formats in the 1990s, and into the trans-local consolidation of participatory practices through laboratory-based expertise since about 2000. Our account highlights a central irony: anti-technocratic engagements with governance gave birth to efforts at establishing technoscientific control over questions of political procedure. But such efforts have been met with various forms of reflexive engagement that draw out implications and turn design questions back into matters of concern. An emerging informal assessment regime for technologies of participation as yet prevents closure on one dominant global design for democracy beyond the state.",

Design/methodology/approach Content analysis is used to investigate reports published by 299 companies that have adopted Global Reporting Initiative guidelines. This paper studies how organizations engage stakeholders, the categories of stakeholders that are being addressed, the methods used to support stakeholder engagement, and other features of the stakeholder engagement process. Companies that disclose stakeholder perceptions, the difficulties met in engaging stakeholders, and actions aimed at creating opportunities for different groups of stakeholders to interact were subjects of discussion in a series of semi-structured interviews that focus on DA. Findings Companies often commit themselves to two-way dialogue with their stakeholders, but fully developed frameworks for DA are rare. However, signs of DA emerged in the analysis, thus confirming that sustainability reporting can become a platform for DA systems if stakeholder engagement is effective. Originality/value The findings contribute to the accounting literature by discussing if and how sustainability reporting and stakeholder engagement can serve as vehicles of DA. This is accomplished via a research design that is based on in-depth interviews and content analysis of various sustainability reports.",

      "abstract": "In many policy areas demands for enhanced citizen participation have been met in the last twenty years or so. Recently, the participatory discourse has entered the till then highly expert-oriented debates over science and technology policy-making. In the field of technology assessment in particular, different types of participatory procedures have been developed that aim to include stakeholders, those directly affected and/or the general public at local, national, or even supranational level. Numerous procedures have been employed\u2014above all with regard to social conflicts over biotechnology\u2014in many European countries, but also elsewhere in the world.The debate on participatory technology assessment (pTA) is influenced by an almost romanticising picture. Participatory procedures are believed to (1) increase the motivation of those involved, (2) enhance the knowledge and values basis of policy-making, (3) initiate a process of social learning, (4) open up opportunities for conflict resolution and achieving the common good, and (5) improve the level of acceptance and legitimacy of political decisions. A more direct relation between citizens and policy-makers shall foster democracy and accountability. I argue that these claims are based on a reductionism of what \u2018true\u2019 democracy is, i.e. deliberative democracy, whereas empirical research on the impacts of participatory procedures displays a more differentiated picture. Participatory procedures are still in an experimental stage; their linkages to the institutions of representative democracy vary from case to case and from country to country\u2014and are, by and large, weak. Consequently, many procedures have, at best, a limited impact on the socio-technological conflict and its resolution. I claim that participatory procedures do not per se improve the democratic legitimacy and accountability of policy-making. In order to do so, their linkage to the political system has to be reconsidered and improved\u2014empirically as well as conceptually.",

Notwithstanding, in-depth scholarly analyses of deepfakes' political impact are rare, and do not consider theories of democracy. This contribution helps close this research gap, drawing on Warren's problem-oriented democracy theory, as well as theories of deliberative democracy and contributions on the role of trust in democracies. I identify three core functions of democratic systems and their normative foundations, namely empowered inclusion, collective agenda and will formation (supported by deliberation), and collective decision-making. Based on a literature and media analysis, I systematize different types of deepfakes serving either disinformation or hate speech and outline how they weaken core democratic functions and norms: Deepfakes impede citizens' empowered inclusion in debates and decisions that affect them, e.g. by hampering efforts to hold political representatives accountable or further marginalizing certain societal groups such as women or ethnic minorities. Deepfakes also undermine collective agenda and will formation by threatening the epistemic quality of deliberation as well as citizens' mutual empathy and respect. This culminates in a decreased legitimacy of collective decisions taken, which is additionally threatened by pervasive (but mostly speculative) fears of deepfake election manipulation. My analysis has implications for (future) governance efforts addressing deepfakes. Such efforts are increasing, e.g. on the part of social media platforms, but also (supra-)national regulatory bodies.",

      "abstract": "Criticism against identity politics, both in public discourse and political theory, has intensified over the past decade with the rise of right-wing populism and the polarization of politics (Walters, 2018). Such criticism portrays identity politics as a threat to democracy, alleging that it erodes community, rational communication, and solidarity. Drawing on radical democratic and standpoint theories, I argue for the opposite thesis; namely, that identity politics is crucial for the democratization of democracy. I show that democratization works through disrupting hegemonic discourse and is, therefore, a matter of power; and that such power politics are reasonable when following minority standpoints generated through identity politics. In other words, the universal democratic claims of equality and freedom can only become effective through their repeated actualization in particular power struggles. Identity politics is a contested term. Nevertheless, there are systematic overlaps between current criticisms of identity politics that mainly repeat arguments that have been similarly articulated since the 1990s. Communitarians criticize identity politics as dividing the political community, liberals criticize it as disruptive of the public sphere and free deliberation (Fukuyama, 2018; Habermas, 2020; Lilla, 2017), and Marxist and anarchist theorists argue that identity politics undermines the struggle for justice and emancipation and stabilizes state power through neoliberal diversity politics (Fraser, 1990, 2007; Kumar et al., 2018; Newman, 2010; T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2, 2022; for a critique of these debates, see Bickford, 1997; Walters, 2018; Young, 2000, pp. 82\u221287; Paul, 2019). Based on universalist accounts of the political,1 all three positions share the concern that particularist identity politics conflates social positions with epistemological possibilities and political positions, resulting in standpoint fundamentalism. In other words, the critics claim that, in identity politics, it matters more who speaks than what is said.2 Discussions about difference (Benhabib, 1996), counterpublics (Fraser, 1990), and inclusion (Young, 2000) at the intersection of deliberative and Critical theory early criticized such universalist accounts of the political for their exclusionist effects. While these works offer valuable resources to construct the argument that strengthening identity politics is important for the development of more inclusive deliberations and institutions, they frame this as a correction of reason, leaving the aspect of power underdeveloped. To understand both the severe resistance against more inclusive politics and the strategic need for non-deliberative means to achieve it\u2014such as protest, civil disobedience, \u201ccancel culture,\u201d or uprising\u2014what is necessary is a theoretical framework that describes democratization as an oscillation between power and reason. Even Mansbridge (1996) does not offer such a theoretical framework, despite explicitly arguing\u2014contrary to deliberative democracy\u2014that power through coercion is central for democracy and rightly points to the need for \u201cprotected enclaves\u201d (p. 57) for the development of minoritarian standpoints. As the tension between power and reason, and respectively, particularism and universalism, is at the center of agonistic3 radical democratic theory (Laclau & Mouffe, 2001; Lefort, 1988a; Mouffe, 2008; Ranci\u00e8re, 1999), it is better suited to develop such a framework than deliberative approaches.4 This tension should not be understood as one where identity politics is positioned on the side of particularism and its critics on the side of universality; rather, it is constitutive of identity politics, and in extension, democracy itself. \u201cIdentity politics\u201d\u2014in the sense of the history of the term's origin as well as the current debate\u2014refers to the political practice of marginalized groups who, in relation to the construction of a collective identity and standpoint, defend themselves against their disadvantages due to structures, cultures, and norms of the majority society. Following Combahee River Collective (1979, p. 365), a Black feminist organization, identity politics can be defined as \u201cfocusing upon our own oppression,\u201d thus starting from particular experiences and standpoints. However, this should not be conflated\u2014as some contemporary critics do\u2014with essentialist interest group politics. Rather, identity politics is directed against oppression in general, insofar as it is an intersectional and \u201cintegrated analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are interlocking\u201d (Combahee River Collective, 1979, p. 362). This oscillation between particularist and universalist accounts of oppression is not a flaw in the Collective's text but stems from the inherent tension within identity politics. This tension has been discussed in the rich debates on identity politics, especially in the writings of intersectional feminism (Alcoff, 1988; Alcoff et al., 2006; Bickford, 1997; Briskin, 1990; Gamson, 1995; Hekman, 1999; Kruks, 1995; McNay, 2010; Nicholson, 2008; Whittier, 2017; see also the edited volumes, Benhabib et al., 1995; Hames-Garcia & Moya, 2000; and for an overview, see Bernstein, 2005; as well as Heyes, 2020). However, there is no systematic account of the tension between particularism and universalism in these works, which, indebted to that tradition, I will develop with the aim of strengthening it. As \u201cidentity politics\u201d is a contested term, alternative conceptual strategies exist. For example, Young (2000) speaks of the \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d of \u201cstructural social groups\u201d to describe what I call \u201cidentity politics,\u201d while, following critics (pp. 82\u201387), she uses the term \u201cidentity politics\u201d for the tendency toward substantialist, merely cultural, and potentially non-intersectional exclusive group-interest politics (p. 86). As the common understanding of \u201cidentity politics\u201d entails the breadth of the politics of marginalized I it is important to and that term, of to a term that is not This conceptual that, in general, the politics of marginalized groups democratization and of does not that all identity politics are argument is thus not a for practice of identity rather, the of the of identity politics is not only but also as it a of identity politics from exclusive group-interest politics and identity political they show to develop exclusive group-interest politics. To understand identity politics as a oscillation between power and reason, the radical democratic account has to be through standpoint I will in the following I will the of both theoretical a in the that is of these a critique of common of and the of In to the and Marxist accounts that are based on universalist of the these argue that through of universal discourse through the of particular identity politics is central to the democratization of democracy.

      "abstract": "Abstract Community development often involves organizing participatory decision-making processes. The challenge is for this to be meaningful. Participatory decision-making has the potential to increase the transparency, accountability, equity and efficiency with which public administration serves the least privileged in society. However, in practice, it often fails to bring about these outcomes. A number of academics and practitioners have, therefore, theorized how participatory decision-making processes can better empower marginalized groups. By critically reviewing this body of work and empirically grounding the debate in recent practice, we aimed to develop a theoretically rigorous, easily applicable and holistic model of an inclusive participatory decision-making process that can work across a range of contexts. The empirical strand included surveying public engagement practitioners and participants about the participatory events they had organized or attended. These empirical findings were combined with insights from the theoretical literature to devise a new conceptual model of emancipatory, inclusive and empowering participatory decision-making \u2013 the \u2018Tree of Participation\u2019. The model can be useful to both organizers of participatory processes, as a check for empowering and inclusive practice, and to disadvantaged groups, as a set of expectations and demands when engaging in public decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In recent years there has been a growing interest in new participatory forms of urban governance. This introduction provides readers with a basic review of current debates in the literature and a summary of the articles presented in the symposium. The introduction highlights two major tensions in the literature. First, many scholars operate under an assumption that plural actors can achieve a lasting and rational consensus on certain issues. Others believe that where there is consensus, there is also a silenced margin. For these critics, rather than focusing on building power\u2010laden consensus, it is better to recognize and respect conflict and difference as normal parts of the governance process. Second, the introduction considers some of the possibilities for cross\u2010national comparisons of participatory governance regimes. Scholars should not limit their analyses to institutional designs across countries but assess the importance of particular sociopolitical contexts in giving formal institutions their actual meanings and functions. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Derni\u00e8rement, les nouvelles formes participatives de gouvernance urbaine ont fait l'objet d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat accru. Ce texte introductif pr\u00e9sente un bilan rapide des d\u00e9bats qui animent la litt\u00e9rature actuelle, ainsi qu'une synth\u00e8se des articles propos\u00e9s pour le symposium. On trouve deux lignes d'opposition principales dans les publications. En premier lieu, de nombreux chercheurs partent du principe qu'une pluralit\u00e9 d'acteurs peut atteindre un consensus durable et rationnel sur certains sujets. D'autres sont convaincus que s'il y a consensus, une minorit\u00e9 est \u00e9galement r\u00e9duite au silence ; selon eux, au lieu de se consacrer \u00e0 b\u00e2tir un consensus dans un rapport de force, il vaut mieux admettre et respecter conflit et diff\u00e9rence comme des composantes normales du processus de gouvernance. En second lieu, cette introduction envisage certaines possibilit\u00e9s de comparaisons transnationales de syst\u00e8mes de gouvernance participative; les sp\u00e9cialistes ne devraient pas limiter leurs analyses aux concepts institutionnels internationaux, mais \u00e9valuer plut\u00f4t l'importance des contextes sociopolitiques particuliers lorsqu'il s'agit de donner aux institutions formelles leur sens et fonctions r\u00e9els.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Putting the recently adopted global Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement on international climate policy into action will require careful policy choices. Appropriately informing decision-makers about longer-term, wicked policy issues remains a considerable challenge for the scientific community. Typically, these vital policy issues are highly uncertain, value-laden and disputed, and affect multiple temporal and spatial scales, governance levels, policy fields, and socioeconomic contexts simultaneously. In light of this, science-policy interfaces should help facilitate learning processes and open deliberation among all actors involved about potentially acceptable policy pathways. For this purpose, science-policy interfaces must strive to foster some enabling conditions: (1) \u201crepresentation\u201d in terms of engaging with diverse stakeholders (including experts) and acknowledging divergent viewpoints; (2) \u201cempowerment\u201d of underrepresented societal groups by co-developing and integrating policy scenarios that reflect their specific knowledge systems and worldviews; (3) \u201ccapacity building\u201d regarding methods and skills for integration and synthesis, as well as through the provision of knowledge synthesis about the policy solution space; and (4) \u201cspaces for deliberation\u201d, facilitating direct interaction between different stakeholders, including governments and scientists. We argue that integrated, multi-stakeholder, scientific assessment processes\u2014particularly the collaborative assessments of policy alternatives and their various implications\u2014offer potential advantages in this regard, compared with alternatives for bridging scientific expertise and public policy. This article is part of a collection on scientific advice to governments.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Global multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) are important instruments that have the potential to improve the social and environmental sustainability of global supply chains. However, they often fail to comprehensively address the needs and interests of various supply-chain participants. While voluntary in nature, MSIs have most often been implemented through coercive approaches, resulting in friction among their participants and in systemic problems with decoupling. Additionally, in those cases in which deliberation was constrained between and amongst participants, collaborative approaches have often failed to materialize. Our framework focuses on two key aspects of these breakdowns: assumptions about the orientation of MSI participants, and the deliberation processes that participants use to engage with each other to create these initiatives and sustain them over time. Drawing from stakeholder and deliberation theories, we revisit the concept of MSIs and show how their deliberative capacity may be enhanced in order to encourage participants to collaborate voluntarily.",

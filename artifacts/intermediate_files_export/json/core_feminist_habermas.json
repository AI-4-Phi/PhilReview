      "abstract": "In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, J\u00fcrgen Habermas documented the historical emergence and fall of what he called the bourgeois public sphere, which he defined as \u201c[a] sphere of private people come together as a public . . . to engage [public authorities] in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor.\u201d This was a space where individuals gathered to discuss with each other, and sometimes with public officials, matters of shared concern. The aim of these gatherings was not simply discourse; these gatherings allowed the bourgeoisie to use their reason to determine the boundaries of public and private and to self-consciously develop the public sphere. As Habermas writes, \u201c[t]he medium of this political confrontation was . . . people\u2019s public use of their reason.\u201d The bourgeois public didn\u2019t simply participate, but it did so both directly and critically. The development of the bourgeois public as a critical, intellectual public took place in coffeehouses, in salons, and table societies. In Great Britain, Germany, and France, particularly, the coffeehouses and the salons \u201cwere centers of criticism\u2014literary at first, then also political\u2014in which began to emerge, between aristocratic society and bourgeois intellectuals, a certain parity of the educated.\u201d Intellectual equals came together and deliberated, an equality that was key in ensuring the requisite openness and deliberation. No one person dominated the discussion due to his status within the deliberative community. Instead, and above all else, the \u201cpower of the better argument\u201d won out. Two conditions were critical to these deliberations. First, equality was key to the public sphere. Membership in the public sphere meant that no one person was above the other and all arguments were similarly treated and scrutinized. Second, the principle of universal access was crucial.8The doors of the deliberative space were open to all comers and no group or person was purposefully shut out. Seen together, these two conditions provide a blueprint for deliberative practices in a democratic society",

Second, in Parts III and IV, I place the questions raised in Dale in another context in which they belong but are seldom analyzed, that of the jurisprudence of public accommodations laws . . . In conclusion, I join the two major themes by framing Dale\\u27s claim as the latest in a series of cases that have invoked an evolving understanding of citizenship. What is specifically at stake in Dale is the relationship between civic status and gender and sexuality. What it illustrates more broadly is the need for a contemporary social theory of citizenship that encompasses the discursive dynamics and power of the institutions of civil society",

      "abstract": "We cannot continue to look at public sphere as a space of privileged, following an Habermasian logic. In this sense, an idealized definition of public sphere is created drawings upon equality opportunities and upon its intervenient rationalism, where the author clearly tries to retrieve Kantian sense of freedom. However, he focuses on male power holders and citizens\u2019 participation.\r\nMoreover, public sphere is nowadays marked by multiple positions and actors that magnify its interactions. We are particularly interested on the uses of public sphere on media by its transformative capacity and the swell of a democratic space for every individuals. The breach of this sphere and its consequent fragmentation has functioned almost paradoxically: on one hand it allows subjects to position themselves and to take a stand but, on the other hand, it reinforces status quo, depriving other subjects from public sphere agency. This discursive (im)permeability carried out by the media against certain groups and individuals has raised debate in many areas. Feminist critique\u2019s legacy has been extremely relevant to this public sphere conceptual evolution and reformulation, contributing to a more plural and equality conceptualization; one that is truly close to citizens and its idiosyncrasies. Feminist critique to Habermas\u2019 bourgeois public sphere comes, first of all, from the recognition of women\u2019s exclusion, as well as of other specific social groups, from figuring in society and from having an active part, therefore excluding them from democratic citizenship.\r\nThe role of media, however, does not seem easy, as it is one of the privileged vehicles for information dissemination playing an important contribution to citizenship. Yet, in this junction there are diverse social actors that intend to enroll public decision-making. We know that public opinion is shaped mainly by parameters that prioritize some discourses over others, giving them more prominence and power. By highlighting these discourses, assigning greater emphasis to certain themes and people, media equally contribute to the formation and delimitation of public sphere boundaries. In this complex relationship established, and based on a critical feminist outlook, we intend with this paper to question the existence of a single public sphere or of several ones, and to question how far are mainstream media (im)permeable to emancipatory and resistance discourses. Finally, we will question, as well, how does public sphere and democracy notions articulate themselves with the increasing individualism promotion taking place in Western societies.This paper was developed under the scope of the research project \u201cGender in focus: social representations in Portuguese generalist newsmagazines [G\u00e9nero em foco: representa\u00e7\u00f5es sociais nas revistas portuguesas de informa\u00e7\u00e3o generalista]\u201d (PTDC/CCI-COM/114182/2009) funded by FCT - Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation).

      "abstract": "The deliberative conception of the public sphere has proven popular in the critical evaluation of the democratic role of media and communication. However, the conception has come under sustained critique from poststructuralist- infl uenced theorists, amongst others, for failing to fully account for the exclusions that result from it being defi ned as a universal norm of public sphere deliberation. This paper examines how this critique may be answered. It does so fi rst by exploring how (sophisticated) deliberative theory can reply to the critique, and second by turning to the poststructuralist-infl uenced critics - specifi cally post-Marxist discourse theorists - and asking how they might provide a way forward. With respect to the fi rst, the paper fi nds that deliberative theory can, and often does, account for the exclusions in question much more than critics suggest, but that there remains concern about the conception's radical democratic status given that exponents (seem to) derive it extra-politically. With respect to the second, the paper fi nds that a post-Marxist discourse theory reading - that embraces radical contingency - of the deliberative public sphere conception provides a purely political framework for theorising deliberative exclusion (and associated politics), and thus off ers an ontological and democratic radicalisation of the public sphere conception. However, given the embrace of radical contingency, and thus acceptance of inelminable power, the paper concludes by indicating that this radicalisation may illicit concern about its radical democratic status",

It sketches how projects of the Muslim public self contribute to a refiguring of the public sphere. The argument put forward is that public practices of self-reform grounded in religion and presented in pietistic terms are political by virtue of being tied to projects of societal reform and because they have a bearing on the public sphere and public space. Proceeding from the premise that the public sphere is not neutral and that the subjectivities inhabiting it are shaped by power relations, the article examines the ways in which projects of Muslim public selves are imbricated in the material conditions of the settings in which they develop and as such are underpinned by dynamics of power and contestation",

      "abstract": "The core idea of J\u00fcrgen Habermas public sphere has to do with forming a public made of private individuals who participate in civic dialogue on issues of common interest. A public so formed generates public opinion through the formation of a communicative network. This essay argues that the communicative network of the public sphere which is known to be strengthened by its cultural connects through press and mass media can also be shaped by popular music culture like hip-hop, rock or electronic dance music. A cultural public sphere is comprised of numerous networks of mass and popular culture which help in shaping the participants\u2019 articulations of politics, both public and personal. Cultural public sphere marks the entry of affective modes of communication as effectual participation in the politics of everyday life. In this article, the author tries to position the role of popular music cultures in the formation of a public sphere by studying three distinct forms of popular music- hip-hop, rock and electronic dance music. The idea is to understand the role of the communities formed due the affective mode of popular music and the efficacies granted to these social groups in the larger context of a public sphere. Another important dimension of studying these forms of popular music is to understand music festivals as active sites for the realisation of a public sphere. Drawing from Durkheim\u2019s idea of how festivals harness within them a \u2018collective effervescence\u2019 which he found to be an integral element to aid in instilling feelings of solidarity in a community, this essays tries to locate the popular music festival sites within the framework of a cultural public sphere by conducting an in depth literature review on how the traditional public sphere is critiqued from the vantage point of a cultural public sphere; how popular culture texts and practices inform these critiques and finally how music festival sites act as public spheres",

      "abstract": "In a critical but sympathetic reading of Habermas\u2019s work (1984, 1987a, 1987b, 2003), Luke Goode (2005) recently sought to rework his theory of deliberative democracy in an age of mediated and increasingly digital public spheres. Taking a different approach, Alan McKee (2005) challenged the culture- and class-bound strictures of Habermasian rationalism, instead pursuing a more radically pluralist account of postmodern public spheres. The editors of this special section of Media, Culture & Society invited us to discuss our differing approaches to the public sphere. Goode holds that the institutional bases of contemporary public spheres (political parties, educational institutions or public media) remain of critical importance, albeit in the context of a kaleidoscopic array of unofficial and informal micro-publics, both localized and de-territorialized. In contrast, McKee sustains a \u2018hermeneutics of suspicion\u2019 toward the official, hegemonic institutions of the public sphere since they tend to exclude and delegitimize discourses and practices that challenge their polite middle-class norms.\\ud\n\\ud\nMcKee\u2019s recent research has focused on sexual cultures, particularly among youth (McKee, 2011). Goode\u2019s recent work has examined new social media spaces, particularly in relation to news and public debate (e.g. Goode, 2009; Goode et al., 2011). Consequently, our discussion turned to a domain which links our interests: after Goode discussed some of his recent research on (in)civility on YouTube as a new media public sphere, McKee challenged him to consider the case of pornographic websites modelled on social media sites.1 He identifies a greater degree of \u2018civility\u2019 in these pornographic sibling sites than on YouTube, requiring careful consideration of what constitutes a \u2018public sphere\u2019 in contemporary digital culture. Such sites represent an environment that shatters the opposition of public and private interest, affording public engagement on matters of the body, of intimacy, of gender politics, of pleasure and desire \u2013 said by many critics to be ruled out of court in Habermasian theory. Such environments also trouble traditional binaries between the cognitive and the affective, and between the performative and the deliberative.\\ud\n\\ud\nIn what follows we explore the differences between our approaches in the form of a dialogue. As is often the case, our approaches seemed less at odds after engaging in conversation than may have initially appeared. But important differences of emphasis remain",

      "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to examine Habermas\u2019s account of the transformation of the public sphere in modern society. More specifically, the study aims to demonstrate that, whilst Habermas\u2019s approach succeeds in offering useful insights into the structural transformation of the public sphere in the early modern period, it does not provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding the structural transformation of public spheres in late modern societies. To the extent that the gradual differentiation of social life manifests itself in the proliferation of multiple public spheres, a critical theory of public normativity needs to confront the challenges posed by the material and ideological complexity of late modernity in order to account for the polycentric nature of advanced societies. With the aim of showing this, the paper is divided into three sections. The first section elucidates the sociological meaning of the public/private dichotomy. The second section scrutinizes the key features of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere by reflecting on (i) the concept of the public sphere, (ii) the normative specificity of the bourgeois public sphere, and (iii) the structural transformation of the public sphere in modern society. The third section explores the most substantial shortcomings of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere, particularly its inability to explain the historical emergence and political function of differentiated public spheres in advanced societies",

      "abstract": "Social media has become a key term in Media and Communication Studies and public discourse for characterising platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, Wordpress, Blogspot, Weibo, Pinterest, Foursquare and Tumblr. This paper discusses the role of the concept of the public sphere for understanding social media critically. It argues against an idealistic interpretation of Habermas and for a cultural-materialist understanding of the public sphere concept that is grounded in political economy. It sets out that Habermas\u2019 original notion should best be understood as a method of immanent critique that critically scrutinises limits of the media and culture grounded in power relations and political economy. The paper introduces a theoretical model of public service media that it uses as foundation for identifying three antagonisms of the contemporary social media sphere in the realms of the economy, the state and civil society. It concludes that these limits can only be overcome if the colonisation of the social media lifeworld is countered politically so that social media and the Internet become public service and commons-based media.\n\nAcknowledgement: This paper is the extended version of Christian Fuchs\u2019 inaugural lecture for his professorship of social media at the University of Westminster that he took up on February 1st, 2013.

      "abstract": "This paper examines the subjugation of Nigerian women with regard to how their political marginalisation constricts the public sphere, the resource centre of public opinion, which strengthens the ideals of democracy and good governance. The political marginalisation of women in Nigeria is a rectilinear upshot of their low participation in government and politics necessitated by patriarchy. This patriarchal practice has animated the urgency of expanded public sphere as well as feminism, an ideological, aesthetic and cultural movement, steeped in agitating for the rights of women and expanding the frontiers of their participation in the political process. In the political novel Anthills of the Savannah, which is to be considered in this paper, Chinua Achebe has deftly refracted the rise of new Nigerian women, who are generation changers. Beatrice represents Achebe\u2019s new women; her portraiture in the novel interrogates postcolonial Nigerian politics of disempowerment, marginalisation, shrunken public sphere and gendered space that occlude good governance",

      "abstract": "When online videos mobilize protestors to occupy public spaces, and those protestors incorporate hashtags in their chants and markered placards, deliberative democratic theory must no longer dismiss technology and peoples historically excluded from the arena of politics. Specifically, political models must account for the role of repetition in paving the way for unheard and unseen messages and people to appear in the political arena. Drawing on Judith Butler\u2019s theory of the Performative and Hannah Arendt\u2019s Space of Appearance, this paper assesses that critical and generative role of iteration. Repeating unheeded acts performs the capacity for those acts to be entered into discourse. The World Wide Web evidently augments such performativity with features such as accessibility, potential for \u2018viral\u2019 proliferation, and an endurance unlike non-networked acts. This paper eventually grapples with the hazards and risks of networked repetition (e.g. desensitization, trivialization, etc.) in order to propose a poetics of repetition to mitigate those dangers. Such poetics ultimately distinguishes the witness from the spectator",

El cuerpo de la mujer se queda exterior y ajeno a la esfera moderna de la autonom\u00eda y sigue siendo una posesi\u00f3n: pose\u00eddo, reapropiado, cubierto y expuesto, se convierte en campo de batalla para los conflictos identitarios de la mo\u00acdernidad tard\u00eda. Por otro lado, la aspiraci\u00f3n a la autonom\u00eda, transformada en deseo de consumo, causa que se convierta en un espect\u00e1culo y en una mercanc\u00eda, es decir, en un patio de recreo del orden neoliberal. Ciertas tendencias en el feminismo contempor\u00e1\u00acneo reflejan esta versi\u00f3n mim\u00e9tica de la libertad, haciendo al feminismo vulnerable al nuevo esp\u00edritu del capitalismo (Fraser, 2009) y a los discursos populistas y xen\u00f3fobos de la derecha.The article aims at analysing how the use of \u201cfeminist\u201d arguments by xenophobic, right \u2013wing and populist discourses\u2013 constitutes a specific form of neutralisation of feminism. In European public discourse, women\u2019s freedom is becoming a pawn in a political game that has nothing to do with women themselves. Women\u2019s bodies \u2013posses\u00acsed, re-appropriated, impregnated, covered and uncovered\u2013 become battlefields for the \u201cidentity conflicts\u201d of late modernity. On the other hand, the aspiration to autonomy, re-narrated in late capitalism in terms of freedom to consume, causes women bodies, exposed, spectacularised, commodified, to become the playgrounds of neo-liberal order (Fraser, 2009). Some trends in contemporary feminism reflect this mimetic version of freedom, thus contributing to make feminist critique suitable to the spirit of new capi\u00actalism and easily manipulated by xenophobic, right-wing populist discourses",

In charting changes in these calls and their ideas on the role of social research in society, the article draws out lessons for future orientation. Whilst highlighting that the contribution of social research to our common understanding is part of its vitality, different authors have sought to see it in terms of how social actions are produced in research texts, via the role of experience as a starting point for reflexivity, to deploying exclusion of the researcher from dominant forces in order to produce more accurate explanations of social relations. Overall, we can be left bewildered in the face of these differences. Yet the article concludes by arguing that each has its place for clarifying the role and place of social research in society, but that they should not be over-extended as that produces an inward-looking perspective and leads to a paralysis in practice",

The main argument is that not only issues of access to and exclusion from public spheres are relevant for an understanding of media and pluralism. Background assumptions and ideologies about media technologies and their functioning also require more comparative analysis, as they impact public spheres and claims to authority and authenticity that ultimately produce and shape scenarios of ethnic and religious diversity. This additional dimension of diversity in the question of media and ethnic and religious pluralism is particularly apparent in crises of political and religious mediation. The latter often result in desires to bypass established forms of political and religious mediation that are in turn often projected on new media technologies",

      "abstract": "Abstract:This article interprets Teresa Brennan's (2004) work on the forgetting of affect transmission in conjunction with Sylvia Wynter's (2003) argument concerning the rise of Western Man through the dehumanization of native and African peoples. While not directly in dialogue, Wynter's decolonial reading of Foucault's (1994) epistemic ruptures enriches Brennan's inquiry into this \"forgetting,\" given that callous, repeated acts of cruelty characteristic of Western imperialism and slavery required a denial of the capacity to sense suffering in others perceived as differently human. Supplementing Brennan with Wynter, we can better describe the limits of sympathy discourses as resting on identification and perceived sameness. In turn, Brennan (posthumously) comes to Wynter's defense in her call for a new science of plural cultures to redefine the human, which some have interpreted as a positivist misreading of Frantz Fanon (2008). Brennan and Wynter alike have been criticized for their appeals to science; yet, I defend their respective proposals for social-scientific inquiry with support from Brennan's response to the 1996 Sokal Hoax: the influence of the social on the biological body is, indeed, difficult to study, but this does not invalidate the inquiry as such.",

      "abstract": "The idea that rights are possessions that are given and lost is so ubiquitous within the dominant discourse that its metaphoricity is forgotten. This amnesia naturalises possessive individualism, allowing rights practices to be shaped by the colonial episteme. Furthermore, the metaphor of possession turns rights into tools of oppression by producing zero-sum economies of rights that foster division through the perception that for a certain group to gain rights, another must lose some. An example of this invidious narrative is the claim made by anti-transgender activists that the rights of trans women \u2018clash\u2019 with the rights of cis women. Inspired by Sylvia Wynter, this article aims to intervene by examining the coloniality of the concept of rights that the anti-trans position presupposes, connecting this to the coloniality of the immutable sex-gender ontology that it defends. Motivating anti-trans feminism, I argue, are the epistemic and libidinal rewards of sacrificial relationality. Seeking a non-possessive concept of rights that could resist zero-sum politics and capture the simultaneity of struggles for liberation, I then turn to Mar\u00eda Lugones and her critique of categorial purity, asking whether metaphors of enmeshed rights could unsettle the episteme of Man while shifting the terms of the trans debate.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Decolonial and post-colonial critiques have shown how rights naturalise a normatively white, Western bourgeois, and appropriative subject, while negating other forms of being and subjectivity. Given the disquiet around rights and their subject, reimagining the subject of rights calls on us to think \u2018after rights?\u2019. Thinking \u2018after rights?\u2019, and insisting on the question mark, I argue, entails seeking the \u2018undared shape\u2019 (Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire) of rights untethered from the figure of sovereign Man. Sylvia Wynter\u2019s historical-philosophical critique of Man, and search for the human \u2018after Man\u2019, are central for understanding the colonial-modern order and the role of rights within this. Extending Wynter\u2019s orientations, I first analyse how rights are implicated in modernity-coloniality\u2019s material and symbolic violences. Second, I examine Wynter\u2019s amplification of sociopoetic struggles \u2013 those wide-ranging modes of sociality and cultural, survival practices \u2013 by Man\u2019s enslaved and colonised Others. Such struggles aimed to displace Man as locus of colonial-modern structures, forging new meanings and modes of world-making untethered from this hegemonic figure. Importantly for rights and world politics scholarship, sociopoetic struggles work with abolitionist-reparative intent towards modernity-coloniality and its master subject. Finally, I consider what renarrating the human outside Man's horizon \u2013 as abnormative, insovereign and anti-individualist praxis \u2013 means for human rights.",

The only possibility for challenging this inconceivability, asserts Sylvia Wynter, is to rewrite our current order of knowledge such that it refuses the overrepresentation of European man and opens to multiple co-existential and relational modes of humans being. While the call to rewrite is a call to rethink, reimagine, re-curricularize knowledge processes, it should also compel a reconsideration of the act of academic writing, as a key site where Black and other disenfranchised people are rendered less than human or not human at all. And as such it is also the site, upon which Black and other disenfranchised people have historically intervened \u201ccutting and augmenting\u201d meaning with sound to announce the presence of Black/Human and to bring forth new insights toward the project of rewriting the current order of knowledge in the interests of a multiple/co-existential rendering of humans being.",

      "abstract": "This paper engages Sylvia Wynter\u2019s theory of the hybrid human as a prism for reading Leslie Marmon Silko\u2019s 1977 novel Ceremony. Wynter\u2019s work aims at decolonizing Western categories of knowledge, positing the notion of an Autopoetic Turn/Overturn to unsettle the coloniality of Man as an epistemo-ontological category. The epistemic break Wynter envisions to catalyze this unsettling involves an understanding of the human as a hybrid species, made up of biological as well as symbolic life, bios and mythos. Such an understanding of the human is revealed in Silko\u2019s novel, as its protagonist, Tayo, undergoes a ritual of ceremonial healing that mirrors Wynter\u2019s Autopoetic Turn/Overturn, disentangling himself from Western modes of knowledge by scripting a new story for himself and his people. Drawing on two of Wynter\u2019s essays that carry \u201cCeremony\u201d in their titles, my paper explores the intersections between Wynter\u2019s theory and Silko\u2019s fiction. By showing how Silko fictionally reenvisions new futures of being hybridly human beyond the category of Man, this essay points to epistemic pathways of decoloniality not predicated on anger.",

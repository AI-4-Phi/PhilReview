      "abstract": "In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, J\u00fcrgen Habermas documented the historical emergence and fall of what he called the bourgeois public sphere, which he defined as \u201c[a] sphere of private people come together as a public . . . to engage [public authorities] in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor.\u201d This was a space where individuals gathered to discuss with each other, and sometimes with public officials, matters of shared concern. The aim of these gatherings was not simply discourse; these gatherings allowed the bourgeoisie to use their reason to determine the boundaries of public and private and to self-consciously develop the public sphere. As Habermas writes, \u201c[t]he medium of this political confrontation was . . . people\u2019s public use of their reason.\u201d The bourgeois public didn\u2019t simply participate, but it did so both directly and critically. The development of the bourgeois public as a critical, intellectual public took place in coffeehouses, in salons, and table societies. In Great Britain, Germany, and France, particularly, the coffeehouses and the salons \u201cwere centers of criticism\u2014literary at first, then also political\u2014in which began to emerge, between aristocratic society and bourgeois intellectuals, a certain parity of the educated.\u201d Intellectual equals came together and deliberated, an equality that was key in ensuring the requisite openness and deliberation. No one person dominated the discussion due to his status within the deliberative community. Instead, and above all else, the \u201cpower of the better argument\u201d won out. Two conditions were critical to these deliberations. First, equality was key to the public sphere. Membership in the public sphere meant that no one person was above the other and all arguments were similarly treated and scrutinized. Second, the principle of universal access was crucial.8The doors of the deliberative space were open to all comers and no group or person was purposefully shut out. Seen together, these two conditions provide a blueprint for deliberative practices in a democratic society",

High-speed internet should be considered a basic right because it connects people to social media, the new public sphere. Critics worry about the politically polarizing effects of online social media, but its ability to unify, connect, and shape policy decisions should also be taken into account. Engaging with J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s early work on the public sphere, I argue that the technical and cultural extension of access to social media can realize Kant\u2019s vision of the public sphere as a bridge between morality and politics",

In conclusion, I join the two major themes by framing Dale\\u27s claim as the latest in a series of cases that have invoked an evolving understanding of citizenship. What is specifically at stake in Dale is the relationship between civic status and gender and sexuality.

      "abstract": "The public sphere debate in social theory has been a topic of considerable interest amongst scholars analysing the talk show genre. Habermas (1989) attached great importance to the potential of rational critical discussion to create consensus and thereby legitimation in democratic society. He was concerned that the media gave a false impression of engagement in a public sphere while managing rights of access and speech in a manner that was inimical to open public discussion. In contrast, cultural commentators on the talk show genre have been impressed by the richness and spontaneity of interactions on the shows, suggesting that they might have a positive role in public participation despite not meeting Habermas\u2019s criteria for a public sphere. In consequence, the literature is moving away from the public sphere debate and focussing on issues of voice and expression in analyses of talk shows. This paper, however, makes the argument that many of Habermas\u2019s concerns are still highly relevant to the genre. This is demonstrated through an analysis of the Jerry Springer Show. On the surface, this show seems to have little to do with rational critical discussion. The analysis reveals a number of parallels between the conception of the rational critical public sphere and the Jerry Springer show, leading to a revision of the received view of Habermas\u2019s work in the analysis of mediated discussion. A range of implications for the mediation of deliberation, participation and expression are explored",

      "abstract": "While it is true that the most recent presidential election cycle highlighted deeply rooted divisions lying in our American democracy, there is more to this separation than politics. Globalization and polarization have acted as catalysts, in part, to the decline of neighborliness and citizenship in America. I argue that a return to the \u201cpublic\u201d sphere in local communities can remedy this. This paper tests this theory by strategically selecting public policies and civic engagement activities that attempt to accomplish this goal of returning to the public and evaluating them on their ability to do so.\nThere are important questions about improving citizenship and neighborliness and how both are related that will be explored. Ultimately, if a return to the public sphere is the best way to heal a broken democracy plagued by division, there must be ways to create that sphere. Whether it is more sidewalks and front porches or better ways to approach uncomfortable conversations is what this paper aims to recommend for community planners and civic organizations.\nThis paper is twofold in its approach, detailing both the theoretical arguments in favor of creating a public space that promotes both improved citizenship and neighborliness and then practically applying methods of doing so. American democracy as we know it is changing quickly, and a return to the public sphere cannot bridge all the gaps, but it is a place to start bringing citizens and neighbors of place together to form a community atmosphere that has declined steadily for decades",

Because postmodenism has undermined the structure and function of the society and gives extra power to the periphery and individuals, the rise for individual participation in voicing out their need and wants is seen as important so that decision made at the top rung of the society reflect the masses. According to Habermas, in post modern era where tradition is lacking, people are losing trust and confidence in an abstract system \u2013 the system governing them beyond their immediate surrounding. To encounter it, citizen should be given power to participate in decision making. Habermas idea is supported by Giddens with his social reflexivity concept that suggests inputting public trust back into social institution. In coherence with this argument, the paper will discuss on the public complaint in public institution which is seen as a way to improve public services. The study is carried out in Student Affairs department in Universiti Utara Malaysia in 2003. The objectives of the study is to measure the level of awareness of the services offered at the Complaint Unit HEP and complaints by the students of the university. The paper will then discuss the findings and suggests ways to improve existing systems so that the quality of service is further enhanced",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe emergence of the transnational as a site and object of governance has triggered concern amongst both affected publics subject to these effects, and scholars keen to locate the democratic potentials therein. Increasingly, public sphere theory is being promoted as a lens for interrogating the democratic potential of the transnational. However the project of transposing public sphere theory from its Westphalian origins to the transnational has been frustrated by a lack of empirical examples in which the properties of a transnational public sphere can be easily identified. In this article, examining the encounter between La V\u00eda Campesina and the UN Committee on World Food Security, I argue for the existence of a nascent transnational public sphere in the specific domain of transnational food and agricultural policymaking. The existence of this concrete example, I argue, defends public sphere theory\u2019s transnational turn against either the charge of utopianism, or the need to suspend some of the framework\u2019s core conditions in order to accommodate the \u2018actually possible\u2019. It also allows us to advance public sphere theory\u2019s empirical research agenda, and in this article I introduce an analytical framework to take this further.</jats:p",

Unfortunately, the current yet dominant form of public reasoning is infiltrated by biases from occidental culture. This mode of reasoning does nothing but uproot participants from their cultural identity for the sake of universal consensus. Multicultural society, however, consists of identities which are embedded in the individuals' cultural tradition. This sociological fact demands a richer form of rationality that does not deny the multiplicity of cultural values and embedded identities. We need a form of public reasoning which emphasizes cultural understanding rather than abstract consensus. We might call it a multicultural, contextualized and other-regarding form of public reason",

      "abstract": "When online videos mobilize protestors to occupy public spaces, and those protestors incorporate hashtags in their chants and markered placards, deliberative democratic theory must no longer dismiss technology and peoples historically excluded from the arena of politics. Specifically, political models must account for the role of repetition in paving the way for unheard and unseen messages and people to appear in the political arena. Drawing on Judith Butler\u2019s theory of the Performative and Hannah Arendt\u2019s Space of Appearance, this paper assesses that critical and generative role of iteration. Repeating unheeded acts performs the capacity for those acts to be entered into discourse. The World Wide Web evidently augments such performativity with features such as accessibility, potential for \u2018viral\u2019 proliferation, and an endurance unlike non-networked acts. This paper eventually grapples with the hazards and risks of networked repetition (e.g. desensitization, trivialization, etc.) in order to propose a poetics of repetition to mitigate those dangers. Such poetics ultimately distinguishes the witness from the spectator",

New communications environments were seen to be instrumental in forging the conditions for the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 revolutions and the Turkish protests within Istanbul\u2019s Taksim square during the summer of 2013. These Middle Eastern case examples are discussed along with the calls for political and economic change in Southern Europe within financially constrained countries of Spain and Greece.

Cory Wimberly uses archival materials and wide variety of sources \u2014 Foucault\u2019s work on governmentality, political economy, liberalism, mass psychology, and history \u2014 to mount a genealogical challenge to two commonplaces about propaganda. First, modern propaganda did not originate in the state and was never primarily located in the state; instead, it began and flourished as a for-profit service for businesses. Further, propaganda is not focused on public beliefs and does not operate mainly through lies and deceit; propaganda is an apparatus of government that aims to create the publics that will freely undertake the conduct its clients\u2019 desire.\n          \n          Businesses have used propaganda since the early twentieth century to construct the laboring, consuming, and voting publics that they needed to secure and grow their operations. Over that time, corporations have become the most numerous and well-funded apparatuses of government in the West, operating privately and without democratic accountability. Wimberly explains why liberal strategies of resistance have failed and a new focus on creating mass subjectivity through democratic means is essential to countering propaganda.\n          \n          This book offers a sophisticated analysis that will be of interest to scholars and advanced students working in social and political philosophy, Continental philosophy, political communication, the history of capitalism, and the history of public relations",

      "abstract": "We cannot continue to look at public sphere as a space of privileged, following an Habermasian logic. In this sense, an idealized definition of public sphere is created drawings upon equality opportunities and upon its intervenient rationalism, where the author clearly tries to retrieve Kantian sense of freedom. However, he focuses on male power holders and citizens\u2019 participation.\r\nMoreover, public sphere is nowadays marked by multiple positions and actors that magnify its interactions. We are particularly interested on the uses of public sphere on media by its transformative capacity and the swell of a democratic space for every individuals. The breach of this sphere and its consequent fragmentation has functioned almost paradoxically: on one hand it allows subjects to position themselves and to take a stand but, on the other hand, it reinforces status quo, depriving other subjects from public sphere agency. This discursive (im)permeability carried out by the media against certain groups and individuals has raised debate in many areas. Feminist critique\u2019s legacy has been extremely relevant to this public sphere conceptual evolution and reformulation, contributing to a more plural and equality conceptualization; one that is truly close to citizens and its idiosyncrasies. Feminist critique to Habermas\u2019 bourgeois public sphere comes, first of all, from the recognition of women\u2019s exclusion, as well as of other specific social groups, from figuring in society and from having an active part, therefore excluding them from democratic citizenship.\r\nThe role of media, however, does not seem easy, as it is one of the privileged vehicles for information dissemination playing an important contribution to citizenship. Yet, in this junction there are diverse social actors that intend to enroll public decision-making. We know that public opinion is shaped mainly by parameters that prioritize some discourses over others, giving them more prominence and power. By highlighting these discourses, assigning greater emphasis to certain themes and people, media equally contribute to the formation and delimitation of public sphere boundaries. In this complex relationship established, and based on a critical feminist outlook, we intend with this paper to question the existence of a single public sphere or of several ones, and to question how far are mainstream media (im)permeable to emancipatory and resistance discourses. Finally, we will question, as well, how does public sphere and democracy notions articulate themselves with the increasing individualism promotion taking place in Western societies.This paper was developed under the scope of the research project \u201cGender in focus: social representations in Portuguese generalist newsmagazines [G\u00e9nero em foco: representa\u00e7\u00f5es sociais nas revistas portuguesas de informa\u00e7\u00e3o generalista]\u201d (PTDC/CCI-COM/114182/2009) funded by FCT - Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation).

This article approaches the dynamics between the cultural and the political public sphere from the point of view of religion; how the cultural intelligentsia developed its worldview fuelled with attitudes towards religion in times of political turmoil. The case study, based on the empirical analysis of cultural periodicals and societies around them, concerns the Finnish liberal intelligentsia in the early twentieth century. The first decade of the 1900s was a particularly important period of formation for the Finnish public sphere; the societal turmoil highlighted the importance of cultural periodicals in defining what was important for the national public sphere. The case of religion is an illustrative example of it, particularly from the point of view of the liberal intelligentsia of the era.Peer reviewe",

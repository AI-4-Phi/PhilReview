      "abstract": "It has been more than 15 years since the philosopher Enrique Dussel published Ethics of Liberation in the Age of Globalization and Exclusion in Spanish; its recent publication in English points to how it has become a touchstone for contemporary critical thinking. The importance of this work lies, on the one hand, in how it demonstrates the force of philosophical thought that reproduces itself in the periphery of the world-system and, on the other hand, in how it poses theoretical, ethical, and political questions radically important for humanity in this third millennium. In this sense, the book questions the hegemonic ethics that postulates the \u201csave who you can\u201d ideology of capitalism and even justifies social Darwinism.We have before us a work that from the introduction confronts the hegemonic vision of history \u2014 in Walter Benjamin's sense of the term \u2014 as not part of the Hellenic world but of North Africa and the Middle East, relativizing the role of Europe in the formation of a global culture. One should note that this historical description has the \u201cphilosophical intent\u201d of calling into question the myth of modernity, the ideology of progress, and alleged Western superiority (p. 1).In the first part, \u201cFoundation of Ethics,\u201d the author states the three primary principles (or moments) that configure the architectural framework of the book. First is the \u201cmaterial principle,\u201d which touches upon \u201csuffering corporeality\u201d derived from the victim's negative experiences (p. 284). Second is the \u201cformal principle of morality\u201d (p. 141), which refers to the application of the truth/validity norm and furthermore most valuably reformulates the \u201cdiscourse ethics\u201d proposed by Karl-Otto Apel (p. 121); this principle maintains a fruitful dialogue with and complements the material principle. Last is the \u201cprinciple of feasibility,\u201d which focuses upon context or environment, consequently weighing what is factually possible. With this principle, the instrumental role of reason is properly placed by precisely subsuming it to a single objective: the production, reproduction, and development of human life in community. Yet the author mentions that no perfect system or institution exists, maintaining that every system always produces an unintentional negative effect.In the second part, \u201cCritical Ethics, Antihegemonic Validity, and the Praxis of Liberation,\u201d the author lays out the other three principles that configure the ethics of liberation. First is the \u201cethical-critical principle,\u201d a structurally central component and part of the negativity of the victims. Following the reflections of Karl Marx, critical theory, and Emmanuel Levinas, Dussel postulates the creation of a new ethical system based upon a universal rationality of liberation that has as a reference point the alterity and exteriority of the victim. Second, the \u201cprinciple of validity\u201d addresses the necessity and possibility of a situation of intersubjective consensus to conform to this new ethics. Following the thinking of Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, the author rehabilitates the role of utopia in ethical and social projects. The last principle, the \u201cliberation principle,\u201d is the moment when the victims raise themselves to a radical transformation of the system, or, in other words, when they leave the situation of material negativity in which they find themselves. In this regard, the author addresses a prickly subject for contemporary political philosophy: violence. While the author suggests that we are not naive to advocate violence, he notes that it exists as an unavoidable resource with which you always have victims. The author also retakes the most valuable aspect of Marxist philosophical thought by approaching the question of the constitution of subjects, of historical actors who, in their praxis, envision building a just, free, and democratic society.Finally, the validity and coherence of the ethical material proposed by the author reveal themselves obviously, since it takes as its starting point the pain of the bodily reality of the victims in order to rebuke the destructive logic of this \u201cactually existing modernity.\u201d In this sense, I maintain that Ethics of Liberation marks an important point not only in the trajectory of this Argentine philosopher but also in the development of the history of contemporary thought. For this, I consider the publication and diffusion of this monumental work in the English-speaking world important.",

      "abstract": "Enrique Dussel is Latin America\u2019s foremost philosopher, renowned for his contributions to ethics, political philosophy, and liberation theology. Designed for classroom use, this collection of essays engages with Dussel\u2019s encyclopedic work, making his valuable contributions accessible to English-speaking students. In addition to being one of the most original, prolific, and widely known members of the Latin American Philosophy of Liberation movement, Dussel has also made important contributions to world philosophy, the history of philosophy, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and the understanding of Karl Marx. Dussel famously engaged in a decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel on the relationship between material and formal ethics\u2014that is, between an ethics of the community of life and an ethics of the community of discourse\u2014and he has produced novel interpretations and analyses of the concepts of alterity, exteriority, the other, and the world history of ethical systems. Most recently, Dussel extended his work on an ethics of liberation into a politics of liberation, developed over the course of three published volumes. In this book, scholars from around the world assess Dussel\u2019s work in ways that are both appreciative and critical. Two essays by Dussel bookend the volume: the collection opens with a consideration of the (im)possibility of multiple modernities and ends with an autobiographical trajectory of the philosopher\u2019s thinking. In addition to Dussel and the editors, the contributors to this volume include Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff, Don Thomas Deere, Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, Mario S\u00e1enz Rovner, Alejandro A. Vallega, and Jorge Z\u00fa\u00f1iga M.",

      "abstract": "The paper examines the current debates regarding the grounding of human rights in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. It analyses the challenges which come today from certain policies of human rights which instrumentalize them under the pretext of a \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d and redefi ne them in terms of democracy promotion and regime change, as well as those challenges which come from ideologies which question the core principles of human rights and provoke the so called \u201ccrisis of legitimization.\u201d The paper argues for the necessity of restoring the genuine meaning of human rights and of the role of citizens in striving for their implementation. At the heart of the analysis is Kant\u2019s concept of human rights as freedom. With Kant as its backdrop, the paper shows that the claim that religious worldviews provide the only intelligible foundation, as in Nicholas Wolterstorff, faces serious challenges in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. The paper then analyzes the non-religious philosophical concepts which seek to develop an account of human rights that does not depend upon controversial metaphysical or religious doctrines. It examines an account of human rights from the perspective of discourse ethics as developed by Karl-Otto Apel and J\u00fcrgen Habermas. It also analyses the concepts of human dignity and \u201cemerging morality\u201d by Arturo Roig and the \u201cethics of liberation\u201d by Enrique Dussel. The analysis shows the ongoing relevance of Kant\u2019s ideas and their recent development by the theorists of discourse ethics and of dialogical and democratic cosmopolitanism. Key words: human rights, freedom, dignity, cosmopolitanism, Kant.",

      "abstract": "This essay addresses some recent theoretical developments that are laying an important role in the decolonization of knowledge.That knowledge has been colonized raises the question of whether it was ever free.The formulation of knowledge in the singular already situates the question in a framework that is alien to precolonial times, for the disparate modes of producing knowledge and notions of knowledge were so many that knowledges would be a more appropriate designation.Unification was a function of various stages of imperial realignment, where local reflections shifted their attention to centers elsewhere to the point of concentric collapse.On their way, those varieties of knowledge coalesced into knowledge of the center, and successive collapses of centers under the weight of other centers led, over time, to the global situation of the center and its concomitant organization of knowledges into knowledge.This path has not, however, been one exclusively built upon alienation, for along with the strange and the alien were also the familiar and the, at times, welcomed.Enrique Dussel is a member of a community of scholars who have questioned the logic of self reflection offered by the most recent stage of centered productions of knowledge. 1 The philosophical framework of such rationalization is familiar to most students of Western philosophy: Ren\u00e9 Descartes reflected on method in the seventeenth century, grew doubtful, and articulated the certainty of his thinking self in opposition to the fleeting world of physical appearance.A result of such intellectual labor is a shift of first questions from meditations on what there is to what can be known.This focus on epistemology as first philosophy charted the course of philosophy in modern terms against and with which contemporary philosophers continue to struggle and grapple.For political thinkers, the new beginning is a little earlier, in the late fifteenth-through early sixteenthcentury reflections on politics by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.Against these intellectualist formulations of modern life, Dussel raises the question of its underside, of the geopolitical, material impositions and the unnamed millions whose centers collapsed not simply from the force of ideas but sword and musket.That modernity was ironically also identified by Machiavelli but often overlooked through how he is read today: in The Prince, Machiavelli wrote of the effects of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella's victory over the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula. 2His focus on the repression wrought in the name of Christendom presumed, however, the continued significance of the Mediterranean in the commerce of world-constituting activity.Dussel's work argues that the continued conflict spread westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and by October of that year, 1492, a series of new relations were established with a New World that de-centered the Mediterranean, stimulated a new economy and, with it, an organization of its management (new epistemologies), and re-aligned the western peninsula of Asia into a new political territory in the form of a continent, namely, Europe.Prior to the emergence of Europe, there were maps of the Mediterranean that would have to",

      "abstract": "Liberation philosophy, as a Latin American project for critical thought, is one among many expressions of a shift in global power dynamics and in epistemic perspective that has taken place since the Second World War.*The European crisis, or more than a crisis, its own internal devastation after the war, opened at least three paths for the train of history and thought.On the one hand, the United States -which had proven itself as an international power through the expansion from the thirteen colonies, the war with Mexico, and the Spanish-American War -became after the Second World War a hegemonic force that would both assist and displace Northwestern Europe as the power-axis of the modern world-system.With this, Americanism -the triumphalist and assimilationist ideology of the United States which had already burst onto the scene with Theodore Roosevelt in the late nineteenth century -was decisively introduced to the rest of the world.This Americanist discourse would dictate the terms for the assimilation of non-Catholic European immigrants, some of which were seen as belonging to darker races. 1 This ideology has taken various turns with McCarthyism and Reagan in the context of the Cold War, and today it takes on a new spirit in formulations like that offered by Samuel P. Huntington, who has forcefully rearticulated Americanism with respect to immigrants and ethnic minorities in the United States. 2 But today, after the Cold War and the attacks of 11 September, it is no longer European immigrants that allegedly pose a \"challenge\" to U.S.-American identity, but rather Latin American (im)migrants, particularly Spanish-speaking Mexicans and Chicana/os. 3 There is, accordingly, a particular importance today for exploring the decolonial potential of those cultural forms originating in Latin America, Mexico, and in the borderlands between Mexico and the United States, among other \"frontier\" territories both to the north and south of this border. 4e second path that opened with the decline of Europe was, clearly, that of the Cold War rival of Americanism: Soviet communism.Soviet communism, or at least socialism (which is a different but related political system/ideology), would become for many a viable option for a different future, beyond both fascist and liberal Europe.Europe itself would come to be divided between these two newly regnant ideologies and neo-imperial geo-political projects.Other regions also suffered the force of this clash of political projects, while many nations tried to find a space between or in alliance with the two dominant blocs.Now, the decline of Europe opened a third path, which we will call -following Frantz Fanon -that of the \"wretched of the earth,\" as well as the \"de-colonial turn.\" 5 This door would be definitively forced open through the combination of the internal and external devastation of Europe, that is to say, not only by the perverse force of Nazism in its interior but also by the encouraging force of the decolonization of European territories abroad.In contrast to the Latin American liberation struggles of the nineteenth century, which took place in a context in which the weakening of Southern Europe left intact the fascination with the increasing strength of Northern Europe (especially France and England), mid-twentieth century Europe was destroyed by Nazism and completely demoralized.As the",

      "abstract": "After considering the proper tone for my participation in this \"dialogue\" between Europeans and Latin Americans about \"Critical Theory,\" I have concluded that my argumentative strategy should primarily be to take seriously the \"subjects\" of the dialogue and their locus enuntiationis: who we are and from where we speak.These sorts of dialogues are not frequent nor are their terms obvious, 1 and it is even less common for such a debate to occur symmetrically, by which I mean that it takes place between philosophers within a community of horizontal communication who are respected as equals, as colleagues, but who nevertheless demand to be recognized in their alterity.Such efforts are not exempt from a certain degree of incommunicability and incommensurability that can create misunderstandings, but are nonetheless united by a solidaristic will to attempt to advance a critical philosophy with global validity.Such a philosophy, which would accordingly set out from the perspective of those excluded from the global system (peripheral countries) and those excluded within particular states (impoverished masses), has not existed to date: I consider its construction the specific task of philosophy in this twenty-first century that we are beginning. The first contacts with the Frankfurt School (with the \"first generation\")As for myself, I participate in what we have called the \"Philosophy of Liberation,\" 2 which since its origin has maintained a constant dialogue with Critical Theory.Just as the events of Paris '68 did not have the same meaning as those in Berkeley, the Latin American context was equally distinct. 3 Paradoxically, under military dictatorships (imposed by the Pentagon and the Kissinger Doctrine between 1964 and 1984), the works of Marcuse -and especially One-Dimensional Mancame to influence us within a context that was similar to the totalitarian horror under which the first Frankfurt School was born (the \"first generation\").The \"dirty war\" which led to the murder, torture, and disappearance of thousands would last almost two decades (as in Brazil, for example). 4 But along with Marcuse, we read the Martinican Frantz Fanon's Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth, 1961), since our reflections were situated in the post-colonial periphery, in the global South.Moreover, our reference point was critical social science -like Dependency Theory, which was later continued by Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory.This global structure of inequality finally burst onto the scene since the Clinton administration under the name of \"globalization\" (which passed from a period characterized by the internationalization of the productive part of capital -as transnational corporations -to a financial and monetarist era with global implications).The point of all this is the following: our first lesson in Critical Theory was non-Eurocentric.My 1975 work Philosophy of Liberation begins thus:From Heraclitus to Karl von Clausewitz and Kissinger, \"war is the origin of everything,\" if by \"everything\" one understands the order or system that the world dominators control by their power and armies [...] I am trying, then, to take space, geopolitical space, seriously.To be born at the North Pole or in Chiapas is not the same thing as to be born in New York City. 5 Through the first Frankfurt School, we discovered \"materiality\" in the sense of living corporeality, a question that does not frequently interest those dealing with the theoretical positions of the School 6 : \"Whoever resigns himself to life without any rational reference to self-preservation would, according to the Enlightenment -and Protestantism -regress to prehistory.\" 7 \"Materiality,\" for the Frankfurt School, consists of an affirmation of living corporality (Leiblichkeit) as in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, which is vulnerable and has desires (Freud), and which needs food, clothing, and shelter (Feuerbach).This anthropological materiality, a far cry from Soviet dialectical materialism, was perceptibly close to our situation in an impoverished, starving, and suffering Latin America.In the Southern Cone, the multitude of demonstrations shouted: \"bread, peace, and work!\" three necessities that refer strictly to life, to the reproduction of its corporeal content (Leiblichkeit).For that reason, the political-economic sphere had a special relevance for us, as did the need for a frontal critique of capitalism (Marx).Will, affectivity and emotions, unconscious drives, and economic requirements were all integrated into the discourse of the first Frankfurt School.But its subject was a \"negative\" materiality, focusing especially on the negative effects of the dominant system, its pain and misery.The \"positivity\" of the system always obscures the \"negativity\" over which it is constructed: \"Hence the convergence of specific materialism with criticism, with social change in practice [...] to abolish suffering.The telos of such an organization or society would be to negate the physical suffering of even the least of its members.\" 8\"Philosophy of Liberation\" set out from the locus enuntiationis of the material victim, from the negative effect of authoritarianism, capitalism, and patriarchy.However, this is the root of a profound divergence with Critical Theory that continues up to the present (and which should be an explicit subject of our dialogue), that of the material negativity of colonialism (of the indigenous peoples, the African slave, the Opium Wars in China, etc.), a phenomenon which corresponds to metropolitan capitalism, Modernity, and Eurocentrism.The victim for us was no longer -as for Horkheimer, Habermas, or the \"third generation\" of Critical Theory -only the worker, the persecuted Jew in Auschwitz, the citizen under Nazism, women, or the working world facing the crisis of the welfare state.We were equally concerned with the victims of a global system (a globalized World-System 9 since 1492), which included the Latin American hacienda system that exploited indigenous people, the mita system of indigenous slave labor which extracted silver (colonial capitalism's first global currency) from mines like that at Potosi in Bolivia, the plantations of African slaves brought to tropical America, the Indian women forced to serve as concubines for the conquistador, the children brought up with Christianity (cultural domination through foreign religion), etc.It was in this context that the ontological category of Totality 10 -so important for Hegel,",

A base positiva dessa filosofia nos desafia a romper com o sil\u00eancio das vozes dos oprimidos, dos explorados ou das v\u00edtimas, que n\u00e3o foram considerados agentes relevantes na constru\u00e7\u00e3o da sociedade moderna (mulheres, \u00edndios, escravos, sertanejos etc.). A Filosofia da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o se baseia nos conceitos de totalidade, exterioridade, aliena\u00e7\u00e3o, media\u00e7\u00e3o, proximidade e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o. A totalidade, fundamentada pela pretens\u00e3o conquistadora dos colonizadores, d\u00e1-se a partir de uma dimens\u00e3o ontol\u00f3gica que revela a verdade como aquela decorrente dos que se julgam superiores por sua domina\u00e7\u00e3o tecnol\u00f3gica ou econ\u00f4mica. Esse discurso resultou na exterioridade daqueles que n\u00e3o integram originalmente esse p\u00fablico, excluindo-os do sistema e atribuindo a eles a aliena\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 a nega\u00e7\u00e3o do seu status de sujeito. Afirmamos a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o quando substitu\u00edmos a consci\u00eancia cr\u00edtica da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o pela leitura da m\u00eddia popular de neg\u00f3cios, pela ret\u00f3rica das consultorias e pela cren\u00e7a de um livre mercado em que, naturalmente, n\u00e3o haver\u00e1 recursos para todos, mas apenas para aqueles que prosperarem em um cen\u00e1rio de incertezas. A teoria cl\u00e1ssica da economia naturaliza a competi\u00e7\u00e3o e a exterioridade, entretanto, podemos nos organizar para atender \u00e0s necessidades populares de modo mais inclusivo, democr\u00e1tico e respeitando os limites da natureza. A proximidade e a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o a chave do pensamento te\u00f3rico para a supera\u00e7\u00e3o dessa vis\u00e3o.",

Taking this debate as an immediate point of reference, in the present article I delve into the problematic around which this dialogue pivoted: the foundation of the positive ethical-material principle of life proposed by Dussel. Furthermore, this problematic comes about as one of the challenges and objections which Karl-Otto Apel made for Ethics of Liberation. Finally, this paper focuses on showing an alternative foundation which Dussel presented as the proposition to the challenge that Discourse Ethics posited, thereby demonstrating what I call the principle of the impossibility of the living subject and nature as well as the formulation of a complementary transcendental argument to this principle.",

This paper shows the outstanding conclusions of each of the participants as results of reflecting on each others view: But, before, we expose the historical and philosophical beginning of discourse ethics (Apel) and ethics of liberation (Dussel), we will introduce to the basic conceptual elements of each theory. As conclusions of the dialogue we describe the ethical conceptions in both authors, their views, the role of ethics in a globalized world, the basic sources to face moral problems, etc. Finally, to make sense of the polemic and conclusions raised by both philosophers, we state the most important aftermaths on the contemporary moral life.",

In this paper, we honor and disseminate the Brazilian original body of knowledge on OS and introduce an OS agenda that is liberated from M.",

Utilizing an approach derived from Louis Althusser\u2019s isolation of the radical implications of the epistemological break of Karl Marx, from his Feuerbachain theological thought to a materialist epistemological tradition, we probe the relationship between the mystical intent of Christian theology and the appearance of praxis as a category derived from the Marxist lexicon, within the modus cogitans of Latin American theology of liberation. We problematise the transcendentalism that liberation theology places on social practice, in its retention of a spiritualist Weltanschauung as the preeminent framework for the critique of socio-historical reality. Far from being a materialist-transformative \u201cepistemological break\u201d from orthodox theology, this putative theology of revolution is thus exposed as being a brand of a Hegelian theosophy, which is discontinuous with the dialectical understanding of the socio-material basis of human relations that emerges around Marxist Theory, namely praxis. Our leitmotif is therefore a claim that political theology, qua theology in general, and the Latin American Theology of Liberation in particular, have a limited efficacy as a theoretical tool for socio-political transformation, due to its inherent transcendentalist and rationalistic orientation.",

Nevertheless, this paper embraces the view that each of these criteria is conceptually uncongenial to any violence, and thus Dussel gets involved in multiple contradictions as he aims, on the contrary, to justify precisely with these criteria the (legitimate) use of violence.",

Enrique Dussel, main figure of both philosophy of liberation and liberation theology, asserts that Heideggerian ontology negates the exteriority of Other. He tries to recover peripheral histories as the source of that critique. He lays out a philosophical framework that will protect the exteriority of the other, in other words, freedom of the Other. He characterizes his method as \u201canalectical\u201d or \u201canadialectical\u201d to distinguish itself from \u201cdialectical\u201d method. The \u201cana\u201d(\u201cbeyond\u201d) dialectical method orients towards the Other outside the dialectics of the ego. By pivoting from ontology to trans-ontology, he argues with Karl Otto Apel, the founder of Ethics of Communication, to establish a planetary ethics in an age of worsening and systematic exclusion of late capitalism`s globalisation. He insists that before we are members of community of communication, we are members of community of life. That`s why transcendental economics is prior to transcendental pragmatics. The incorporation of exteriorty of other in global economic and political system that liberates other is the main issue that Dussel suggests for the neoliberal world-system which is chalenged by ecological peril and asymetrical distribution of wealth.",

      "abstract": "In Prophetic Visions of the Past: Pan-Caribbean Representations of the Haitian Revolution, Vi\u0301ctor Figueroa examines how the Haitian Revolution has been represented in twentieth-century literary works from across the Caribbean. Building on the scholarship of key thinkers of the Latin American \"decolonial turn\" such as Enrique Dussel, An\u00edbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, and Nelson Maldonado-Torres, Figueroa argues that examining how Haiti's neighbors tell the story of the Revolution illuminates its role as a fundamental turning point in both the development and radical questioning of the modern/colonial world system. Prophetic Visions of the Past includes chapters on literary texts from a wide array of languages, histories, and perspectives. Figueroa addresses work by Alejo Carpentier (Cuba), C. L. R. James (Trinidad), Luis Pal\u00e9s Matos (Puerto Rico), Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire (Martinique), Derek Walcott (Saint Lucia), Edouard Glissant (Martinique), and Manuel Zapata Olivella (Colombia). While underscoring each writer's unique position, Figueroa also addresses their shared geographical, historical, and sociopolitical preoccupations, which are closely linked to the region's prolonged experience of colonial interventions. Ultimately, these analyses probe how, for the larger Caribbean region, the Haitian Revolution continues to reflect the tension between inspiring revolutionary hopes and an awareness of ongoing colonial objectification and exploitation.",

      "abstract": "Resumo Este artigo apresenta contribui\u00e7\u00f5es de J\u00fcrgen Habermas e Paulo Freire para a constitui\u00e7\u00e3o de sujeitos cr\u00edtico-reflexivos e suas implica\u00e7\u00f5es nos processos de ensino/pesquisa/extens\u00e3o no campo dos Estudos Organizacionais. Mostramos que intersubjetividade e dialogicidade s\u00e3o condi\u00e7\u00f5es para o entendimento entre sujeitos e \u00e9 justamente por meio delas que ocorre sua constitui\u00e7\u00e3o em um processo que \u00e9 dial\u00f3gico, pedag\u00f3gico e pol\u00edtico. Freire e Habermas oferecem elementos para desconstruir a l\u00f3gica instrumental dominante e fornecem bases para a reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de possibilidades in\u00e9ditas/vi\u00e1veis de formas de organizar e gerir. A partir disso, este artigo destaca a import\u00e2ncia dos Estudos Organizacionais ampliarem o foco das possibilidades de ensino/pesquisa/extens\u00e3o e direciona-os para um engajamento comunicativo e dial\u00f3gico, ultrapassando as fronteiras das universidades. Essa reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o indica aos pesquisadores que participem de diferentes arenas p\u00fablicas, do debate e da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de problemas, em processos de resist\u00eancia, da visibilidade e dramatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de quest\u00f5es problem\u00e1ticas. Nos caminhos de Freire e Habermas, os Estudos Organizacionais n\u00e3o podem apenas desenvolver uma cr\u00edtica \u00e0 dist\u00e2ncia: \u00e9 preciso coparticipar, co-agir, co-operar e coconstruir com os p\u00fablicos em que se engajam.",

      "abstract": "This essay aims to extend Paul Ric\u0153ur\u2019s account of recognition to address some of the concerns of globalization, especially those voiced by Enrique Dussel. The extension is accomplished in two parts. First, Dussel\u2019s account of spatial existence as dwelling is reviewed as it is pertinent to the concerns of globalization. Next, it is demonstrated that each of the aspects of Ric\u0153ur\u2019s account of recognition may be given a spatial re-articulation. The results thus establish an outline of how recognition theory might address some of the concerns of globalization. The essay concludes with several consequences for the modification of recognition politics as one finds it in the late work of Ric\u0153ur and in Axel Honneth\u2019s ongoing inquiries.",

      "abstract": "Habermas\u2019 account of social identity is the most sophisticated among various deliberative and expansive democratic models and aligns with his long-standing theoretical commitment to communicative rationality that is tailored to the democratic organization of society. Taking a normative stance, he proposes a procedural account of social identity within communicative rationality, achievable only in modernity and deliberative democracy. We argue that his formulation of social identity is inadequate, given a problematic stage-based framework in his historical account of societal evolution and the insubstantial nature of social identity in his linguistic and procedural accounts of social identity. Nonetheless, Habermas\u2019 approach can serve as a starting point to develop a more inclusive and empirically defensible conceptual framework for collective identity, grounded in robust institutional foundations and a substantive account of the political. Finally, by challenging Habermas\u2019 separation of system and lifeworld, we argue that a rational social identity should be rooted in both domains.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to express Honneth's critique of Habermas' deliberative democracy. This research uses qualitative methods that are critically analytical in comparing the thoughts of Habermas and Honneth. The theory used is the sociology of knowledge from Karl Mannheim's. In the sociological theory of knowledge Mannheim says that man and his existence in the social environment can not be separated from his environment, a subjectivity that knows there is always interference from the social, political environment in which he lives. The results of this study reveal that the deliberative criticism of Democracy echoed by Habermas still leaves problems. The problem in deliberative democracies hints at rational communication, yet everyone does not have the same knowledge of rationality. For the educated person he has communication and knowledge rationally, but for the unlearned person does not have it, so they must represent his voice. In the Indonesian context, deliberative democracy is still wishful thinking. The public space referred to by Habermas has not yet gained a place in Indonesia, because the representation system that is the hallmark of representative democracy can be said to be pseudo-representation because there is no proportional bargaining position between constituents and their people's representatives. As Honneth's critique of Habermas the weakness of deliberative democracy, Honneth offers a form of intersubjective relation based on three areas of recognition namely love, self-confidence, self-respect, solidarity.",

It explores the congruence and contrasts between Habermas's discourse theory of democracy or deliberative democracy and Iqbal's theory of spiritual democracy. This research strives to find out the extent to which the core values of Habermas's theory and that of Iqbal\u2019s are compatible. For Habermas, the core values of social order are liberty and equality, whereas Iqbal upholds liberty, equality, and solidarity. It has been investigated whether they both mean the same phenomena by the same terms or not. For Habermas and Iqbal, democracy is the best form of government but neither one is satisfied with the existing democratic practices. In principle, they accept democracy as the best political system. The research paper also sheds light on the historical and cultural influences that have shaped the political ideologies of both Habermas and Iqbal, considering the impact of Western Enlightenment ideals on Habermas and the role of Islamic jurisprudence and spirituality in shaping Iqbal's democratic theory. Through critical analysis, this study aims to deepen the understanding of complexities inherent in the dialogue between Western and Muslim civilizations and offers insights into potential avenues for collaboration in political theory and practice.",

Using a critical-hermeneutic approach, the study analyzes the concept of communicative rationality, which emphasizes the importance of equal dialogue, and discursive ethics, which demands inclusivity in decisionmaking processes. Case studies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, climate change through the UNFCCC, and the Alliance of Civilizations initiative demonstrate how Habermas' theory can be implemented to createinclusive and solution-oriented dialogue. The main findings reveal that power imbalances and cultural biases often hinder the creation of a genuine global public sphere. However, applying Habermas' theory can address these challenges through community-based deliberative mechanisms, cross-cultural education, and digital technologies. The paper recommends strengthening international institutions, utilizing social media as a deliberative space, and developing education rooted in local cultures. Thus, Habermas' theory proves to be relevant as both a philosophical and practical foundation for building global peace.Nevertheless, its successful implementation requires adaptation to contemporary challenges, such as disinformation and the dominance of powerful actors in international relations.",

Using a conceptual\u2013analytical qualitative approach, it analyzes how algorithmic systems regulate social action by subordinating subjects to calculation, prediction, and efficiency. The study shows that the algorithmization of social life reduces human experience to units of datafication that can be predicted and modified, thereby deepening forms of technical domination. At the same time, algorithmically mediated digital public spheres are shaped more by platform commercial logics than by dialogic and deliberative norms, undermining conditions for democratic communication. By synthesizing Horkheimer and Habermas, the article proposes a conceptual framework for understanding contemporary forms of domination across technical and communicative domains and argues for the development of critical ethical\u2013normative frameworks and the reconstruction of digital public spaces that support communication free from domination.",

After recalling Habermas\u2019s views on the public sphere, I present and discuss various objections raised by other critical theorists: Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nancy Fraser, Axel Honneth and Iris Marion Young. These criticisms insist on the paradoxically excluding effects of a conception of democracy that promotes civic participation in the public debate. Negt, Kluge and Fraser develop a Marxist line of analysis that question who can participate in the public sphere. Honneth and Young criticize in various ways the excluding effect of argumentation: are unargumentative speeches excluded from the public debate? I show how Habermas\u2019s model can provide some responses to these various objections by drawing inspiration from his treatment of the gap between religious and post-metaphysical world views.",

Consideration of all the models demonstrates that, firstly, different thinkers understand the goals and meaning of deliberation in different ways, seeing it as either epistemic or non-epistemic value, and secondly, deliberation itself can be understood in two ways, namely as a discussion and as an reflection (thoughtfulness), which allows to talk about the existence of actually two different theories of deliberative democracy: discursive and reflexive.Research implications.

      "abstract": "The foundations of deliberative democracy rest on ideals of communicative rationality, as articulated by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a key representative of the Frankfurt School\u2019s second generation. Emerging from critical theory\u2019s broader critique of instrumental rationality, deliberative democracy emphasizes public discourse and consensus as essential mechanisms for legitimate governance. This model assumes that through discourse ethics, diverse societal interests can converge toward norms, transcending\npartial biases. However, in times of uncertainty \u2014 particularly during war or social upheaval \u2014 these assumptions face significant challenges. The historical context of the Frankfurt School\u2019s development underscores this point. Established amidst the European crises of the early 20th century, critical theorists like Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer grappled with the failures of rationality that led to totalitarianism. The critique of deliberative democracy in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war highlights\nthe need to reassess the theory\u2019s practical and ethical foundations. While deliberative democracy aspires to foster inclusivity and legitimacy through rational discourse, its application during periods of profound uncertainty exposes critical vulnerabilities. These include the challenges of relativism, asymmetrical power dynamics, and the ethical risks of procedural neutrality. The aim of this study is to probe the practical applicability\nand evaluate the core epistemological and ethical assumptions of deliberative democracy, particularly its Habermasian formulations, when confronted with conditions of uncertainty. It critically examines the theoretical underpinnings of deliberative democracy, its limitations, and the ethical dilemmas posed by its procedural inclusivity. Methodological approach taken in this article builds upon case study to illustrate the limitations of deliberative democracy, and draws on critical theory \u2014 especially\nthose of Theodor Adorno and J\u00fcrgen Habermas \u2014 to evaluate its epistemological and ethical assumptions.",

      "abstract": "In this article Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics is critically interpreted. The article starts with a brief intellectual biography of Habermas (section 1), showing that his life and work has always had a strong ethical and political dimension \u2013 leading to the concept of discourse ethics. Next, it is indicated how Habermas\u2019s work in the 1970s culminated via four steps in his major philosophical work \u2013 the\u00a0Theory of Communicative Action\u00a0(section 2) published in 1981. In the next two sections Habermas\u00a0Theory of Communicative Action\u00a0is applied to ethics and morality in the form of his discourse ethics \u2013 the heart of this contribution (section 3). In this process the following four aspects of Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics are discussed: Its qualified Kantian deontological dimension, as well as its universalist, cognitivist, and formalist dimensions. In the following section (4) the discussion of discourse ethics is shifted to Habermas\u2019s theory of law, deliberative politics, and democracy which is a further application of ideas developed in his\u00a0Theory of Communicative Action. The contribution then ends with some critical remarks on Habermas discourse ethics and sketch of law and politics (section 5) Three arguments are presented in this regard. First, Habermas argument is judged to be too closely related to abstract rationality. Secondly the distinction that Habermas makes between morality and ethics is critically investigated. Finally, the Habermasian use of justification in his argument is critically compared with the concept of application. These points of criticism, though, indicate that the debate on Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics is ongoing.Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications:\u00a0This article deals with the concept of discourse ethics (in the Kantian tradition of ethics) as developed firstly by Karel Otto Apel and later refined by Jurgen Habermas for his own purposes. The line of argumentation developed here has significant relevance for philosophy, moral theory, law, and theology. Discourse ethics can be considered as a contemporary version of Kantian deontological ethics after the linguistic turn.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Examining recent developments in deliberative democracy alongside growing attention to system-wide racism, I look at the ways deliberative systems theory and practice deals with the tension between the theory's normative claims and the structural injustice against which deliberative systems unfold. I focus on work aimed at deepening inclusion in deliberative systems, noting that this focus on inclusion into unjust systems stops the deliberative literature from taking full responsibility for structural and systemic racism. Taking a critical approach to the deliberative literature's capacity to confront systemic racism and live up to its normative principles of treating all people as equals, I argue that we need to reframe power to centre the relationship between race and democracy. As I do so, I propose ways to begin dismantling foundational injustice in deliberative systems, centring foundational inequalities in deliberative theory and design, and setting out differential responsibilities for listening as deliberative theorists confront the problem of white supremacy in deliberative systems.",

The contributors use ideas from critical theorists including Adorno, Fromm, Marcuse and Habermas and connect them with contemporary theories and debates in educational leadership from moral education to critical theories on race, to culturally relevant practice.\n The book challenges the misconceptions of many present-day educators about the analytical lens offered by the Frankfurt School theorists which is often dismissed by policymakers and practitioners. Written by leading scholars based in the UK, USA, and Canada, the contributors emphasize and explain the importance of educational aesthetics, dialectics, education and civilization, the structural transformation of education\u2019s place in the public sphere, and education as revolution and enlightenment.",

      "abstract": "According to J\u00fcrgen Habermas, one of the leading figures in the conceptualization of the public sphere and public opinion, the public sphere must be considered as an arena that allows citizens to freely express, discuss, criticize and, eventually, publish their opinions on common topics. According to some new media theorists, such a sphere is being re-created within the age of new information technologies. The Internet\u2019s contribution to public opinion and organization of social movements is also attributed to the development of deliberative democracy, changing the perception that citizens can participate in political processes only during elections. In this sense, the Internet can become a new impetus for democratization of societies and formation of a participatory culture, providing equal opportunities to all people, including members of diverse minority groups excluded from the public sphere in the era of traditional media. Supporters of this thesis are trying to adapt the concept of the public sphere by J. Habermas to the modern digital world. In other words, for them, the Internet-cafe of the 21st century plays the role of coffeehouses and salons of the 18th\u201119th centuries. Those who analyze the new media from a critical perspective, on the contrary, see the Internet as a great machine that can be used to control and manipulate citizens. Approaching the issue from a completely different perspective, they note that new information technologies lead to capitalist exploitation and corporate control, on the one hand, and to the dissemination of false information and interference in the private life of citizens, on the other. In the field of economics, the concepts of \u201cdigital capitalism\u201d, \u201ccybercapitalism\u201d, \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d, and \u201cwikinomics\u201d are already widely used, implying the commodification of virtual data, which ultimately results in a huge \u201cpersonal data market\u201d. This study aims to compare the aforementioned perspectives and answer the question of whether the Internet can contribute to the formation of a free public sphere separate from the political sphere.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: This article attempts to reconstruct and analyse the Habermas\u2019 view on democracy as discourse and deliberation. The concept of deliberative and discursive democracy is a model of criticism toward an attempt to narrow the conception about democracy simply as an institutional matter. The concept of deliberative democracy emphasizes the importance of public discursive participation of citizens by establishing critical public sphere that is the heart of democracy. Furthermore, Habermas highlights that there is no rule of law without radical democracy. Such radical democracy is expressed through the active involvement of citizens in public sphere to express ideas that have impact on political decisions and public policy. This article accentuates that the transformation of public opinion to be a political power is an ongoing process. Therefore, an authentic democracy presupposes a critical publicity and democratic political culture. Without a voluntary citizens\u2019 initiative in this regard, a state will have no future. To support thisarguments, the writer uses literature research method by analyzing the main work of J\u0215rgen Habermas on deliberative democracy namely Faktizit\u04d3t und Geltung (Facts and Norms), as well as some secondary literatures dealing with the thoughts of Habermas on democracy.Keywords: Habermas, deliberative democracy, discourse, pluralism, state",

The first section analyzes the constitutive lacuna and exception, the fundamental dilemma in political ontology that impede the realization of practical universal consensus due to the enduring and irreconcilable political conflicts embedded in democratic conditions and contexts. The second section delves into the fallacy of universal consensus and its psychoanalytic significance, illuminating how Lacanian notion of fantasy constructs illusory plenitude, manipulates causality, and validates the substantive pursuit of elusive substance. Drawing upon Immanuel Kant\u2019s notion of aesthetic consensus and common sense, which posit an imaginary common consensus shaped by affective reactions, the following section serves to examine an intersection between Kantian aesthetics and the conceptual and practical aporias of Habermas\u2019s philosophical and political notion. Lastly, this essay concludes by suggesting affective hegemony as a new framework for comprehending the intricate dynamics of modern affective politics.",

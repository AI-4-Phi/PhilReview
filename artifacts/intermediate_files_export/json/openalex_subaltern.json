      "abstract": "Many barriers to realizing a vision of inclusive and deliberative democracy exist. But even in stratified societies, one can find relatively safe discursive arenas within schools where members of subordinated groups can explore who they are and want to become and can prepare to voice their needs, concerns, and issues in wider public realms. Nancy Fraser (1997) conceptualizes such arenas as \u201csubaltern counterpublics\u201d capable of expanding our \u201cactually existing democracy.\u201d Drawing on ethnographic data, this article analyzes the Teenage Parents Program as a feminist counterpublic within a Canadian public high school. It argues that youths need to learn to recognize the power of dominant as well as alternative or oppositional discourses and to articulate and strategically pursue their needs and interests.",

      "abstract": "In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, J\u00fcrgen Habermas documented the historical emergence and fall of what he called the bourgeois public sphere, which he defined as \u201c[a] sphere of private people come together as a public . . . to engage [public authorities] in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor.\u201d This was a space where individuals gathered to discuss with each other, and sometimes with public officials, matters of shared concern. The aim of these gatherings was not simply discourse; these gatherings allowed the bourgeoisie to use their reason to determine the boundaries of public and private and to self-consciously develop the public sphere. As Habermas writes, \u201c[t]he medium of this political confrontation was . . . people\u2019s public use of their reason.\u201d The bourgeois public didn\u2019t simply participate, but it did so both directly and critically. The development of the bourgeois public as a critical, intellectual public took place in coffeehouses, in salons, and table societies. In Great Britain, Germany, and France, particularly, the coffeehouses and the salons \u201cwere centers of criticism\u2014literary at first, then also political\u2014in which began to emerge, between aristocratic society and bourgeois intellectuals, a certain parity of the educated.\u201d Intellectual equals came together and deliberated, an equality that was key in ensuring the requisite openness and deliberation. No one person dominated the discussion due to his status within the deliberative community. Instead, and above all else, the \u201cpower of the better argument\u201d won out. Two conditions were critical to these deliberations. First, equality was key to the public sphere. Membership in the public sphere meant that no one person was above the other and all arguments were similarly treated and scrutinized. Second, the principle of universal access was crucial.8The doors of the deliberative space were open to all comers and no group or person was purposefully shut out. Seen together, these two conditions provide a blueprint for deliberative practices in a democratic society.",

In examining the work carried out by the Aymara nongovernmental organization known as the Taller de Historia Oral Andina (THOA), the essay highlights this sphere's importance as both a discursive and territorial arena where agency is expressed in the collaborative spirit of community. THOA's work is significant in strategically formulating a methodology of decolonization based on revisionist Andean historiography, territorial demands, and collective political action.",

This article attempts to shift the emphasis away from PRA's practice towards its theoretical underpinnings. The article argues that PRA's practice/ empiricist orientation causes it to be insufficiently theorised and politicised. As a result, questions about inclusiveness, the role of PRA facilitators, and the personal behaviour of elites overshadow, or sometimes ignore, questions of legitimacy, justice, power and the politics of gender and difference. The article draws on arguments and debates involving Habermasian 'deliberative democracy' and post- structuralist notions of power.",

      "abstract": "While literature examining the significance of age and generation in transnational social movements continues to grow, few studies focus specifically on young women and their involvement with global feminism. Making the empirical observation that \u201cyoung women\u201fs\u201d transnational feminist networks have emerged and gained more visibility in the last decade, this dissertation investigates their existence, asking why young women identifying as part of a \u201ctransnational feminist class\u201d form youth-only networks rather than joining \u2013 or maintaining membership within \u2013 existing and established networks. Data was collected from five young women\u201fs transnational feminist networks using qualitative methods, including semi-structured interview, participant observation and triangulated digital writing analysis. Analysis of this data yielded several findings. First, young women are likely to form \u201cyouth-only\u201d feminist networks in three circumstances: 1) when they feel under- and misrepresented within the discursive and political forums of global feminism; 2) when they feel the education they need to further their goals and establish their identities as activists is inadequate; and 3) when they find generation gaps create perceived irreconcilable \u201cdifferences\u201d of tactical and organizational preference between older and younger activists. Second, young feminists foreground age as an identity marker quite consciously in order to supersede other \u201cdifferences\u201d historically dividing transnational women\u201fs organizing, such as those of nationality, religion, sexuality and social class. These patterns suggest young women are deploying \u201cessentialist\u201d and collective movement identities strategically, and thus construct a praxis reflective of established but contentious feminist theoretical discussions such as Gayatri Spivak\u201fs \u201cstrategic essentialism\u201d (1990), Nancy Fraser\u201fs \u201csubaltern counterpublic\u201d(1990) and Rita Felski\u201fs \u201cself-consciously oppositional identity\u201d (1989) . The three main chapters of this dissertation examine 1) the creation and articulation of a \u201cyoung transnational feminist\u201d counterpublic sphere; 2) the discourse of \u201cdifference\u201d permeating young women\u201fs transnational feminist networks; and 3) the effort to construct more \u201cdemocratic\u201d, \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cself-directed\u201d educational programs for young feminist activists. I conclude with the observation that young activist women within the transnational feminist movement draw on but re-conceptualize existing theories of globalization, social movements and transnational feminist activism, and offer suggestions for the ways in which scholars might be more inclusive of young women\u201fs practices and preferences in future studies of transnational activism.",

To do this we provide an in-depth genealogy of the concept of counterpublics, analyze its use by critical scholars, and then consider its application in empirical studies of digital networks and right-wing publics. We argue that scholars studying digital and far-right publics in particular must take the critical analysis of power seriously. Through this lens, we show that classifying right-wing movements as \u201cdefensive\u201d is more theoretically and empirically accurate. In doing so, we conceptualize public spheres as indelible outgrowths of social structures, even as they work to transform them in turn, and provide a framework for scholars to understand public spheres through the lens of history, social differentiation, relations, resources, and access.",

Background assumptions and ideologies about media technologies and their functioning also require more comparative analysis, as they impact public spheres and claims to authority and authenticity that ultimately produce and shape scenarios of ethnic and religious diversity. This additional dimension of diversity in the question of media and ethnic and religious pluralism is particularly apparent in crises of political and religious mediation. The latter often result in desires to bypass established forms of political and religious mediation that are in turn often projected on new media technologies.",

      "abstract": "In April 2022, Barack Obama was invited by Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center to deliver a keynote address on the \u201cChallenges to Democracy in the Digital Information Realm.\u201d The former US president made the trip to the \u201cheart of the Silicon Valley,\u201d as he put it, to issue a stern warning: social media are \u201cone of the biggest reasons for democracies weakening\u201d (Obama 2022). Coming from someone widely recognized to have employed digital technology to great effect in his presidential campaigns (Cogburn and Espinoza-Vasquez 2011; Harfoush 2009), this statement echoes a broader disenchantment with the Internet's democratic promises. Gone are the days when the Web was seen as a panacea to democratic deficit. Only a decade ago, social and political theorists predicted that new, networked, communicative processes would improve collective decision-making, challenge the top-down logic of mass media, and provide activists with means to resist excessive state authority (Castells 2013; Shirky 2009). Today, social media are most often associated with misinformation, the rise of populism, polarization, and democratic decay (Bimber and Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2020; Boulianne et al. 2020; McKay and Tenove 2021; Sunstein 2018). Underlying these debates is the question of digital technology's impact on politics. Like newspapers two centuries ago or broadcast media in the past century,1 social media have altered the functioning of representative democracies in manifold ways. At the empirical level, extensive research has explored whether they favor the creation of \u201cecho chambers\u201d (Barber\u00e1 2020; Dubois and Blank 2018; Garrett 2009), whether they amplify radical content (Halpern and Gibbs 2013; Husz\u00e1r et al. 2021), or whether increased social media use induces polarization (Bail 2021; Boxell et al. 2017; Dubois and Blank 2018; Yardi and Boyd 2010). For their part, political theorists have overwhelmingly attempted to make sense of the impact of digital technology on democracy with reference to J\u00fcrgen Habermas's work on the public sphere (Chambers and Gastil 2021; Dahlgren 2005; Dean 2003; Dommett and Verov\u0161ek 2021; Fuchs 2014; McKay and Tenove 2021; Sevignani 2022). This should not come as a surprise since Habermas was the first to comprehensively theorize the importance of the public sphere to democracy and dedicated considerable attention to the constitutive role of media in structuring it (Habermas 2015). However, the substantial evolution of his theories over four decades and his later contributions to the deliberative tradition of democratic thought have also muddied the waters and led many theorists to conflate the public sphere with deliberative democracy. The tendency has as a result been to measure\u2014even if sometimes only implicitly\u2014social media practices against deliberative norms (Chambers and Gastil 2021; Dahlgren 2001; Dean 2003; Papacharissi 2002; Rosa 2022), foreclosing the possibilities generated by the more open use of the concept of the public sphere that had been prevalent in political theory until the turn of the 21st century. I argue in this article that recovering such definition sheds new light on social media's impact on the public sphere by pointing to the role of digital technology in altering the balance of power between the liberal, bourgeois public sphere portrayed in Habermas's Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere and its oppositional nemesis, called \u201cplebeian\u201d by Habermas in the work's preface (Habermas 2015, xviii) or \u201cproletarian\u201d by some of his German critics such as Alexandre Kluge and Oskar Negt (Negt and Kluge 2016). Drawing on their insights but justifying a conscious departure from their terminology, I submit that we might have good reason to see social media as having bolstered the \u201cpopular public sphere,\u201d at once deeply enmeshed in consumerist logics but also the bearer of an emancipatory promise that remains unfulfilled in the current media environment. My aims in doing such work are twofold.

Current hegemonic practices and projects make common sense of a market-driven politics and a fragmented culture, infusing into them an organization of consent that operates both locally and globally. Yet this amounts only to a thin hegemony, a weak and ecologically unsustainable basis for social cohesion and material reproduction. If contemporary hegemony is deeply yet perilously grounded then counter-hegemony needs to address those grounds. This stricture points to the articulation of various subaltern and progressive-democratic currents into a counter-hegemonic bloc that organizes dissent across space and time. Counter-hegemony needs to walk on both legs, taking up statecentred issues as well as issues resident in national and transnational civil societies. Its durability across conjunctures requires not only a shared ethical vision but a political form appropriate to its tasks. A range of recent developments relevant to these issues is discussed. The article concludes with a critique of the anti-hegemonic politics of dispersed singularities, whose insights, particularly on the value of direct action and prefiguration, need to be integrated into a strategically coherent form.",

I argue that digital space is, like any other form of media, structured essentially by racism and patriarchy, but I also note the crucial potential for resistance exhibited by Muslim activists such as political leaders Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, Instagram influencer Ayesha Malik, and the largely anonymous women who participated in #MosqueMeToo, encouraged by the journalist and activist Mona Eltahawy. I draw upon a post/anti-colonial feminist framework and the tools of critical discourse analysis in examining specific instances where such women perform acts of resistance that, in turn, trigger a gendered and raced reaction. I note the ways in which some Muslim women, such as Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed, are constructed as media heroes, given that their stories can be co-opted to validate notions of the white colonial savior, while others directly challenge narratives of colonialism and oppression and are thus subjected to backlash. I point to the ways in which some of this vitriol continues to refer back to the notion that Muslim women should be silent, and to the fetishized Muslim woman's body: how it should look, where it can/should go, and what can be done to it.",

More specifically, the study aims to demonstrate that, whilst Habermas\u2019s approach succeeds in offering useful insights into the structural transformation of the public sphere in the early modern period, it does not provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding the structural transformation of public spheres in late modern societies. To the extent that the gradual differentiation of social life manifests itself in the proliferation of multiple public spheres, a critical theory of public normativity needs to confront the challenges posed by the material and ideological complexity of late modernity in order to account for the polycentric nature of advanced societies. With the aim of showing this, the paper is divided into three sections. The first section elucidates the sociological meaning of the public/private dichotomy. The second section scrutinizes the key features of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere by reflecting on (i) the concept of the public sphere, (ii) the normative specificity of the bourgeois public sphere, and (iii) the structural transformation of the public sphere in modern society. The third section explores the most substantial shortcomings of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere, particularly its inability to explain the historical emergence and political function of differentiated public spheres in advanced societies.",

We focus on one such group, Muslim Americans, and ask how visible Muslim Americans, such as journalists, activists, and aspiring politicians, use social media to craft counter-narratives, reclaim control of their stories, and mitigate the harm directed at them. Through a series of 19 interviews, we found that visible Muslim Americans' ability to craft and sustain counter narratives is largely hampered by sustained online harm (e.g. harassment). We found that these public figures were harmed repeatedly over long periods of time and through the weaponization of platform affordances such as replying, tagging, and hashtag takeovers, as well as the weaponization of their gender and identity. Our findings shed light on the serious limitations of social media to provide a safe platform for counterpublics to engage externally with wider publics. Finally, we discuss the limitations of content moderation as the dominant framework for addressing harm online and suggest alternative paths forward based on restorative and transformative justice.",

Apart from their topical import, these groups provide a unique entrance to grassroots discourses of the radical right movement and the mechanisms for radical nationalist mobilization. In this paper, we present an analysis of the largest current anti-immigrant online discussion group in Sweden by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. We argue that this type of social media group needs to be approached as both a \u201ccounterpublic\u201d within a wider public sphere and as a \u201cfree social space\u201d for social movements. The analysis reveals that the use of external links in the group reflects an active negotiation of frames that both confirm and contradict those of the group, thereby challenging a simplistic understanding of the so-called \u201cecho chamber\u201d dynamics. A form of collective identity can be discerned, mainly through the opposition to various outgroups and through an implicit form of nationalism expressed through the concern of \u201csacred objects\u201d typically perceived to be under threat.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Networked online environments can effectively support political activism. In Sweden, the #metoo movement resulted in over 100,000 people participating in activities challenging sexual harassment and abuse, including collecting testimonies via social media and drafting and discussing petitions published in print news media. Participation involved many risks, such as social stigma, losing one\u2019s job, or misogynist terrorism, which meant that participation required a high level of trust among peers. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research on trust generally focuses on technical systems or user-generated data, less focus has been given to trust among peers in vulnerable communities. This study, based on semi-structured interviews and surveys of participants and organizers of 47 petitions representing different sectors in society, found that trust was aggregated over networks of people, practices, institutions, shared values, and technical systems. Although a supportive culture based on a feeling of solidarity and shared feminist values was central for safe spaces for participation, when activism was scaled up, social interaction had to be limited due to increased risk. HCI research views trust as a process of crossing distances, increasing over time; however, our results reveal that trust decreased over time as the movement grew and public exposure increased, a trend most evident when the participants actually came from a tightly knit community. Therefore, this study points out the significance to balance the need for transparency and community with the need for anonymity and distance in the development of tools to support large-scale deliberative processes that involve conflicts and risks.",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on the uproar over the sexual encounter between actor/comedian Aziz Ansari and a woman known publicly as Grace as a lens onto the colorblind counterpublic feminisms driving the #MeToo movement. Tracing the ways that this sexual encounter between a Brown Muslim man and an anonymous, presumably white, woman were spotlighted, we show that race is superficially absent even as it informs the range of feminist counterpublics that emerged around this case. Extending feminist theories of counter/publics, we explore the ways that the hybrid media system, including traditional as well as digital media, enables colorblind feminisms. Focusing on Facebook as an index of these plural feminist perspectives, we examine eighty-four of the most shared links on this platform to show that, regardless of the positions taken, issues of gender and sexuality dominate framings of the Ansari-Grace encounter, even as race and racialization implicitly mediate the public conversations on heterosexual violence and misconduct. Situating these conversations within the broader history of US racisms and the politics of sexual assault, we also point to how mediated technologies are contributing to the hypervisibility of men of color and shaping which cases occupy the limelight and the feminist counterpublics emerging around them. We argue that these colorblind feminist counterpublics, in effect, center the pain of white women.",

      "abstract": "A structural transformation of the public sphere in contemporary Aceh is marked by the monopoly over religious interpretations by the state and ulema through the enactment of Islamic sharia. This article examines the performance of Aceh\u2019s public sphere with reference to non-Muslim discourses in practising Islamic politics. The data were collected through observations, in-depth interviews, and literature study. Based on the concept of multiple public spheres, this paper argues that the government\u2019s attempts to restrict the performance of public space based on Islamic values and identities is not only unsuccessful but also triggers a counter-public sphere to emerge. The counterpublic sphere has become an arena where its proponents promote their valuable ideas, negotiate identity, or being resistant to in realising aspirations. This study finds out that the visibility of public space is in layers and there may be no connections between one contingent and another, or they even contest. Although they may have similarities in being resistant to dominant narratives, the proponents of public space have many ways, perspectives, or strategies to share their ideas and increase their participation in the more prominent public space.",

      "abstract": "This essay attempts to elaborate a notion of \u2018public domain\u2019 in order to capture the elusive features of \u2018public-ness\u2019. Its leading question can thus be put as follows: \u2018what is specifically public in public situations and public spaces? What is the specific dynamic that contradistinguishes the public?\u2019 A series of empirical cases taken from different contexts, which functions as thought-provoking illustration of the theoretical issues at stakes, is discussed. Theoretically, the essay draws from, and suggests a critical synthesis of, four major threads of research: political and social philosophy (notion of \u2018public sphere\u2019), interaction sociology and cultural studies (notion of \u2018public realm\u2019), urban studies (notion of \u2018public space\u2019) and the literature on governance and policing (notion of \u2018public order\u2019). Accordingly, the public domain is conceptualised as an ecology of three ecologies; in other words, it is regarded as composed of a media ecology (or, an ecology of mediations), an urban ecology and an ecology of attentions. An evental perspective on the public domain is proposed, which takes into account the convergences and the tensions that exist within the social between material and immaterial dimensions. From this perspective, the public domain is inherently defined by the events of visibility, accessibility, circulation, appropriation and resistance.",

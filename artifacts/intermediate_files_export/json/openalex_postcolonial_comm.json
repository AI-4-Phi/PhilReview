      "abstract": "abstract Scholars in management and economics widely share the assumption that business firms focus on profits only, while it is the task of the state system to provide public goods. In this view business firms are conceived of as economic actors, and governments and their state agencies are considered the only political actors. We suggest that, under the conditions of globalization, the strict division of labour between private business and nation\u2010state governance does not hold any more. Many business firms have started to assume social and political responsibilities that go beyond legal requirements and fill the regulatory vacuum in global governance. Our review of the literature shows that there are a growing number of publications from various disciplines that propose a politicized concept of corporate social responsibility. We consider the implications of this new perspective for theorizing about the business firm, governance, and democracy.",

      "abstract": "Feminist theorizing in the past decade has taken up the strenuous questioning of the usefulness of the theoretical concepts elaborated within postcolonial theory for the explanation of the postsocialist experience (Suchland 2011, Tlostanova 2010, 2012). The present chapter seeks to look at how feminists in both geopolitical locations have engaged with pervasive neoliberalism that threatens to coopt feminist resistance. Neoliberalism is important not just as a form of economic organization but as a rationality, especially in the context of contemporary communicative capitalism (Dean 2007, Brown 2015). The present chapter proceeds from an understanding that, among other things, neoliberalism relies on a transparency without a public (Queiros 2017), which has serious implications for political activism. Thus, the chapter asks whether the critical strategy of opacity, developed within postcolonial theory (Glissant 1990, Bhabha 1985) and now extended to the present economic and political reality, can be applied in feminist responses to neoliberalism in the postsocialist world. The strategies developed in the postsocialist context where neoliberal rationality has been a dominant public discourse in the past twenty years has the potential to re-invigorate the concept of opacity also for postcolonial activism.",

      "abstract": "The utilization of urban planning practices for political purposes has become an issue of planning theory in the last decades. Until the 1970s town planning was considered to be a neutral and rational instrument for the purpose of spatial regulation and administration as well as the general improvement of living conditions. Only recently with the rise of communicative planning theory this perspective has been complemented by critical perceptions of the political and ideological role of planning practices within society, their context-dependence, legitimization, normative purposes and also its interlinkages to individual aims as well as political and economic power. Jerusalem, the (partly occupied) capital of Israel, is a prototypic example of the utilization of urban planning for (even geo) political ends. This article is based on qualitative fieldwork and aims to scrutinize the scalar political consequences of various urban planning practices in Jerusalem. We undertake an analysis of the reciprocal relations of local, national, and geostrategic interests as well as the resulting actions by the relevant stakeholders. Theoretically informed by postcolonial geographies and performative approaches the paper concludes, that urban planning in Jerusalem is a highly political instrument that is strongly involved in the performative implementations of particular geographic imaginations of Jerusalem as a united capital of the state of Israel and historic as well as religious symbol of the Jewish nation. Hence urban planning in Jerusalem is an active element in the enforcement of hegemonic political interests which reach beyond the local context of Eastern Jerusalem.",

It calls for a de-Westernization of critical data studies, in view of promoting a reparation to the cognitive injustice that fails to recognize non-mainstream ways of knowing the world through data. It situates the \u201cBig Data from the South\u201d research agenda as an epistemological, ontological, and ethical program and outlines five conceptual operations to shape this agenda. First, it suggests moving past the \u201cuniversalism\u201d associated with our interpretations of datafication. Second, it advocates understanding the South as a composite and plural entity, beyond the geographical connotation (i.e., \u201cglobal South\u201d). Third, it postulates a critical engagement with the decolonial approach. Fourth, it argues for the need to bring agency to the core of our analyses. Finally, it suggests embracing the imaginaries of datafication emerging from the Souths, foregrounding empowering ways of thinking data from the margins.",

In the case of the media sphere, the present-day media conjuncture is now considered to be the most participatory ever, but media participation has had a long and intense history. To deal with these paradoxes, this book looks at participation as a structurally unstable concept and as the object of a political-ideological struggle that makes it oscillate between minimalist and maximalist versions. This struggle is analysed in theoretical reflections in five fields (democracy, arts, development, spatial planning and media) and in eight different cases of media practice. These case studies also show participation\u2019s close connection to power, identity, organization, technology and quality.",

We start with a definition of PCSR, focusing on firms\u2019 contribution to public goods. We then discuss historical antecedents to the debate and outline the original economic and political context. The following section explores emerging changes in the institutional context relevant to PCSR and reconsiders some of the assumptions underlying Habermas\u2019 thesis of the postnational constellation. This highlights some neglected issues in previous works on PCSR, including the influence of nationalism and fundamentalism, the role of various types of business organisations, the return of government regulation, the complexity of institutional contexts, the efficiency of private governance, the financialization and digitalization of the economy, and the relevance of managerial sensemaking. Finally, we discuss the contributions to this special issue and relate them to the newly emerging research agenda.",

      "abstract": "Why do rulers employ ethnic exclusion at the risk of civil war? Focusing on the region of sub-Saharan Africa, the author attributes this costly strategy to the commitment problem that arises in personalist regimes between elites who hold joint control of the state's coercive apparatus. As no faction can be sure that others will not exploit their violent capabilities to usurp power, elites maneuver to protect their privileged position and safeguard against others' first-a rising internal threat, rulers move to eliminate their rivals to guarantee their personal and political survival. But the cost of such a strategy, especially when carried out along ethnic lines, is that it increases the risk of a future civil war. To test this argument, the author employs the Ethnic Power Relations data set combined with original data on the ethnicity of conspirators of coups and rebellions in Africa. He finds that in Africa ethnic exclusion substitutes civil war risk for coup risk. And rulers are significantly more likely to exclude their coconspirators \u2014the very friends and allies who helped them come to power\u2014than other included groups, but at the cost of increasing the risk of a future civil war with their former allies. In the first three years after being purged from the central government, coconspirators and their coethnics are sixteen times more likely to rebel than when they were represented at the apex of the regime.",

      "abstract": "Planning theory has shifted over time in response to changes in broader social and philosophical theory as well as changes in the material world. Postmodernism and poststructuralism dislodged modernist, rational and technical approaches to planning. Consensualist decision-making theories of the 1980s took forms of communicative and collaborative planning, drawing on Habermasian concepts of power and society. These positions, along with refinements and critiques within the field, have been hegemonic in planning theory ever since. They are, in most cases, presented at a high level of abstraction, make little reference to the political and social contexts in which they are based, and hold an unspoken assumption that they are of universal value, i.e. valid everywhere. Not only does this suggest important research methodology errors but it also renders these theories of little use in those parts of the world which are contextually very different from theory origin\u2014in most cases, the global North. A more recent \u2018southern turn\u2019 across a range of social science disciplines, and in planning theory, suggests the possibility of a foundational shift toward theories which acknowledge their situatedness in time and place, and which recognize that extensive global difference in cities and regions renders universalized theorising and narrow conceptual models (especially in planning theory, given its relevance for practice) as invalid. New southern theorising in planning is drawing on a range of ideas on societal conflict, informality, identity and ethnicity. Postcolonialism and coloniality have provided a useful frame for situating places historically and geographically in relation to the rest of the world. However, the newness of these explorations still warrants the labelling of this shift as a \u2018southern theorizing project\u2019 in planning rather than a suggestion that southern planning theory has emerged.",

We know scale by many names and through many familiar antinomies: local and global, micro and macro events. Even the most critical among us often proceed with our analysis as if such scales were the ready-made platforms of social life, rather than asking how, why, and to what effect are scalar distinctions forged in the first place. How do scalar distinctions help actors and analysts alike make sense of and navigate their social worlds? What do these distinctions reveal and what do they conceal? How are scales construed and what effects do they have on the way those who abide by them think and act? This pathbreaking volume attends to the practical labor of scale-making and the communicative practices this labor requires. From an ethnographic perspective, the authors demonstrate that scale is practice and process before it becomes product, whether in the work of projecting the commons, claiming access to the big picture, or scaling the seriousness of a crime. \u201cHow shall we fathom the world, bringing its varied scales into analytic perspective?

      "abstract": "Amy11 In writing this paper, I have profited a lot from the comments and questions of the participants of the Workshop \"The Concept of Progress\" at Bremen University. Special thanks go to Amy Allen, Kristina Lepold, Daniel Loick, Frank Nullmeier, Martin Nonhoff and Eva von Redecker. I also thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments. Allen's book The End of Progress: Decolonizing the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory (Allen, 2016, hereafter EP) has been widely read, discussed, and criticized.22 Just the tip of the iceberg: Jay (2019); Sharpe (2019); Azmanova et al. (2018); Frumer (2017); Kramer (2017); Leeb, Nichols, Winter, and Allen (2018); Sheth (2017); Telios (2017); Hedrick (2016). Her harsh verdict on contemporary Frankfurt School critical theory, which animates the debate, is all the more devastating because it is based neither on nostalgic adoration of Adorno's writings nor on over-inflated hatred of Habermas's theory, two well-known sources of severe criticisms of critical theory. On the contrary, Allen's book on the disastrous state of contemporary Frankfurt School critical theory fascinates because it is based on sympathy, even fondness, for those theories which she criticizes, especially Habermas's. Most prominent in the unfolding debate have been two strands of Allen's complex argumentation, namely her critique of founding critical theory's normativity on backward-looking progress (\"progress as a fact,\" see EP, pp. 11\u221213) and her charge of Eurocentrism against Habermas, Honneth, and Forst. This is not surprising, given that these two criticisms feature in the book's title. Yet there is a third strand in Allen's book that demonstrates her fondness of Frankfurt School critical theory, brings into view the full force of her critique, and allows us to examine and extend it one step further. This third strand is Allen's concern for an adequate conceptualization of reason's intertwinement with power, and I argue that it really is the backbone of her argumentation that organizes the other two more prominent strands. On my interpretation, Allen returns us to the core of the discontinued yet unfinished debate of the 1980s and early 1990s about the relationship between normativity and facticity, reason and power, critique and its normative foundations.33 These are related but not equivalent formulations, which designate not one issue but allude to several distinctive ways in which we can understand what the debate was about\u2014for this understanding was contested throughout the debate itself. In her readings of Habermas, Honneth, and Forst, she uses the critique of \"progress as a fact\" and of Eurocentrism in order to demonstrate that their accounts of reason's intertwinement with power are too idealistic for critical theory (Section 2). However, I argue that the criteria for an adequate conceptualization, ingeniously worked out by Allen in her combined reading of Adorno and Foucault, are not met by her own proposal. She relies on Anthony Laden's account of reasoning as a social practice but limits its conceptual status by contextualism on the metanormative level. Yet both Laden's account as well as Allen's distinction between normative and metanormative commitments are in tension with her criteria of essentially impure reason and radical self-reflexivity (Section 3). The reason, I suggest, is that she still starts from an articulation of the problem that is itself welded to a residual idealism. Holding fast to the criteria Allen puts forth requires us to submit to a genealogical critique the very terms in which she frames her critique\u2014specifically the concept of \"normativity\" (Section 4). What amounts to a small step from Allen's perspective would be a giant leap for critical theory towards emancipation from the clutches of idealism. what is distinctive about critical theory is its conception of the critical subject as self-consciously rooted in and shaped by the power relations in the society that she nevertheless aims self-reflexively and rationally to critique. As I see it, preserving this distinctiveness requires critical theory to hold open the central tension between power, on the one hand, and normativity and rationality, on the other hand, for to resolve it in either direction would mean collapsing into either political realism or what is now called ideal theory. (EP, p. xiii f., emphasis added) Critical theory's method is of course not chosen for its own sake but for its support of critical theory as a political project with the constitutive aim of emancipation. However, because of critical theory's method and its insistence on the inseparability of power and normativity, emancipation cannot be achieved through political utopias in the form of theoretically constructed ideal conditions that we should then implement (as normative political theory believes). Hence Allen argues that holding on to critical theory's distinctive method and its constitutive aim forces critical theory to adopt a negativistic conception of emancipation (Allen, 2015; more on that in Section 3). Despite this additional complexity, and precisely because of its distinctive method, critical theory furthers this aim better than idealism (as practiced by normative political theory) and positivism (as practiced quite dominantly in the social sciences), proponents of critical theory claim. Considering its aim, the charge that Frankfurt School critical theory has failed to take into account the work in postcolonial theory (EP, p. xiv f., 1\u22123) amounts to more than \"merely\" being Eurocentric. For how can critical theory claim to offer a perspective relevant for emancipation if it does not engage with one of the most important struggles of the 20th and 21st century? Even worse, Allen claims that critical theory cannot seriously engage with these struggles because it has gotten its distinctive method wrong: The latest generations of Frankfurt School critical theory do not offer an adequate conceptualization of the intertwinement of reason and power because they fall back into idealism\u2014they isolate reason from power by giving it a (quasi-)transcendental status. Allen's critique of progress aims to demonstrate that Habermas, Honneth, and Forst all rely on backward-looking \"progress as a fact\" to ground the normative criteria used in their critical theories and that this strategy can only work by divorcing reason from power, by idealizing reason out of history. The argument just sketched hints at the second indication that the intertwinement of reason and power is the third and central strand in Allen's book and is fully articulated in her criticisms of Habermas, Honneth, and Forst. Although advanced by looking at their reliance on \"progress as a fact,\" the criticisms target the residual idealism of these three authors when it comes to reason. Allen sees all three theorists searching for an immanent grounding of the normativity that underwrites their critical assessments of current societies while avoiding both foundationalism and relativism (EP, p. 13 f.). Habermas, she says, pursues a rational reconstruction of the capacities of competent speakers in posttraditional societies to secure the normativity of critical theory in the quasi-transcendental ideal presuppositions they must submit to in communication. In comparison, Allen takes Honneth to advance a more historicist and Forst to present a more constructivist account. Without engaging in a full-blown re-reading of Allen's interpretations, a brief summary shows that their common target is indeed the residual idealism in Habermas's, Honneth's, and Forst's accounts of reasons intertwinement with power, that is in their versions of critical theory's method. J\u00fcrgen Habermas's version of critical theory sets the stage for Allen's entire book, for it is his \"normative puzzle\" to which Allen responds: How can we develop \"a social theory concerned to validate its own critical standards\" (Habermas, 1984, p. xxxix)? Habermas's solution fails, according to her,44 As I cannot fully discuss Allen's interpretation here, let me just note that while I think Allen is right in diagnosing an unresolved tension between the universal formal pragmatics and Habermas's theory of modernity, I also believe that she underestimates quite how much Habermas relies on formal pragmatics and its claims of quasi-transcendental norms as the \"grammar\" of our social practices (in Wittgenstein's sense); see, for example, Habermas (2003). because his rational reconstruction of the weak normativity implicit in the practice of communication that binds speaker inextricably to the norms of an ideal speech situation (counterfactual but binding nonetheless) is in tension with his problematic theory of social evolution. Since Habermas rationally reconstructs the competences of speakers in so-called \"posttraditional\" societies, in which argumentation is freed from the bonds of tradition, he must presuppose a specific\u2014Eurocentric\u2014account of the social evolution of these societies. He idealizes reason as it has developed in European societies because it is this form of reason that he rationally reconstructs as providing the universal norms of communication and communicative action. Thus, reason is located in history twice, namely by being embodied in the counterfactual presuppositions competent speakers must submit to in practice and by being embodied in the \"progress\" of societies that have reached modernity. At the same time, reason is curiously divorced from history\u2014and thus from power\u2014precisely because of the two idealizations that are part and parcel of the very way in which Habermas twice locates reason in history. Axel Honneth (therefore?) weakens the idealization of reason by taking a more historicist (emphatically Hegelian) turn. Yet in order to avoid historic relativism, Honneth claims that the normative principles which we find embodied in \"our\" institutions are \"normatively superior to historically antecedent social ideals\" (Honneth, 2014, p. 5). Thus, he grounds the normativity of critical theory in a strong idea of normative \"progress as a fact\" (EP, p. 108), which leaves him open to charges of Eurocentrism. Furthermore, Honneth (2014, p. 7) uses the idea of normative progress in a surprising manner, namely to tame critique. He argues for a \"reconstructive criticism\" that identifies the \"imperfect embodiments\" of those \"universally accepted values\" that we have reconstructed from our history understood as in fact progressive. This kind of critique can be called \"ameliorative,\" as it categorically eschews criticisms of those normative ideals themselves.55 Honneth's position is actually a bit more complicated, as he distinguishes two types of normative progress in history: the incremental universalization of normative principles and normative revolutions that replace these ;principles with completely different ones; see, for example Honneth (2003, pp. 138\u2013142). For a thorough reconstruction and a nuanced critique, see Schaub (2015) and Honneth's reply (in Honneth, 2015). Honneth thus interprets historical progress as completed; instead of arguing that the appreciation of history gives us reasons to doubt our own normative ideals as universally valid because it demonstrates over and over again that former ideals never were as universally valid as they were supposed to be, he implicitly sees reason as having fully and finally emerged in history. For sure, the practices in which it is embodied must be perfected, but the principles stand fast. Thus, reason in its contemporary form is curiously idealized, for example, in Honneth's defense of the \"irreducibility of [moral; F.V.] progress\" (Honneth, 2009) and his bold claim that we have reached the \"end of history\" in the sense that today, any \"normative revolutions,\" that is changes of the normative principles instead of their institutionalizations, must be regressive.66 \"[\u2026] we should no longer call for 'revolutions' in the basic normative constitution of our societies. While we cannot rule out such fundamental changes taking place, any such revolution would have no capacity for moral progress, and hence nothing to recommend it.\" (Honneth, 2015, p. 210). Honneth's normative argument (he also has an empirical one, see Honneth, 2015, p. 209 f.) is that \"we cannot go beyond the normative framework of modern societies, as we find the discursive functioning of our Spirit [Geist], which is dependent on reciprocal agreement, reflected in that social order\" (Honneth, 2015, p. 210). In other words, reason has reached its ideal form; this form can be distinguished from power categorically, and all misdevelopments or social pathologies only show that power distorts reason. Wherever we find them intertwined, we can always neatly separate reason from power. Habermas locates idealized reason twice in history, ending up with a difficult tension between his universal pragmatics and his theory of social evolution, Allen argues. Rainer Forst (therefore?) strengthens the idealization of reason by taking a transcendental (emphatically Kantian) turn. Forst's account of the intertwinement of reason and power begins with a Kantian conception of practical reason, famously seen as the capacity for demanding and providing justifications (Forst, 2012b). Allen's reconstruction shows how Forst resolutely distinguishes the normative from the social, ending up with \"two worlds\": the realm of normativity in which practical reason resides and the realm of the social in which this practical reason must be realized in a power-infested world (EP, pp. 159\u2212161). Forst's attempt to account for the intertwinement of reason and power turns power into a normative concept (\"noumenal power\") by arguing that power is different from violence precisely because violence only acts on our physical bodies whereas power acts on the normative space of reason we inhabit (Forst, 2015). Allen criticizes that this underestimates power's constitutive dimension because Forst conceptualizes domination only as closing off the space of reason when in fact we also need to account for domination as \"rule through the constitution of the space of reason\" (EP, p. 150). The basic problem that hinders Forst from doing so is, according to Allen, that he not only splits the normative from the social world, but also the constructive part of critical theory from its critical part. The constructive (philosophical) part is a theory of justice based on Forst's account of practical reason as the capacity for justification; the critical (empirical) part is the analysis and critique of our contemporary world in light of the norms justified by the constructive part.77 \"At the center of a constructivist conception of justice, therefore, stands the justification of a just basic structure, while at the center of a corresponding critical theory of justice stands the analysis and critique of legal, political, and social relations that are not reciprocally and generally justifiable. It requires a critique of relations of justification in a double sense, namely, both with respect to the real, particularly institutional possibility of discursive justification and (in terms of discourse theory) with regard to allegedly 'generally' accepted and acceptable results, that in truth are missing a sufficient grounding.\" (Forst, 2012a, p. 121) In Allen's perspective, this is tantamount to leaving critical theory behind, as it gives up its distinctive method of beginning from the intertwinement of reason and power. Instead, Forst ends up doing ideal moral philosophy on the one hand and applied ethics on the other (EP, p. 151 f.). Although I have not even come close to capture Allen's much more carefully developed reconstructions and criticisms of Habermas, Honneth, and Forst, two points should be clear: First, the conceptualization of the intertwinement of reason and power really is at the heart of Allen's argument. Her critique of \"progress as a fact\" and Eurocentrism in the works of Habermas, Honneth, and Forst aims to demonstrate how they misconstrue the relationship between reason and power. In each case, Allen's target is the residual idealism resulting from too neat a separation of reason and power, thereby failing to provide what Allen's has argued is distinctive of Frankfurt School critical theory, namely conceptualizing the intertwinement of reason and power in the service of (negativistic) emancipation. Second, and as a result, Frankfurt School critical theory has taken a step back behind its founders\u2014Adorno and Horkheimer\u2014and another step back behind their forefathers\u2014Marx and Engels. Thus, we find ourselves vis-\u00e0-vis the tired idealism of Kant and Hegel while having made at most a small step forward by better understanding how not to justify critical theory. One step forward, two steps back: Is it any wonder that when it comes to contemporary struggles, Frankfurt School critical theory has been rather silent? If my reading correctly identifies the conceptualization of the intertwinement of reason and power as the most important argumentative strand in Allen's book, the pressing questions are of course: How does Allen conceptualize the intertwinement of reason and power? And by which criteria does she judge it to be \"adequate\"? My argument proceeds as follows: First, Allen spells out her criteria in her controversial reading of Adorno and Foucault. Yet as we will see, they leave ample room for quite diverse, even contradictory, conceptualizations of the intertwinement of reason and power. Second, we should understand Allen's discussion of Antony Laden's \"social picture\" of reasoning as providing her conceptualization of the intertwinement of reason and power. Yet it is in tension with one important commonality of Adorno and Foucault that Allen (rightfully) emphasizes: the basic commitment to radical self-reflexivity. Third, I argue that Allen's distinction between normative and metanormative commitments, which is supposed to deal with this tension, does not solve the problem. This mild criticism brings into view a larger issue with her framing of the method of critical theory that relies on a certain understanding of \"normativity\" as a dimension of the world, not a phenomenon in the world. Therein, I will suggest in Section 4, lies a residual heritage of idealism that critical theory should get rid of. Let us turn, first, to Allen's specification of her initial criteria that (a) critical theory as a method must \"hold open the central tension between power, on the one hand, and normativity and rationality, on the other hand\" (EP, p. xiv) and that (b) critical theory as a political project must aim at (negativistic) emancipation. She explicates both criteria by reading Adorno and Foucault together, arguing that although there are obviously important differences between their approaches, they both share two basic commitments as well as an understanding of the resulting task for critical theory and of its appropriate method.88 Allen actually lists six points (EP, pp. 186\u2013198), but I prefer to combine the last three, as they all specify genealogy as a method of critical theory. Basic Adorno and Foucault are to the of reason but do not up on reason. Since they do not believe that practical reason the intertwinement of power and reason is neither a verdict against reason nor a to find an ideal part of reason that power. task is on its own rational and its with relations of (EP, p. with respect to Foucault, see EP, p. with respect to important is that critical theory's distinctive method must the tension between reason and power not just at the empirical but also at the conceptual (EP, p. both (as Allen argues Forst must to an understanding of reason too idealistic for critical theory.

As we see, Allen's criteria leave ample room for of the intertwinement of reason and power. In order to her conceptualization of reason's intertwinement with power, she turns to Anthony Laden's in her last (EP, pp. to reasoning is to which is a be it understanding or justification reasoning is an or practice that is social, and and of the of to take what we as for our as p. f.).

Rhetorical scholarship on such topics has been shaped by metadisciplinary movements, such as the visual, spatial, and affective \u201cturns\u201d in the humanities and social sciences. Rhetoricians of space have drawn on and contributed to widespread interest in public memory, mobile technologies, national borders, environmental communication, and global flows of capital and labor and tourism. Researchers in this arena of rhetorical studies have also addressed problems taken up by critical/cultural theorists more recently, including collective agency, posthuman subjectivity, and animate matter\u2014each of which poses challenges to conventional distinctions between subjects (as individual human rational actors) and objects (as lifeless things to be acted upon). Reconsidering these categories is important when conceptualizing place-making processes and the forces exerted by living landscapes. In pursuing these topics and questions, rhetorical theorists have contributed to conversations among researchers in multiple areas of specialty within communication studies. Such research also engaged themes of interest to scholars of cultural geography, urban planning, gender and sexuality studies, literary criticism, environmental science, and additional diverse disciplines as well as interdisciplinary movements. Communication scholars studying precarity, mobility, and other evolving topics are generating promising new contributions to conversations on space and rhetoric each year. However, essential insights regarding space and rhetorical theory are still being mined from postcolonial/decolonial, critical race, feminist, and queer approaches that many critics argue are insufficiently incorporated into the rhetorical theories of space or spatial theories of rhetoric most often applied and taught.",

In this article, I trace the trajectory of my research on identity, literacy, and English-language teaching informed by theories of investment and imagined communities. Data from English-language classrooms in Canada, Pakistan, and Uganda suggest that if learners have a sense of ownership over meaning-making, they will have enhanced identities as learners and participate more actively in literacy practices. The research challenges English teachers to consider which pedagogical practices are both appropriate and desirable in the teaching of literacy and which will help students develop the capacity for imagining a wider range of identities across time and space. Such practices, the research suggests, will necessitate changes in both teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 identity.",

We address this question by conducting an in\u2010depth longitudinal case study of a corporation's stakeholder engagement in social media and propose the concept of a networked legitimacy strategy. With this strategy, legitimacy is gained through participation in non\u2010hierarchical open platforms and the co\u2010construction of agendas. We explore the organizational transition needed to yield this new legitimacy approach. We argue that, in this context, legitimacy gains may increase when firms are able to reduce the control over the engagements and relate non\u2010hierarchically with their publics. We contribute to the extant literature on political corporate social responsibility and legitimacy by providing an understanding of a new context for engagement that reconfigures cultural, network, and power relations between the firm and their stakeholders in ways that challenge previous forms of legitimation.",

In one large transnational field research site in Africa, such unknowing pertains to vital material inequalities across the relations of scientific production. These inequalities are open to experience but remain often unacknowledged in public speech and scientific texts. This silence is not usually achieved by suppressing knowledge but through linguistic convention and differentiation between places and moments of knowing and ignorance. Switching between known and unknown according to situation and interlocutor is an important, largely implicit skill that maintains relations necessary to conduct clinical research\u2014linking bodies, lives, institutions, and technologies across differentials of resources, expertise, and power. Unknowing, then, facilitates research; and it shapes the resulting work and perpetuates the political and economic contradictions that pervade the context and the research endeavor itself. Unknowing thus poses a challenge for conventional anthropological modes of critique and engagement.",

Attributing the failures of liberal peacebuilding to a lack of legitimacy deriving from uncompromising efforts to impose a rigid market democratic state model on diverse populations emerging from conflict, the hybrid peace approach locates the possibility of a \u2018radical\u2019, post-liberal, and emancipatory peace in the agency of the local and the everyday and \u2018hybrid\u2019 formations of international/liberal and local/non-liberal institutions, practices, and values. However, this article argues, hybrid peace, emerging as an attempt to resolve a problem of difference and alterity specific to the context in which the crisis of liberal peacebuilding manifests, is a problem-solving tool for the encompassment and folding into globalising liberal order of cultural, political, and social orders perceived as radically different and obstructionist to its expansion. Deployed at the very point this expansion is beset by resistance and crisis, hybrid peace reproduces the liberal peace's logics of inclusion and exclusion, and through a reconfiguration of the international interface with resistant \u2018local\u2019 orders, intensifies the governmental and biopolitical reach of liberal peace for their containment, transformation, and assimilation.",

      "abstract": "\"In their study of social practices deemed traditional, scholars tend to use the concept and idea of tradition as an element of meaning in the practices under investigation. But just whose meaning is it? Is it a meaning generated by those who study tradition or those whose traditions are being studied? In both cases, particular criteria for traditionality are employed, whether these are explicated or not. Individuals and groups will no doubt continue to uphold their traditional practices or refer to their practices as traditional. While they are in no way obliged to explicate in analytical terms their criteria for traditionality, the same cannot be said for those who make the study of traditions their profession. In scholarly analysis, traditions need to be explained instead of used as explanations for apparent repetitions and replications or symbolic linking in social practice, values, history, and heritage politics. This book takes a closer look at \u2018tradition\u2019 and \u2018folklore\u2019 in order to conceptualize them within discourses on modernity and modernism. The first section discusses \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 as modern concepts and the study of folklore as a modern trajectory. The underlying tenet here is that non-modernity cannot be represented without modern mediation, which therefore makes the representations of non-modernity epistemologically modern. The second section focuses on the nation-state of Finland and the nationalistic use of folk traditions in the discursive production of Finnish modernity and its Others. The insights are applicable worldwide in discussions on cultural representation. \"",

The purpose of this article is to contribute a theoretical approach to understand conditions and constraints for societal change towards sustainable development. In order to break with unsustainable norms, habits, practices, and structures, there is a need for learning for transformation, not only adaption. Based on a critical literature review within the field of learning for sustainable development, our approach is a development of the concept of transformative learning, by integrating three additional dimensions\u2014Institutional Structures, Social Practices, and Conflict Perspectives. This approach acknowledges conflicts on macro, meso, and micro levels, as well as structural and cultural constraints. It contends that transformative learning is processual, interactional, long-term, and cumbersome. It takes place within existing institutions and social practices, while also transcending them. The article adopts an interdisciplinary social science perspective that acknowledges the importance of transformative learning in order for communities, organizations, and individuals to be able to deal with global sustainability problems, acknowledging the societal and personal conflicts involved in such transformation.",

      "abstract": "A central debate in critical management studies (CMS) revolves around the concern that critical research has rather little influence on what managers do in practice. We argue that this is partly because CMS research often focuses on criticizing antagonistically, rather than engaging with managers. In light of this, we seek to re-interpret the anti-performative stance of CMS by focusing on how researchers understand, conceptualize and make use of the performative effects of language. Drawing on the works of JL Austin and Judith Butler, we put forward the concept of progressive performativity, which requires critical researchers to stimulate the performative effects of language in order to induce incremental, rather than radical, changes in managerial behaviour. The research framework we propose comprises two interrelated processes: (i) the strategy of micro-engagement, which allows critical researchers to identify and \u2018ally\u2019 with internal activists among managers, and to support their role as internal agents of change; and (ii) \u2018reflexive conscientization\u2019 \u2212 that is, a dialogic process between researchers and researched that aims to gradually raise the critical consciousness of actors in order to provide spaces in which new practices can be \u2018talked into existence\u2019 through the performative effects of language.",

Further internationalizing the ethnographic discussion on prisons by broadening the predominant focus on the United States and the English-speaking world, the review is organized around a main line of discussion: the prison\u2013society relation and the articulation between intramural and extramural worlds. More or less apparent in field research, this articulation is addressed from different perspectives\u2014within and across different scales and analytic frames\u2014whether centered more on the workings of the institution or on prisoners and their social worlds, both within and outside walls. The porosity of prison boundaries, increasingly acknowledged, has also been problematized and ethnographically documented in different ways: from prison-in-context to interface approaches, both more reflexive and attuned to broader theoretical debates.",

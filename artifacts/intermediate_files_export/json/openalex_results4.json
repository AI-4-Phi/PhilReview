      "abstract": "Abstract Critical social theories look critically at the ways in which particular social arrangements hinder human flourishing, with a view to bringing about social change for the better. In this they are guided by the idea of a good society in which the identified social impediments to human flourishing would once and for all have been removed. The question of how these guiding ideas of the good life can be justified as valid across socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs is the most fundamental difficulty facing critical social theories today. This problem of justification, which can be traced back to certain key shifts in the modern Western social imaginary, calls on contemporary theories to negotiate the tensions between the idea of context\u2010transcendent validity and their own anti\u2010authoritarian impulses. Habermas makes an important contribution towards resolving the problem, but takes a number of wrong turnings. Keywords: Critical theorynon\u2010authoritarian theoryautonomyHabermasformal pragmaticsHabermas's theory of justice Notes 1 In situating critical social theory within the modern Western social imaginary, I do not wish to imply that this form of modernity is in any sense superior to other forms. I follow S. N. Eisenstadt in confining myself to the thesis that it is distinctive; I also follow Eisenstadt in recognizing 'the great variability of the symbolic, ideological and institutional responses to it [Western modernity], of the ways in which different civilizations and societies interpret different symbolic premises of modernity and different modern institutional patterns and dynamics'. S. N. Eisenstadt, 'Introduction', in S. N. Eisenstadt (ed.) Patterns of Modernity, Vol. 1: The West (London: Frances Pinter, 1987), pp. 1\u201311, here, p. 5. 2 Here I am guided by Cornelius Castoriadis's view that every society creates a social imaginary that determines society's values and the institutions that embody them. However, I use the term in a general way without committing myself to other aspects of Castoriadis's account of the social imaginary. See C. Castoriadis, The Imaginary Institution of Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987). My use of the term is closer to that of Charles Taylor. See C. Taylor, Modern Social Imaginaries (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2004). 3 A well\u2010known example here is Nietzsche, who challenged key elements of the modern world\u2010view, for example, the assumptions that human beings are equal and that historical time is progressive, and took on the task of reorienting our perceptions with regard to these. See F. Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans. T. Common (London: Allen and Unwin, 1967) and F. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, trans. R. J. Hollingdale (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1973). 4 R. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). 5 This is Robert Brandom's gloss on Rorty's utopian idea of unfettered imaginative activity in his 'Vocabularies of Pragmatism: Synthesizing Naturalism and Historicism', in R. Brandom (ed.) Rorty and his Critics (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), p. 179. Rorty claims to be in enthusiastic agreement with the sections of Brandom's essays from which this quotation is taken in his 'Response to Robert Brandom', in Rorty and his Critics, pp. 184 and 189. 6 See Butler's contributions to J. Butler, E. Laclau and S. \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality (London: Verso, 2000). 7 J. Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols. 1 and 2, trans. T. McCarthy (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1984 and 1987). 8 Examples here are A. Honneth, Struggle for Recognition, trans. J. Anderson (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995), J. Habermas, 'Individuation through Socialization: On George Herbert Mead's Theory of Subjectivity', in his Postmetaphysical Thinking, trans. W. M. Hohengarten (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), pp. 149\u2013204, and J. Habermas, 'Morality and Ethical Life: Does Hegel's Critique of Kant Apply to Discourse Ethics?', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, trans. C. Lenhardt and S. Weber Nicholsen (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), pp. 195\u2013215. 9 M. Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006). For an earlier effort in the same direction, see M. Cooke, 'A Space of One's Own: Autonomy, Privacy, Liberty', Philosophy and Social Criticism, 25 (1) (1999), pp. 23\u201353. 10 More precisely, the 'us' refers to 'us educated, sophisticated, tolerant, wet liberals, the people who are always willing to hear the other side, to think out all the implications, etc.' R. Rorty, 'Putnam and the Relativist Menace', Journal of Philosophy, 90 (9) (1993), 443\u201361, here, pp. 451\u20132. 11 For Butler, the normative and optimistic aspect of critical social thinking consists 'in the possibilities for expanding the key terms of liberalism, rendering them more inclusive, more dynamic and more concrete'. See J. Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', in Butler, Laclau and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 11\u201343, here, p. 13. Butler actually refers to 'the normative and optimistic moment' of hegemony; however, her formulation seems equally applicable to critical social thinking as she conceives it. 12 'Dogmatic' is used in the 'harmless sense' that for us, who have developed our identities within the socio\u2010cultural context of Western modernity, it cannot be circumvented. J. Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, trans. W. Rehg (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), pp. 445\u201356. 13 See J. Butler, 'Gender Trouble, Feminist Theory, and Psychoanalytic Discourse', in L. Nicholson (ed.) Feminism/Postmodernism (New York: Routledge, 1990), p. 324\u201340. In her most recent writings, however, there is some evidence that Butler is now less hostile to the notions of subjectivity with which the idea of autonomy is linked and may even be prepared to view autonomy as one of the key terms of liberal modernity that are open to creative rearticulation and re\u2010enactment. See J. Butler, Antigone's Claim: Kinship between Life and Death (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000) and J. Butler, Undoing Gender (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). 14 I outline the concept of autonomy that in my view best takes account of this intuition in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 15 Ferrara posits coherence and depth as two of the four normative requirements of authentic identity: A. Ferrara, Reflective Authenticity (London: Routledge, 1998). 16 Butler is likely to reject the very terms in which this disagreement is cast. Nor is it clear on which side of the divide she would position herself, even if she were to accept its terms. In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, I argue, nonetheless, that this is an issue of central concern to her theory and that a context\u2010transcending position would make best sense of her idea of universality as radical translation (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). 17 For Butler, all forms of identity \u2013 for example, the identity of individual subjects \u2013 are constituted differentially. That is, their constitution produces a constitutive outside that can never become fully inside or immanent. On the 'incompletion' of what she calls the subject position, see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', p. 12. 18 Butler, 'Dynamic Conclusions', in Butler, Laclan and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 263\u2013280, here, p. 268. 19 Habermas, who defends a context\u2010transcending position, accuses radically contextualist approaches such as Rorty's of collapsing the distinction between the strategic and non\u2010strategic uses of language. J. Habermas, 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn', in his On the Pragmatics of Communication, edited and with an introduction by M. Cooke (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), pp. 343\u201382. Rorty replies in his 'Response to Habermas', in Brandom, Rorty and his Critics, p. 58. 20 These objections to a radically contextualist critical approach are tailored to discursive \u2013 argumentation\u2010based \u2013 models of social criticism. However, as I point out in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, there are equivalent objections to non\u2010argumentative models of social criticism. 21 Other contemporary thinkers who explicitly endorse a context\u2010transcending approach include Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser. See their respective contributions in N. Fraser and A. Honneth, Redistribution or Recognition? A Political\u2010Philosophical Exchange (London: Verso, 2003). 22 The term Habermas uses to describe what I call the anti\u2010authoritarian impulse of contemporary critical social theory is 'post\u2010metaphysical'. See Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking. For a brief account of the postmetaphysical character of Habermas's idea of communicative rationality see M. Cooke, Language and Reason (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1994), pp. 38\u201343. As I point out below, Habermas's postmetaphysical approach goes beyond anti\u2010authoritarian approaches by leaving no room for the postulate of a transcendent \u2013 metaphysical \u2013 object. 23 Axel Honneth uses the term 'Left\u2010Hegelian' to describe the tradition of critical social thinking out of which the critical theory of the Frankfurt School emerges. The term has the advantage that it makes explicit the Frankfurt School's concern to rearticulate the critical social thinking of Hegel, as interpreted above all by Marx and Luk\u00e1cs. See A. Honneth, 'Eine Soziale Pathologie der Vernunft. Zur intellektuellen Erbschaft der Kritischen Theorie', in C. Halbig and M. Quante (eds), Sozialphilosophie zwischen Kritik und Anerkennung (M\u00fcnster, Hamburg, Berlin, Wien, London: LIT Verlag, 2003). 24 Cf. A. Honneth, 'The Social Dynamics of Disrespect: On the Location of Critical Theory Today', Constellations, 1 (2) (1994), pp. 255\u201369. 25 M. Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, The Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. J. Cumming (London: Allen Lane, 1973). 26 Evidently, it also gives rise to a problem of motivation since the authors eliminate the possibility of any kind of human reflection on, or conscious human resistance to, the oppressive, dehumanizing effects of twentieth\u2010century capitalism. 27 Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols 1 and 2. 28 J. Habermas, 'What is Universal Pragmatics?', in Habermas, On the Pragmatics of Communication, pp. 21\u2013103. See also Cooke, Language and Reason. It should be noted that Habermas sees reconstructive theories as dependent on indirect validation by other theories. See J. Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 116\u201394, here, pp. 116\u201318. 29 Habermas's clearest statement of the role which formal pragmatics plays in justifying his theory of communicative action can be found his writings on discourse ethics. See J. Habermas, 'Discourse Ethics: Notes on A Program of Philosophical Justification', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 42\u2013115 (esp. pp. 82\u201398). Here, the universalist character of his formal\u2010pragmatic hypotheses is evident, for example, when he states that 'the principle of universalization [\u2026] is implied by the presuppositions of argumentation in general' (p.86, my italics). To be sure, it is not clear how exactly this statement is to be understood. On occasion, he suggests that certain of the strong idealizations on which his theory depends are the result of socio\u2010cultural learning processes; these learning processes, which come about for historically contingent reasons, can be seen as developing the inherent logic of normative intuitions that are features of communication in all socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs. However, this qualification merely increases his burden of proof, for he now has to show not only that the normative intuitions in question are a feature of communication in general but also that there is an inherent logic to their development along the reflexive and universalist lines he describes. In his writings of the 1970s and 1980s Habermas held the view that reconstructive theories of individual moral development of the kind proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg could help him in this regard, while acknowledging that the difficulties involved in developing any such theory on a socio\u2010cultural level were considerable (see J. Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society, trans. T. McCarthy (London: Heinemann, 1979) and Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'). Since then, however, he has made no attempt to develop the required theory of socio\u2010cultural learning and has, moreover, expressed reservations about a number of fundamental aspects of Kohlberg's theory (see J. Habermas, 'A Philosophico\u2010Political Profile', in his Autonomy and Solidarity, ed. Peter Dews (London: Verso, 1986), pp. 149\u201389, here, p. 168 and J. Habermas, 'Lawrence Kohlberg and Neo\u2010Aristotelianism', in his Justification and Application: Remarks on Discourse Ethics, trans. C. Cronin (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993), pp. 113\u201332). For these reasons, I leave aside this complication in the following. 30 Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 29\u201338. To be sure, this constitutes an objection to his theory only in the absence of a theory of socio\u2010cultural learning that would show the idealizations in question to be the logical necessary development of normative intuitions that are features of communicative practices in general (see n. 29 above). 31 Seyla Benhabib makes this point with regard to the idealizing suppositions guiding moral argumentation in her Situating the Self (New York: Routledge, 1992), pp. 29\u201332. Cf. Cooke, Language and Reason, pp. 31\u20134. 32 See Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 150\u201362. 33 See Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, p. 109. Here he explicitly endorses the formal\u2010pragmatic justification of the moral principle of universalizability that he conducted in his earlier work. 34 In his writings subsequent to The Theory of Communicative Action there is some evidence that Habermas is prepared to accept that formal pragmatics provides only limited support for his concept of communicative rationality. Although he continues to affirm the importance of formal pragmatics as a justificatory strategy, on occasion he seems willing to admit that, on its own, formal pragmatics, cannot justify the emancipatory perspective offered by his critical social theory. See, for example, J. Habermas, 'A Genealogical Analysis of the Cognitive Content of Morality', in his The Inclusion of the Other, ed. C. Cronin and P. de Greiff (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000), pp. 3\u201346, here, p. 45. Furthermore, I discern evidence of an implicit acknowledgment of the limited justificatory power of formal pragmatics in Habermas's recent metatheoretical writings, in particular in the 'weak' naturalist argument he outlines in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1999), pp. 27\u201340. This argument aims to shed light on the question of how we can uphold a conception of objectivity notwithstanding the multiplicity and contingency of world\u2010generating grammars. In the course of the argument Habermas acknowledges his theory's reliance on the assumption that human beings unavoidably conceive of the progress of history as the possibility of learning. I regard this acknowledgment as a definite step in the right direction. See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'Socio\u2010Cultural Learning as a \"Transcendental\" Fact: Habermas's Postmetaphysical Perspective', International Journal of Philosophical Studies, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 63\u201383 and M. Cooke, 'Between \"Objectivism\" and \"Contextualism\": the Normative Foundations of Social Philosophy', Critical Horizons, 1 (2) (2000), pp. 193\u2013227. 35 See especially Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, Chs 7 and 8. 36 See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism: Habermas's Conception of Justice', European Journal of Political Theory, 2 (3) (2003), pp. 298\u2013300. 37 J. Rawls, Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993). It is noteworthy that Habermas criticizes (what I call) the radically contextualist aspect of Rawls's theory. See J. Habermas, 'Reconciliation through the Public Use of Reason: Remarks on John Rawls's Political Liberalism', Journal of Philosophy, 92 (3) (1995), pp. 109\u201331. Reprinted in Habermas, The Inclusion of the Other, pp. 49\u201373. 38 See nn 30 and 29 above. 39 Benhabib makes a similar point in her Situating the Self, p. 32. Indeed, the justificatory strategy I propose is similar to Benhabib's in a number of respects. The differences between our positions have to do with my proposed conceptualization of the idea of context\u2010transcending validity that is operative in argumentation. In M. Cooke, 'Habermas and Consensus', European Journal of Philosophy, 1 (3) (1993), pp. 247\u201367, I argue that this aspect of Benhabib's theory is underdeveloped. In Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 7, I make some concrete suggestions as to how it should be developed. 40 I develop it further in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 41 I develop it further ibid., Chs 1 and 2. 42 I discuss his theory of truth in some detail in M. Cooke, 'Habermas on Meaning and Truth', European Journal of Philosophy, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 1\u201323, in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism' and in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 5. 43 Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking, p. 8. 44 Ibid., p. 139. 45 It has been criticized, for example, for its restriction of moral discourse to discussion from the standpoint of the 'generalized other', neglecting the standpoint of the 'concrete other' (in Benhabib, Situating the Self, pp. 340\u20132); for its proposal that the idea of an agreement reached in an idealized process of moral discourse can be used as a standard for testing the validity of actual moral norms and principles (in A. Wellmer, 'Ethics and Dialogue', in his The Persistence of Modernity, trans. D. Midgley (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 1991), pp. 113\u2013231 and in C. Lafont, 'Realismus und Konstruktivismus in der kantianischen Moralphilosophie \u2013 das Beispiel der Diskursethik', Deutsche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Philosophie, 50 (1) (2002), pp. 39\u201352); and for making moral insight dependent on the exchange of arguments in moral discourse (in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', pp. 294\u20138). 46 Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Chs 5, 6 and 7. 47 See J. Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 271\u2013317, esp. 296\u2013301. 48 See Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit'. 49 J. Habermas, 'Einf\u00fchrung: Realismus nach der pragmatischen Wende', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 7\u201364, here, pp. 56\u201357; see also 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', esp. pp. 293\u20135. The German word normally used by Habermas is unverf\u00fcgbar. 50 The main elements of Habermas's revised theory of truth are set out in his 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit' and in his 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn'. 51 Judith Butler gives examples of ways in which the concept of universality has been vigorously contested, resulting in creative new articulations and restagings of it (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). Similarly, the concept of autonomy has been the subject of vigorous contestation and rearticulation. Even the concept of contestability can be the object of socio\u2010cultural learning: Albrecht Wellmer, for example, suggests that the question of which 'truths' can be contested is itself a contested matter, suggesting the need to reconsider the concept of contestability itself (see A. Wellmer, Sprachphilosophie (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2004), pp. 250\u201377). 52 See Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', and Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Ch. 7. 53 K. Marx, 'Theses on Feuerbach', in D. McLellan (ed.) Karl Marx: Selected Writings (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 156\u20138. 54 However, in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I argue that a non\u2010authoritarian conception of theory calls on critical social theory to rearticulate the traditional Marxian notion of praxis. 55 In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I suggest that contemporary critical social theories are well advised to give up the aspiration of providing a 'grand explanation' of what is wrong with the existing social order and to concentrate, instead, on analysing how the impediments to human flourishing are reproduced and disseminated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \"Public sphre\" is often used by historians of modern Latin America without much concern about its theoretical and methodological implications. Some historians have used it as a model to fit evidence about public debates and politics during the modern period, yet few have engaged it as a theory with deeper methodological and conceptual implications. This article will review the historical literature that has applied Habermas's ideas to Latin American history. Focusing on a few particularly important books, the article will examine potential avenues for research and comparisons. Rather than becoming a new orthodoxy for the study of the region, the theory of the public sphere is establishing a dialogue among historians interested in intellectual phenomena and political discourse (most of them centered on the history of liberalism after independence) and those historians whose interest in social formations have framed their study in terms of hegemony and class domination. The article will argue that a critical use of Habermas's ideas (one that is more systematic about the gender and class exclusions built into the bourgeois public sphere, and that problematizes the connections between the specific development of capitalism in peripheral regions and their embrace of European political traditions) could yield useful results in terms of new research and an inclusive synthesis of recent literature interested in politics, culture and hegemony in Latin America.

See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Discourse ethics: notes on a program of philosophical justification' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (Cambridge, 1990). For the normative implications of the public-sphere model, see Nancy Fraser, 'Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy', Social Text, nos 25/26 (1990). See also Thomas A. McCarthy, The Critical Theory of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, first MIT Press paperback edition (Cambridge, 1981), chap. 1; J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Ciencia y t\u00e9cnica como 'ideolog\u00eda' (Mexico City, 1993). Implicit in Habermas's idea of 'communicative rationality' is 'the central experience of the unconstrained, unifying, consensus-bringing force of argumentative speech': J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, vol. 1, Reason and the Rationalization of Society, trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston, 1984), 10. 5Arthur Strum, 'A bibliography on the concept of \u00d6ffentlichkeit', New German Critique, lxi (1994). Habermas refers to 'seminal theories', like those by Freud and Marx, that 'inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research' resulting in 'hybrid discourses' that may be criticized from the academic establishment but could generate 'new research traditions'. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Philosophy as stand-in and interpreter' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, op. cit., 15. 6The OED provides two examples of the term, both dated 1992. See entries for 'maternalize' and 'nonsensification', Oxford English Dictionary (available online at: http://www.oed.com/). For the parallel with Weber see Joan B. Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution (Ithaca, 1988), 10. 7Habermas links the public sphere with his theory of communicative action at a 'fundamental' level: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Further reflections on the public sphere', Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, 1997), 422, 41. Other scholars, mentioned below, have already suggested the need to confront analyses based on Gramsci and Habermas. 8Habermas's initial definition is tentative and contains the diversity of issues outlined above: 'The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labour. The medium of this political confrontation was peculiar and without historical precedent: people's public use of their reason.' See Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27. See also J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article', New German Critique, iii (1974). On the historical character of the definition, see Moishe Postone, 'Political theory and historical analysis' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit. 9James Van Horn Melton, The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe (New York, 2001), 10, 12. 10For similar agendas see E.

A similar census would probably be impossible today. See also Peter Uwe Hohendahl, 'The public sphere: models and boundaries' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 108. For an example of these possibilities see Madeleine Hurd, Public Spheres, Public Mores, and Democracy: Hamburg and Stockholm, 1870\u20131914 (Ann Arbor, 2000). 17See a discussion of the implications of this from the point of view of Mexican history in Pablo Piccato, 'Introducci\u00f3n: \u00bfModelo para armar?

After independence, 'Lo radicalmente nuevo es la creaci\u00f3n de una escena p\u00fablica': Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 13, 23, 87. This parallels Benedict Anderson's claim that 'the convergence of capitalism and print technology \u2026 created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation', and his focus on American Creole identities as early examples of this process. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (New York and London, 1983), 46. Concepts like el pueblo or lo p\u00fablico also had a history that illustrated the incorporation of traditional and modern notions, as explored by Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 'Reflexiones sobre la terminolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica del liberalismo' in Carlos Illades, Brian Connaughton and Sonia P\u00e9rez Toledo (eds), Construcci\u00f3n de la legitimidad pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico (Zamora, 1999). 20Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 30. See Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Penser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (Paris, 1978). For Palti, Guerra's use of Habermas lacked a 'strong' critique of the public-sphere model and failed to recognize Raymond Kosseleck's work as a necessary antecedent. Furet and Cochin were decisive in Guerra's work to strengthen that critique, without embracing 'las teor\u00edas multiculturalistas \"posmodernas\"'. El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 Palti, 'Guerra y Habermas: ilusiones y realidad de la esfera p\u00fablica Latinoamericana' in Erika Pani and Alicia Salmer\u00f3n (eds), Conceptualizar lo que se ve: Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Guerra historiador, homenaje (Mexico City, 2004), 466. 21See Dena Goodman, 'Public sphere and private life: toward a synthesis of current historiographical approaches to the Old Regime', History and Theory, xxxi, 1 (1992), 8, 12. Guerra's explicit rejection of Habermas's Marxism in Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 86n, 87, 14. For studies inspired by Guerra's insights and a closer connection to local contexts, see Francois-Xavier Guerra and Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (eds), Los espacios p\u00fablicos en Iberoam\u00e9rica: Ambig\u00fcedades y problemas: Siglos XVIII\u2013XIX (Mexico, 1999). For the public sphere as part of the politicization of new national societies, see Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez Bernaldo, 'Sociabilidad, espacio urbano y politizaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Buenos Aires (1820\u20131852)' in Hilda Sabato and Alberto Rodolfo Lettieri (eds), La vida pol\u00edtica en la Argentina del siglo XIX: armas, votos y voces (Buenos Aires, 2003), 199. 22Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 12, 101. Such characterization of the socio-economic impact and causes of the revolutions of independence is challenged in John Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750\u20131940 (Princeton, 1988); Eric Van Young, The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology, and the Mexican Struggle for Independence, 1810\u20131821 (Stanford, 2001). 23Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 17, 91, 234. The Habermasian focus on 'a new, autonomous, free, and sovereign public' implies a marked alternative from Furet's Tocquevillian emphasis on associations and modes of sociability as the base for a modern public opinion. Chartier, Cultural Origins, op. cit., 16\u201317. 24Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 52, 99. Guerra's emphasis on culture fits well with older visions of 'Latin American culture' as something clearly identifiable; for Edmundo O'Gorman, this common identity meant that the influence of the United States is negligible in the emergence of a Latin American political culture. Edmundo O'Gorman, 'Hegel y el moderno panamericanismo', Letras de M\u00e9xico, ii, 8 (1939). See Charles Hale, 'Edmundo O'Gorman y la historia nacional', Signos Hist\u00f3ricos, ii, 3 (2000), 17, 24. Absent is a problematization of neo-colonialism as an informal and subordinate mode of entering modernity. See Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi, The Contemporary History of Latin America, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1993). 25McEvoy, La utop\u00eda republicana, op. cit., 11. 26McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit.

If in the end the new nations rejected liberal monarchism, explains Rojas, it was because of the revolutionary logic of insurgency and the consequent loyalist response, but not because of any inherently democratic feature of the new public sphere.

See McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit., 43. 31For the 'tradici\u00f3n republicana' as the centre of a long-term political history of Mexico that stresses local and corporative representation over democracy and equality, see Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez Ch\u00e1vez, La tradici\u00f3n republicana del buen gobierno (Mexico, 1993); Antonio Annino, 'Ciudadan\u00eda versus gobernabilidad republicana en M\u00e9xico: Los or\u00edgenes de un dilema' in Hilda S\u00e1bato (ed.), Ciudadan\u00eda pol\u00edtica y formaci\u00f3n de las naciones: Perspectivas hist\u00f3ricas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Mexico City, 1999).

This article attempts to shift the emphasis away from pRA's practice towards its theoretical underpinnings. The article argues that PRA's practice/ empiricist orientation causes it to be insfficiently theorised and politicised. As a result, questions about inclusiveness, the role of rnt facilitators, and the personal behaviour of elites overshadow, or sometimes ignore, questions of legitimacy, justice, power and the politics of gender and dffirence. The article draws on arguments and debates involving Habermasian 'deliberative democracy' and post-structuralist notions of power Most of those who have innovated in developing ene have been practitioners, concerned with what works. and what will work better. not academic theorists concerned with why it works. They have been searching not for new theories or principles but for new and better ways of learning and doing. For them, the power and utility of ... pRA, undertaken with rapport and self-critical rigor, are empirical facts of common experience: they know that they work, and that done well they can lead to better development. ( Chambers, 1994b: 1262) Robert Chambers' work on Participatory Rural Appraisal (pne) has become remarkably influential in Nco circles and among national and international development agencies. pRA champions local knowledge and puts forth a methodology aimed at enabling local people to take control over their own development.",

Basic rights are reciprocally and generally justifiable and binding claims on others (agents or institutions) that they should do (or refrain from doing) certain things determined by the content of these rights. We call these rights basic because they define the status of persons as full members of a normative order in such a way that they provide protection from severe forms of legal, political and social domination. The very ground of these rights is the status of persons as free and equal normative authorities within the order they are subject to. In other words, these rights are grounded in a fundamental moral right to justification.",

      "abstract": "Social media has become a key term in Media and Communication Studies and public discourse for characterising platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, Wordpress, Blogspot, Weibo, Pinterest, Foursquare and Tumblr. This paper discusses the role of the concept of the public sphere for understanding social media critically. It argues against an idealistic interpretation of Habermas and for a cultural-materialist understanding of the public sphere concept that is grounded in political economy. It sets out that Habermas\u2019 original notion should best be understood as a method of immanent critique that critically scrutinises limits of the media and culture grounded in power relations and political economy. The paper introduces a theoretical model of public service media that it uses as foundation for identifying three antagonisms of the contemporary social media sphere in the realms of the economy, the state and civil society. It concludes that these limits can only be overcome if the colonisation of the social media lifeworld is countered politically so that social media and the Internet become public service and commons-based media.Acknowledgement: This paper is the extended version of Christian Fuchs\u2019 inaugural lecture for his professorship of social media at the University of Westminster that he took up on February 1st, 2013.

      "abstract": "Power in communication takes two main forms. As 'external' power, it consists in the ability to acknowledge or disregard a speaker or a discourse. As 'internal' power, it is the ability of an argument to eliminate other arguments by demonstrating its superiority. A positive or negative value may be ascribed to these forms of power. Four ideal-typical positions are discussed--strategy, technocracy, constructionism, and deliberation. Public deliberation has three virtues--civic virtue, governance virtue and cognitive virtue. Deliberation lowers the propensity to, and the benefit of, strategic behaviour. It also increases knowledge, enhancing the quality of decisions. For Habermas, the unity of reason is expressed in the possibility of agreement on the most convincing argument. However, sometimes conflicts are deep-lying, principles and factual descriptions are profoundly different, and uncertainty is radical. The best argument cannot be found. There is no universal reason. The question is whether non-strategic agreement may spring from the incommensurability of languages. In search of an answer, Rawls's concept of overlapping consensus, the feminist theory of the public sphere, and the idea of deliberation as co-operation are discussed. The argument developed is that the approach to deliberative democracy may be renewed by rethinking its motivational and cognitive elements. Public deliberation is grounded on a pre-political level of co-operation. Intractable controversies may be faced at the level of practices, looking for local, contextual answers.",

Drawing on Hans Georg GADAMER, as well as other hermeneutic thinkers, an introductory overview of five characteristics of a hermeneutic approach is offered in this paper. Further, it is suggested that hermeneutics can fruitfully be partnered with a critical approach. In this regard, a critical attitude and a metaxological approach are explored and a conceptualization of critical hermeneutics is proposed. It is suggested that hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics implicitly underpin qualitative inquiry, both of which emphasize the interpretive act of understanding, and a dialogue on this subject is invited.

A range of criticisms are discussed which target the underlying premises, the analytical methodology and the disputed areas of reader response and the integration of contextual factors. Controversial issues such as the predominantly negative focus of much CDA scholarship, and the status of CDA as an emergent \u201cintellectual orthodoxy\u201d, are also reviewed.

A survey of article titles reporting on research into student learning was carried out in three key higher education journals, and the results of this were then considered in the context of other, related research perspectives. The article will first report on the results of this review, and then discuss these results in the context of theoretical moves in psychology and sociology over the same period of time. The trends identified in the higher education journals will then be compared to research into student learning in higher education which is published in two other disciplinary areas: adult education and sociolinguistics. After raising some questions that arise from these comparisons, the final section of the article will outline some suggestions about ways in which higher education researchers might begin to \u2018think differently\u2019 about learning and research in this field.",

Using alternative rationality assumptions, such as bounded rationality, irrationality, substantive rationality and the notion of rationality as a social construct, we conceptualise impression management in alternative ways as (1) self-serving bias, (2) symbolic management and (3) accounting rhetoric. This contributes to an enhanced understanding of impression management in a corporate reporting context.",

      "abstract": "Wherever we turn, we see diverse things scaled for us, from cities to economies, from history to love. We know scale by many names and through many familiar antinomies: local and global, micro and macro events. Even the most critical among us often proceed with our analysis as if such scales were the ready-made platforms of social life, rather than asking how, why, and to what effect are scalar distinctions forged in the first place. How do scalar distinctions help actors and analysts alike make sense of and navigate their social worlds? What do these distinctions reveal and what do they conceal? How are scales construed and what effects do they have on the way those who abide by them think and act? This pathbreaking volume attends to the practical labor of scale-making and the communicative practices this labor requires. From an ethnographic perspective, the authors demonstrate that scale is practice and process before it becomes product, whether in the work of projecting the commons, claiming access to the big picture, or scaling the seriousness of a crime. \u201cHow shall we fathom the world, bringing its varied scales into analytic perspective? The authors collected in this bold and subtle volume slow down the question, arguing that \u2018scale\u2019 is made, not born, and that \u2018perspectives\u2019 are semiotic accomplishments and not stable points of anchor.\u201d STEFAN HELMREICH, Elting E.

For more than 30 years, critical research in information systems (IS) has challenged the assumption that technology innovation is inherently desirable and hence to the benefit of all. Nevertheless, how researchers view the nature of being critical has changed over time, and so too have the ways that they pursue their critical agenda and argue for their contributions. In this paper, I present a brief historical account of critical IS research, tracing the theoretical perspectives that have been dominant at different times and the empirical efforts that were guided by them. As part of tracing our current position I examine two key texts authored by Chrisanthi Avgerou and Geoff Walsham, who pursue different types of critical agenda and make distinctive empirically based contributions concerning the substantive issue of global diversity in IS innovation and its consequences. Overall, I suggest that the IS field now accepts broad definitions of the nature of being critical, but despite having a body of empirical critical research from which to learn, we are not making the most of our opportunities to do so, which retards further development. While I do not seek to develop a prescription for conducting and evaluating critical research, or try to encourage lengthy confessional accounts of research conduct in all journal papers, I do argue that we need more explicit reflections about our sustained long\u2010term efforts in the field. Such reflections might consider the way we develop our critical arguments and insights, and what we strive for and accomplish through our interventions. In effect, the IS field has not yet reached a position where the theory and practice of doing critical research are informing each other.",

Feminism and constructivism share a commitment to an ontology of becoming that can serve as a common basis for conversation. Yet there are also profound differences between feminists and constructivists. First, most IR feminists approach gender and power as integral elements in processes of construction, whereas most constructivists consider power to be external to such processes. This failure to conceptualize power and gender as social and pervasive leads constructivists to miss an important part of the empirical reality of power politics. Second, constructivists tend to ignore the implications of a postpositivist epistemology, whereas for feminists the question of \u201cWho knows?\u201d is crucial. We argue that the constructivist failure to problematize the research process as a social (and therefore political) process of construction is logically inconsistent with an ontology of becoming. We introduce empirical materials to illustrate the advantages of feminist approaches. We hope to advance a dialogue between feminism and constructivism because the two approaches add to each other and in combination can yield better theoretical and empirical understandings of the world.",

Phenomenological, discursive and psychoanalytically informed perspectives, amongst others, have become increasingly popular alternatives to \u2018mainstream\u2019 cognitive social psychology. This paper describes the fundamental philosophy and methodology underpinning phenomenological psychology along with discussion of a number of key issues in qualitative research in social psychology. In particular, I discuss the role of interpretation, the turn to language and need for political engagement within critical social psychology. More recently, there has been a growth in phenomenologically informed narrative theories and methodologies and in this paper I introduce my own development of a critical narrative analysis. In the process I discuss some of the most pressing debates about research within the phenomenological tradition and provide rebuttals, solutions and possible future directions for phenomenological theory and research that may lead to yet greater recognition for this social psychological perspective.",

We argue that a sensemaking approach is useful for examining how ethical truces emerge in equivocal situations. To understand how actors navigate through ethical complexity, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry into the multistakeholder practices of setting Fairtrade Minimum Prices. We offer three contributions. First, we develop a process model of ethics as sensemaking that explains how actors come to collectively agree on what is ethical in complex situations, even if no complete consensus arises. Second, our findings suggest that moral intuition and affect also motivate ethical judgment alongside moral reasoning. Third, an ethical sensemaking perspective explains some of the pitfalls actors confront in coping with ethical complexities in practice and how they attend to the challenges arising from stark inequalities in extreme contexts.",

      "abstract": "Ram\u00f3n Flecha's The dialogic society is not a classical sociological book\u2014it is, rather, a deep analytical essay with autobiographical thought. This brilliant blurring of genres reminds me of Michael Burawoy's Public sociology: Between utopia and anti-utopia (2021) or some of Richard Sennett's books. It is also a blurring of sociology\u2014a sociology that is made not only by sociologists but also by citizens, artists, or scientists. Here, citizens are invited not just to read the book (and endorse it on the back cover) but to dialogue with it as participant observers. Translated into four languages, it is a bridge call between what would be scientific knowledge and other forms of practical knowledge that come from citizens\u2019 involvement. Flecha highlights from the very beginning (Part 1) nine orientations of how sociology (and, more broadly, the social sciences) can be liked and used by citizens and scientists, whatever their disciplines. These orientations are: dialogue, improvement (the social impact of research), truth (against ideology), goodness (part of democracy), beauty (social), gender (against sexual and gender identity discrimination), cultures (other discriminations), universal, and forward-looking (solidarity with the next generations and with the Earth).However, the main keyword is dialogue, as \u201cthere are only two ways to organize human relationships: dialogue or violence\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 17). In Part 2, Flecha explains not only the responsibility of sociology to be a good listener to citizens and other disciplines but also how society can also enter into dialogue with the knowledge produced by sociologists. Flecha qualifies this knowledge as unachieved, and it is such not only because of the uncertainty of some results but also because the very dialogue is an inherent part of scientific knowledge production, i.e., with dialogue this knowledge will be achieved. This dialogue would not be possible without the connection between, from one side, what Bruno Latour called research as a cold domain and, from the other, truth, goodness, and beauty; thus, Part 3 is about this connection, which I consider part of the current ethical turn in sociology. The last part is how citizens will like and use the sociology he advocates.Before extending my summary, I would like to qualify my reading of this great book. My interest in this book comes from my research agenda in the last six years, making three calls: The first was in my candidacy speech for the International Sociological Association (ISA)\u2019s presidential election, calling for global sociology with specific qualifications; the second was in the middle of my mandate as ISA president, for connecting sociology (more broadly, social sciences) to moral philosophy; and the third was my call in Melbourne for dialogical sociology. When Ram\u00f3n Flecha gave me his book last December, I was positively surprised to discover that we had not read each other before but had both reached the same eagerness for dialogic/al society and sociology, even if we don't have the same focus.Let me review five of the themes developed in this book: conceptualizing dialogic society; dialogic sociology as a methodology; gender; social impact; and finally classical, contemporary, and democratic sociology.Flecha has many justifications for his call for a dialogic society, one of which is that there is a clear demand from people for dialogue. Those who donate to humanitarian organizations request accountability and dialogue about how the resources have been used. Following Erik Olin Wright's Real utopias, Flecha discusses the participatory budget in the city of Porte Alegre, Brazil (which became a model for many municipalities), Wikipedia, and the Mondragon Cooperative as examples of eagerness for dialogue. Employing more than 81,000 people in 2019, the Mondragon Cooperative is considered \u201cthe most dialogic group of successful companies worldwide\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 37).Yet in the social sciences, dialogue was not always respected. Flecha understands dialogue (dia-logos) in the line of the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, for whom \u201clogos [is] to be the principle that guides the evolution of everything. From this original and holistic conception, dialogue includes all human dimensions like reason and desire\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 53). Yet, there are two types of reductionism of the \u201clogos\u201d: the Apollonian rational one (Apollo is the Greek sun god linked to reason and order), represented mainly by Kant and the philosopher of language John Austin (speech acts) and the Dionysian reductionism of passion and emotion (Dionysus is the Greek god of wine and dance), represented by Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault. For example, Flecha criticizes the Apollonian reductionism of Habermas, whose communicative acts privilege reason through language. For him, Habermas's conception of rationalized communicative acts in the public sphere miss friendship, love, sex, and envy as components of communicative humans. Flecha, with his colleagues and particularly Marta Soler Gallart, develops this further and enhances Habermasian communicative acts theory by strongly introducing the power dimension and the feminist approach (remembering the gender orientation). They distinguish between dialogical communicative acts and power communicative acts. They thus refer to dialogue in terms not only of words but also of body language (gestures, looks, caresses).For Flecha, dialogic society should combine the beauty of the arts, the truth of science, and the goodness of human rights, which are intertwined with each other: \u201cWithout science there are no human rights; the rights to health, to education, and all the others can only be real with the contribution of scientific discoveries. Without human rights, science has strict limitations. The benefits of the discoveries do not reach everybody; they do not reach those excluded from human rights\u201d (p. 79).One of Flecha's central theses is how he connects these three realms. For him, the first two (ethics and truth) need consensus, while the latter (aesthetics) does not. Yet this raises the problem of the freedom to choose ugliness: \u201cThe freedom to live in ugliness is neither a right nor a freedom when it becomes an imposition of ugliness on people who want to exercise their right and their freedom to live in beauty\u201d (Flecha, 2022, pp. 90\u201391). Controversies arise, for example, when some cling to ugliness as part of their memory. He defends, as socio-neuroscience did, the possibility for a dialogic reconstruction of our memory so \u201cwe do not need to be slaves of our ugliest past events if we have had them. We can decorate the rest of our lives with precious moments and relationships\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 91).How to overcome the ugliness that is often promoted by commercial products? Flecha brings an example of dialogic gatherings of literature, paintings, music, and other arts. Experimental gatherings were successful in Barcelona, where they were attended not only by the middle classes but also by the lower classes. This dialogic encounter is the antithesis of how Richard Serra conceived of his famous metal wall in Barcelona. For Flecha, \u201cParaphrasing \u2018L\u2019\u00c9tat c'est moi\u2019 by Louis XIV, some artists try to impose the idea \u2018L'art c'est moi\u2019 (The art is me)\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 97).Dialogic society requires dialogic sociology. For Flecha, dialogic sociology is not a theory as much as it is a methodology that has three features concerning the relationship to informants, collaboration, and research ethics.First, the communicative methodology implies an egalitarian dialogue between researchers and research participants from the very beginning in order to mitigate the power dynamics. The research center where this methodology was developed at the University of Barcelona is the Community of Research on Excellence for All (CREA). In CREA, power interactions are being replaced with dialogic interactions in order to generate consensus. In the case study of Roma people in Spain, for instance, researchers not only include Roma voices in the study but also engage with them in reflecting on the knowledge provided by the scientific community.Second, it implies more collaboration in the social sciences. Flecha rightly highlights that up to 60% of articles in the social sciences are already coauthored, and most research groups reflect gender and ethnic diversity. But he advocates more coauthorship with researchers from other disciplines. He brings up the example of neuroscience, citing the work of Ram\u00f3n y Cajal showing that it is social experience that changes the brain. As the plastic nature of the brain allows us to understand the different impacts of human relationships of varying quality on brain functioning and health, the social sciences are important collaborators for neuroscience. For Flecha, dialogic social science made in collaboration among different authors and disciplines can reach a much higher intellectual and scientific level than other social scientific efforts.Third, this methodology implies research ethics that goes beyond the classical focus on informants\u2019 consent to deal with the ethics of dialogue, such as the modesty of the researcher. Flecha discusses the example of J\u00fcrgen Habermas's The theory of communicative action, which contains a flawed interpretation of Austin's and Searle's speech acts theory. Despite Searle's corrections concerning Habermas's use of the concepts of locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts, Habermas refused in the second edition of his book to correct the errors or even to engage with Searle. Instead, he simply chose to ignore Searle's criticism.Flecha, like Marta Soler Gallart (2017), has used dialogic sociology to combat sexual violence in Spanish society. Both call for transforming oppressed traditional masculinity (OTM) into new alternative masculinities (NAM). Their CREA research team developed the NAM against bullying, gender violence, and other kinds of violence, including in the Spanish universities where a \u201ccode of silence\u201d was in place. Their research had a direct impact on changing policy in Catalonia and Spain on these issues.In line with this feminist approach, Flecha urges us to recognize new founders of sociology such as Jane Addams, the only sociologist Nobel Peace Prize laureate. He warns us that the historiography of sociology privileges certain founding (male/white/Euro-American) fathers and omits others\u2014what he calls invisibilizations. His appreciation for Addams comes not only from her sociological thought as a founder of the Department of Sociology in Chicago but also as a social activist and co-founder of Hull House. Hull House was Chicago's first social settlement, a place where immigrants and working-class people of diverse communities gathered to learn, to eat, to debate, and to acquire the tools necessary to put down roots in their new country.1 Addams described her activities in terms of \u201cthree Rs\u201d: Research, Residence, and Reform. For Flecha, \u201cthe social impact of her project was much bigger than the social impact of Durkheim and Weber together\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 87). Addams contributed to reforming many laws at the time of the great transformation of the New Deal in the Roosevelt era.Flecha, like all the research team members at CREA, does not conceive of research in terms of publishing academic papers in refereed journals only read by some peers but as engaging with society. He uses an example from an EU conference titled \u201cScience against Poverty,\u201d2 where a critique was voiced against science that just offers diagnoses of poverty without investigating the success of actions with the aim of overcoming poverty. Flecha quotes a participant in the conference: \u201cInvesting 3 million euros for research on poverty is only justified if researchers can present evidence that, with their studies, poverty will decrease more than if the 3 million euros are given to the poor themselves\u201d (Flecha, 2022, p. 90).Ram\u00f3n Flecha characterizes the main legacy of sociology by the fact that it serves humanity and has always been in collaboration with other disciplines. He gives an example of how sociology can help us to realize some objectives of humanity like the Sustainable Development Goals. Sociology has been instrumental in providing research for addressing poverty, social inequality, and social cohesion.While classical sociology (e.g., that of Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx) in the early 20th century set not only the research agenda but also the theoretical foundations, contemporary sociologies have been elaborated under the social disruptions related to Nazism, Stalinism, colonialism, civil rights, and feminist and gender movements. For Flecha, Parsons dedicated all his life to seeking to consolidate democracies against the risks of Nazi or Stalinist dictatorships. After classical and contemporary sociologies, within the current 21st century's scientific revolution, for Flecha, we witness an accelerated elaboration of democratic sociologies coming from diverse countries, cultures, genders, ideologies, and perspectives. For him, this is evidenced by the public sociology of Michael Burawoy, the multicultural feminism of Fatema Mernissi, the real utopias of Erik O. Wright, and the social impact of Marta Soler Gallart. Along with Flecha, Soler Gallart recently developed very heuristic thoughts on how to deal with Habermasian rationalistic public sphere deliberation regarding validity claims. For her, this concept has \u201cthree limitations that are overcome by using the concept of dialogic relationships, which includes (a) placing claims in social structure, (b) considering the ethics of responsibility, and (c) accounting for both feelings and desires in the analyses\u201d (Soler Gallart, 2017, p. 142).Despite my general agreement with the thesis of Flecha's magisterial work, I have three concerns related to how some of his critique is offered in a heavy-handed manner, the way he connects an author's thoughts with an author's life, and, finally, his over-optimism about the spread of democratic sociology.I fully agree with Flecha that some scholars have impoverished social sciences with affirmations and theories that are not the result of sound empirical research but rather driven by ideology. In this line, he criticizes not only Marx and some Marxist sociologists for their vulgar materialism but also the reductionism in the theories of Pierre Bourdieu and James Samuel Collen. Yet readers will sometimes notice that Flecha engages in heavy-handed criticism against some sociologists in an unjustified manner and without proper contextualization. Let me give two examples.First, Flecha considers the result of the literary gathering experiment in Barcelona, being attended by all social classes, as a counterexample to Bourdieu's work on distinction. The concept of distinction captures a trend of how each social class constructs its artistic and leisure tastes, and this should be understood as a significant statistical association and as a result of his fieldwork in the early 1970s, a time when the theory of social reproduction was salient in giving the working class more rights. Therefore, the success of the literary gathering does not necessarily undermine the heuristic value of Bourdieu's theory. The second example concerns Coleman. For Flecha, \u201cColeman confused correlation with causation, and from the reality that most rich students obtained results than most poor they that was not for overcoming (Flecha, 2022, p. Flecha not read the of the the of his the limitations of more resources into without the of the where the is to this was in more civil and rights for the so he want to the poor but to them. the the same limitations to to the and for the in without addressing the of their of beauty of the is among other to the for the of human rights. Flecha considers the case of a people to between art and or \u201cthe author's and \u201cthe author's He criticizes such using the example of to Flecha, the of and (Flecha, 2022, p. 87). from being a sociologist to being a which in and He also criticizes the relationship between as of and the In the same he criticizes who his All these are calls not to engage with the work of these this is much more as I a direct between the author's thoughts and the author's We need to that scholars have some and for and in both we need to this and not their thoughts I consider the of truth, goodness, and beauty in research as a that can be used to the work of a by to that many scholars were of Durkheim, and are so even the case of J\u00fcrgen Habermas is as he has a to theories of and as as for both democratic and the ethics of and he when it to the right of for He the Research at the University of which is without for what in He has been about what is in the a fact of which I became when I in the early in a I was by his at that His of rights is thus not simply a of interest in Habermas as a human being and his we have to deal with his thoughts and dialogical communicative I would Michael and them to of some thoughts of a from his of intellectual i.e., some of us will focus on a contribution to while others will focus on his of that is, humanity has developed a conception of different from what it was in the and what we is ethical be considered in the engage with Habermas's dialogical communicative even if I with his on that, I can some the of all the with the project were just so and to from what we call the In that Habermas is just simply being a good would use the same to deal with Heidegger, This should also be to and and public so that we what can be considered good while their in particularly of their good example be the of in where they to each of a an their in the I would this approach the of from the at the University of It was to it in of the who from this in It was that was by and We will this of by or or the such a on the work of Flecha and Soler Gallart, I that the thought of is and be used but for instance, his concept of is the of rightly Parsons and Habermas, among we that to the need for dialogue and on the of between people and groups of different ethnic and This is also by both of the Yet is our sociology I dialogic sociology is much than Flecha For a good part of sociology does not the of the conception of the In a I that the of the of the social sciences sociology to the and of our can be as but called this by and this of to impose a and conception of the good while social is not a problem for sociology rather, it through many of public life, including the and the problem of is present not only in the but also in the to a of global like Flecha and Soler Gallart, call for dialogical sociology, and I that they are more than me and they its rightly in the work of their research center in Barcelona and I by sociology being dialogical is to its to civil society so to into two is the level of where sociology scientific research that is important for public deliberation in society by different groups in civil society, or This the possibility of providing knowledge to or organizations that we don't agree at all the has to what is as social including the of is understood social is through and in a given society. this level is the level of where sociology not only engages with civil society but also a in of groups against the and certain to sociology.

      "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to examine Habermas\u2019s account of the transformation of the public sphere in modern society. More specifically, the study aims to demonstrate that, whilst Habermas\u2019s approach succeeds in offering useful insights into the structural transformation of the public sphere in the early modern period, it does not provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding the structural transformation of public spheres in late modern societies. To the extent that the gradual differentiation of social life manifests itself in the proliferation of multiple public spheres, a critical theory of public normativity needs to confront the challenges posed by the material and ideological complexity of late modernity in order to account for the polycentric nature of advanced societies. With the aim of showing this, the paper is divided into three sections. The first section elucidates the sociological meaning of the public/private dichotomy. The second section scrutinizes the key features of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere by reflecting on (i) the concept of the public sphere, (ii) the normative specificity of the bourgeois public sphere, and (iii) the structural transformation of the public sphere in modern society. The third section explores the most substantial shortcomings of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere, particularly its inability to explain the historical emergence and political function of differentiated public spheres in advanced societies.",

A response to some of these other critics will appear in the fall issue of Perspectives, the newsletter of the ASA theory section, and another response, to an essay review by Bryan Turner, will appear in a forthcoming issue of Citizenship Studies.2 \"Much of contemporary political science,\" Elizabeth Clemens relates, \"has refuted just this framing, arguing that political actors can be understood as consistently rational, but honest, cooperative and trustworthy only when it advances their self-interest,\" and she concludes by complaining (or exclaiming\u2014it is hard to tell whether she is being ironic or not), \"yet Alexander rejects this standard assumption of political theory.\" It seems to me, however, that rat choice in political science, or sociology for that matter, validates rather than falsifies the theory of civil binaries that I have proposed. In fact, not only does rat choice confirm the distinctively binary nature of lay and philosophical thinking about democracy and politics, but it quite neatly fits into one of its sides. A theoretical version of what I call the tradition of Thracymachus it offers the kind of narrow instrumental approach to rationality that Socrates attacked in Plato's dialogues\u2014concerned with means, not ends; aggressive, not cooperative; manipulative, not straightforward; and without consideration for the values of others, unless such concern is to serve our side.3 Two articles I published on the Watergate crisis (CitationAlexander 1984, Citation1988) straddle the pre- and post-semiotic divide. The first was organized around the universalism/particularism contrast, while the second proposes the idea of more complex sets of binaries, although not yet the idea of the discourse of civil society. The notion of cultural discourse as a relational language built on self-generating antonyms bears a family resemblance, not only to the late Durkheim and semiotics, but also to Foucault's post-structural understanding. In History of Sexuality, Foucault maintained that the Victorian discourse of repression was paradoxically implied by the anti-Victorian discourse of sexual liberation, such that the latter was not, in fact, \"repression free.\" My sense that the discourse of civil society is similarly divided, that it similarly interpolates each side with the other, led me to adapt Foucault's notions of a simultaneously repressive and \"liberating\" discourse from the sexual to the political scene. All of this is recounted in The Civil Sphere and elsewhere in the publications that are cited there. My point is that the discourse of civil emancipation also speaks the language of exclusion, often doing so with the heartfelt intention of protecting democracy from its enemies and even, sometimes, from itself. It can hardly be the case, then, that I conceptualize the codes of civil society, pace Antonio, as fostering \"uncontested integration.\" This is Habermas' discourse ethics, not mine.4 I also noted CitationBaiocchi's (2006) research on the emergence of the discourse of civil society in Brazil's transition from authoritarianism and CitationHeins' (2006) on how the civil binaries have distorted some recent European intellectual discourse about America. For a historical investigation of the codes as structuring class conflicts in late 18th-century London, see CitationDavis (2007).5 At one point, Antonio implies that, while the quotations reproduced in The Civil Sphere do suggest binarism, they do not display the actual language terms that I attribute to the discourse of civil society. If this were so, it would certainly be a telling critique. I believe, to the contrary, that each quotation contains one or more of the civil binaries that compose the broader culture structure. This, at least, was my selection criterion for including a quotation. I briefly considered italicizing the actual items of the civil language inside each quoted text, but I decided this would be unnecessarily didactic and disruptive.6 As evidence for his assertion that \"the connection between Alexander and Parsons is transparent,\" Antonio suggests that my \"strong claims\" about the civil codes actually \"stand in for Parsons' evolutionary\" theory. My discussion in the text above explains why this is not true. From the time when I first conceptualized these binaries as coded languages, I saw them as standing in marked tension, if not, in fact, as refuting, Parsons' cultural theory; when I conceptualized the irredeemable contradictions of the civil sphere, I understood myself to be falsifying the evolutionary optimism of modernization theory in general and Parsons' social and historical work in particular. My strong sense that Parsons had papered over the contradictory tensions between the subsystems (for him, AGIL), and overemphasized their complementary, was already very much part of Theoretical Logic, informing most of the second half of the fourth volume of that book (CitationAlexander 1983). As I developed my civil sphere theory, I devoted a large chunk of the concluding chapter of Neofunctionalism and After (CitationAlexander 1997) to a critique of Parsons' understanding of \"societal community.\" More recently, in a more polemical essay (CitationAlexander 2005b), I demonstrate how Parsons' commitment to evolution allowed him not to face the dark sides of modernity, but to pretend, instead, that contemporary American society either had already, or was about to, fulfill itself in an ideal way.7 In his powerful and disturbing book, CitationJames B. McKee (1993) has shown how just such a delegitimating binary distorted the history of American sociological studies of race, typically reducing African Americans to creatures without the capacity to participate in modern society in order to explain, if not to justify, centuries of white rule. In an article building upon McKee, CitationMorris (2007:529) describes these \"prescientific assumptions\" in binary terms and attributes to them great symbolic power: \"They led White sociologists to formulate two contrasting sociological populations: Whites were civilized, endowed with agency, and superior; blacks were subhuman, bereft of agency, and inferior.\"8 Indeed, my point in stressing the centrality of mutual recognition and misrecognition is not only empirical but moral. Only by insisting on widespread human capacity can we avoid the simplifying dichotomies upon which civil restrictions rest. If we fight a revolution that dichotomizes humane friend and inhumane foe, how will we create a human and inclusive society afterward? Who will educate the educators, as Marx once asked? The 20th century is strewn with the rotting carcasses of would-be liberators\u2014revolutions built upon dichotomizing rhetorics that have refused to recognize the humanity of fellow human beings.9 It is just such a philosophical anthropology of recognition that Hegel laid out in Phenomenology of Mind and that, via Hegel, informs such contemporary philosophers as Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth. For a critique, see CitationAlexander and Lara (1996).10 The transformation of the form of women's organizations from \"womanly\" clubs to more impersonal business models, which Clemens documents in her book, The People's Lobby (CitationClemens 1997:184\u2013234), illustrates how one of these nontraumatic pathways of change facilitated the civil incorporation of women. While emphasizing organizational repertoires rather than cultural structures, Clemens implicitly evokes a performative understanding, writing that \"by adopting techniques not traditionally associated with feminine activity, women sought to present themselves as legitimate political actors\" (p. 207, italics added), and noting how, in the newly adopted organizational forms, \"cash served both as a symbol of citizenship and as a medium of centralization\" (p. 213). In her critical comment, Clemens acknowledges that in \"cultivating greater communicative capacities and political development,\" even the more conservative first-wave feminists \"deployed multiple substantive identities [that] can be arrayed as a series of overlain binaries in order to suggest a powerful, structuring, underlying code.\" I agree with Clemens that the continuing evocation of civil binaries neither reinforced purely traditional inequalities of gender nor introduced postgender criteria for evaluating women as citizens\u2014which is precisely why, throughout my historical reconstruction of the shifting relation of gender and civil sphere, I employ the concept of \"compromise formation.\"11 At various points in The Civil Sphere, I directly challenge Morris's (1984) account in theoretical and empirical terms, for example, footnote 33, pp. 637\u201341, where I also contest other instrumentalist explanations, including the emphasis on the Cold War and claims that white accessions at Birmingham and elsewhere were responses simply to local white businessmen's fears over profit loss (see below).12 In Sociology and the Race Problem, McKee argues that the racist distortion of black capacities (see note 7, above) explains why, before the 1960s, white American sociologists either dismissed the possibility for reform or adopted a paternalistic, white man's burden position. \"A people so culturally inferior,\" McKee explains, \"would lack the capability to advance their own interests by rational action.\" As blacks were \"viewed as lacking a trained and experienced leadership, as still ignorant and mostly uneducated,\" they were portrayed \"as incapable of participating in the political process.\" In other words, the failure to recognize black agency \"was a logical extension of this image of the American black\" (CitationMcKee 1993:8). Only with the antiracist reconstruction of the white political imagination, which was both cause and effect of the civil rights movement, could this serious misunderstanding begin to change, and white American sociology commence to give the power and the resources of the black civil sphere their due. In the final pages of The Civil Sphere's analysis of the civil rights movement, I speculate that the significance of black agency in the contemporary project of civil repair has, perhaps, still not been fully appreciated: \"Despite the periodic calls for regulatory intervention made by liberal intellectuals and policy elites, the conditions that sustain the racial underclass will not be repaired until a new social movement can arise. Only a powerful and affecting social movement could mobilize the increasingly fragmented black community. Only skillful movement intellectuals could translate the particular experiences and conditions of the racial underclass into compelling codes and narratives that can gain psychological identification from the civil sphere outside. Social scientists and critics speak about repairing this new racial divide primarily in organizational terms, calling for massive state intervention and economic restructuring. However, such new forms of regulation depend on the creation of new forms of civil power\" (The Civil Sphere, p. 390).13 That, nonetheless, throughout much of the decades-long backlash period, civil repair of racial (and gender and sexual) inequality actually gained momentum demonstrates the manner in which regulative institutions of civil society respond to communicative restructurings of social solidarity, and not simply to the strategic maneuverings of election fights. This momentum did not, however, ameliorate the problem of the racial underclass.14 It is, in fact, the central importance of these northern media, not the fact that some of their best reporters were of southern origins, that is the central point of Roberts and Klibanoff's The Race Beat. This position actually provides the dramatic conclusion of their book, where they draw from their interviews with John Lewis, the Congressman and former movement activist: \"When he looks back on how he survived and how the movement kept going, he thinks about how hard the segregationists worked to keep the prying eyes of the press away. He can recall the security he felt when reporters\u2014'sympathetic referees,' he calls them\u2014were watching and the fear he felt when they weren't\u2026. When he saw white thugs in Montgomery smash cameras, beat reporters, and rip up notebooks, he understand that there was an extraordinary power of communications operating parallel to, and intertwined with, the movement. It was, he felt, an allied force[:] 'There was a sense of righteous indignation on the part of the American people because of the message that the media was able to translate and send around the country and around the world'\" (CitationRoberts and Klibanoff 2006:407). Lewis is speaking here, of course, only about northern media. Roberts and Klibanoff document how southern media, with a few notable exceptions, \"threw their whole editorial weight\" behind the backlash that developed against the black movement in the South (p. 74).15 All following quotations from CitationTavernise (2007).",

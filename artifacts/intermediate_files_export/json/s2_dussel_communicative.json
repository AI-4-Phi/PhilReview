      "abstract": "Indonesia is a country whose government system is run with a democratic system. Pancasila, \u200ewhich is the foundation of the state, contains the principle of democracy. The main principle of \u200ethe Pancasila-style democracy is deliberation to reach a consensus based on noble knowledge \u200eand wisdom. This principle of deliberation is in line with Habermas's thesis of communicative \u200eaction but also has different implications. This paper compares the concept of deliberation-\u200econsensus ala Pancasila and Habermas's communicative action in implementing a democratic \u200esystem. This qualitative research analyzes data that includes historical literature, philosophy, and \u200escientific articles that discuss discourses related to Pancasila and Habermas's theory of \u200ecommunicative action. The study results show differences in Eastern and Western culture in the \u200etwo discourses. In Pancasila deliberation and consensus, communal ties are very strong, while \u200ethe value of Western individualism in rationalizing a discourse becomes the color of Habermas' \u200etheory.\u200e",

      "abstract": "Abstract This essay aims to identify the potential contribution that a theoretical perspective based on sociomateriality can offer to organizational studies based on J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 concepts. We work specifically with one of the theoretical strands that contemplate sociomateriality - New Materialism based on Barad - and with the most recurrent Habermasian concepts, such as communicative action, the public sphere, worlds of life, and the system. We identify that Habermas\u2019 theoretical work is open to dialogue with the sociomaterial perspective and outline a framework highlighting the main points of convergence and divergence between Habermas and Barad\u2019s proposals, specifying the possibilities for integration. Overall, the analyses argue that it is possible to incorporate sociomaterial perspectives into empirical studies involving the Theory of Communicative Action and the main related ideas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \nHabermas\u2019s theory of communicative action is highly relevant as a philosophical foundation for upholding human rights, emphasizing the intrinsic value of each individual, which must not be eliminated by any power. This is supported by Article 6 paragraph (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified as Law Number 12 of 2005. Critical theory, a school of philosophy, focuses on liberating human knowledge from transcendental and empirical oppression, critiquing ideologies that perpetuate social oppression. Human rights have become a dynamic issue in Indonesia, especially during the Presidential Election, with widespread discussions at national and international levels. Countries, organizations, and individuals are increasingly voicing concerns about human rights issues. These problems are complex, particularly in resolving and sanctioning perpetrators, leading some to view human rights as \u201cmerely theoretical.\u201d Applying critical theory is crucial in this context, as perfected by J\u00fcrgen Habermas. This research employs normative methods, including statutory, conceptual, and case approaches. It concludes that J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action and John Locke\u2019s natural law are similar, emphasizing the inherent meaning of external rights. This grounding makes Habermas\u2019s theory important for upholding law and human rights internationally, although its implementation remains ambiguous. \nAbstrak \nTeori kritis tindakan komunikatif Habermas sangat relevan sebagai fondasi filosofis penegakan HAM yang menekankan nilai intrinsik setiap individu, yang tidak boleh dihilangkan oleh kekuasaan mana pun, sesuai dengan Pasal 6 ayat (1) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights yang diratifikasi menjadi Undang-Undang Nomor 12 Tahun 2005. Teori kritis adalah aliran filsafat tentang pembebasan pengetahuan manusia dari segala bentuk penindasan transendental dan empiris. Ide teori kritis adalah kritik terhadap ideologi yang bertujuanmenyadarkan manusia akan penindasan sosial dan mencoba membebaskannya. Isu HAM menjadi perbincangan dinamis di Indonesia, terutama pada saat pemilihan presiden, serta di dunia internasional. Berbagai negara, organisasi, dan individu menyuarakan sudut pandang HAM yang ada. Problematika HAM sulit diselesaikan dan penerapan sanksi bagi pelaku sering dianggap \u201cteorik belaka.\u201d Penerapan teori tindakan komunikatif ini penting terkait HAM karena disempurnakan oleh J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan, konseptual, dan kasus. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan adanya kesamaan konsep antara teori kritis J\u00fcrgen Habermas dan aliran hukum kodrat John Locke, yang menekankan hak-hak lahiriah. Teori J\u00fcrgen Habermas menjadi penting untuk penegakan hukum dan HAM di dunia internasional, meskipun penerapannya masih ambigu.",

      "abstract": "This article investigates the state of extreme mechanization in modern industrial societies, which leads to a strict separation of various domains of life and an eventual exclusion of the human element. The Frankfurt School philosophers, Herbert Marcuse and J\u00fcrgen Habermas in particular, have rigorously analyzed the inherently ideological function of technology in late capitalist societies. Similarly, Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano depicts a near-future America, reflecting an exceedingly technologized and automated social world under corporate capitalism. This paper examines how the technocratic state in Vonnegut\u2019s novel utilizes technology to pacify and nullify masses, and thus challenges the idea that technology is just a value-free collection of know-how. The devalued human subject and dehumanized society portrayed in Vonnegut's anti-utopian narrative are discussed with reference to Marcuse\u2019s notion of 'one-dimensional society' and Habermas\u2019s theory of 'communicative action' to provide the critical framework for the analysis of the impoverishing and colonizing impacts of technological rationality on the lifeworld.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The world is deeply connected through narratives, which enrich its stories and meanings. Tales about others and us bring vibrancy to life, making existence more dynamic. Critical Discourse Studies analyse these narratives, with the Discourse Historical Approach being a prominent method. This approach emphasises the centrality of narratives while integrating elements like comedy, tragedy, irony, and romance, as suggested by Frye. Such integration not only enhances causality, an essential aspect of textual analysis but also ensures that other essential features like conflict remain significant. By combining social dimensions with storytelling, this approach offers a more profound understanding of narratives. Habermas's theory of communicative action plays a vital role here, enhancing the semantic depth of the Discourse Historical Approach. It provides a solid foundation for analysing genres and narratives, making the process more authentic and insightful. Together, these methods create a robust framework for exploring how stories shape meaning and enrich discourse.",

The guiding question of the essay is: does the transition proposed by Habermas from other rationality types to the communicative concern an interparadigmatic theory or a paradigmatic leap? Methodologically, we adopted the conception of an essay according to which authors and readers need to recognize that reality can be understood in different ways. The discussion, contextualized in public administration, allowed us to understand that considering the communicative action theory as having an interparadigmatic character does not mean it is a mere gathering of other theories because it surpasses those it dialogues with, additionally presenting a radical shift. We propose that the Communicative action theory comprises a paradigmatic leap with interparadigmatic characteristics. Finally, we present implications of this discussion for Public Administration.",

This claim, which is at the core of his social theory as a whole, requires an analysis of the conditions for reaching an agreement in communicative action. In this regard, Habermas provides the most detailed analysis of these conditions from the linguistic perspective in his article: \u201cWhat Is Universal Pragmatics?\u201d This article discusses Habermas\u2019 linguistic justification for the Theory of Communicative Action through an elaborative reading of \u201cWhat Is Universal Pragmatics?\u201d",

Socio-environmental issues are increasingly urgent for society to make a commitment to efficient solutions in the direction of reversing the serious problems of destruction of the planet and the impossibility of a dignified life on earth. It all depends on an awareness of all the citizens of the world in order to face this civilizational crisis. However, any path that is pointed out will not succeed if the altered course of society and nature co-evolution is not resumed. This means that only with a deeper understanding of socioecological issues on the part of humanity will it be possible to rediscover the lost link of the harmonious coexistence of Homo sapiens with the other lives that make up the terrestrial globe. This understanding is very present in Agroecology, an emerging science that was born from the criticism of the unsustainable way of using nature's goods and the fragmented way imposed by modern science on knowledge. His option for the dialogue of knowledge, when contemplating traditional and academic knowledge, has been providential to raise the relationship between society and nature to more sustainable levels. This has been done in dialogue spaces such as culture circles and conversation circles. However, with the complexity of the phenomena, other spaces for dialogue have emerged in the field of Agroecology. This is the case of the dialogue circle, complexity based on dialogic action and communicative action.",

Data processing uses descriptive analysis with a deconstruction paradigm, looking more sharply to provide new and critical meanings to the interpretation of Habermas's thoughts. The text is understood and rearranged from a different point of view. After finding the philosophical foundation and structure of Habermas' thought, the researcher compares his thoughts to the concept correlation of the Leadership of the Prophet Muhammad SAW so as to find Habermas' intentions related to Communicative Action and the rational development of society. The results of this study prove that Habermas's idea has a similar concept to Islamic spiritual leadership in a brief conceptualization that reflects the character and values that adhere to humanity, equality of emancipatory values and prioritizing communication in deliberation and solidarity that can lead to great ideals Naturalism is welfare in Habermasian Communicative Action. The spiritual implications of Islamic leadership are addressed using a democratic method and prioritizing the social side so that it has a purpose for the development of society.",

A need for more \u201ccommunicative interaction,\u201d and explicative and practical discourse, is illustrated by two empirical examples of medical decision making which reveal both communicative and discursive deficits (Section I). To empower and enable the patient as a rational and autonomous speaker and discourse participant, a Habermasian emancipatory argument and \u2018the power of the better argument\u2019 is recalled (Section III). The possibility of equal communicative and discursive rights in the light of real inequalities is discussed in the context of a \u2018competence gap\u2019 between participants (Section IV). Further sections focus on the importance of informed consent on the side of the patient and the communicative competences as an important factor of healthcare system.",

This study relates to how the Pela concept within the Maluku community has a broad influence on the rationalization of the life-world. Modernity, liberalism, and the currents of globalization that fuel technical progress can jeopardize the rationalization of our life-world, which is essential for the integrity and solidarity of society, but neglect of technological progress should not be a proposition. Therefore, researchers, with the help of the dialectic of Habermas and Hardiman\u2019s thoughts with their post-secular thoughts, found a motive to examine how Indonesian multiculturalism has the potential to rationalize the development of society. Using the perspective of Jurgen Habermas and Hardiman based on post-secular theory, the purpose of this study helped researchers study the forms of deliberation from the Pela system. Qualitative research is the research method used. The critical paradigm is the chosen solution. This study combines Pela concepts associated with Habermas and Hardiman\u2019s post-secular thinking and uses Habermas\u2019 critical hermeneutic theory. The results of this study show the decision-making process. In this context, the researchers found the Pela concept as the initial capital of the Maluku people to support technical progress without neglecting the roots of solidarity. This research can be a reference for further researchers in sociology, ethnology, and even human resource management.",

We discuss how layers of reflexivity (self, interpersonal and collective) have a role in communicative relationality (trust and shared decision making). We propose cross-cultural communicative relationality is strengthened by three key researcher actions; inner listening, relational actions beyond discourse and collective knowledge, along with Habermas criteria for discerning the motivations of action (communicative vs strategic). This article provides researchers from a variety of disciplines a way to respectively research in the critical paradigm while considering Aboriginal ways toward building a relationship that is mutually beneficial.",

Habermas\u2019 theory of communicative action, identifying three functions that communicative action can perform: to be used to convey information, to establish social relationships with others, and to express one\u2019s opinions or feelings. By analyzing the category of \u201ccommunicative rationality\u201d with religious issues in the public sphere, in relation to language, discourse ethics, it is shown that the public sphere is the environment where dialogues in all areas take place to meet the needs of citizens. (According to Habermas, Kant was the first philosophy to give to public sphere \u201cits completed theoretical structure\u201d in a text of political philosophy, entitled \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d). \nReligions may not directly influence politics, but still, have the function of directing in society. J. Habermas determines that religion cannot be restricted to the private sphere, but must actively participate in the public sphere, where interactions and dialogues take place, as a catalyst for the process of solidarity to exist, to bring a new life force to the world. It is the place for members of society to have conversations and engage with each other. \nThe theory of communication by J. Habermas is timely contemplation with a deeply humane spirit.",

I will focus on her arguments that touch on the role of rationality. Allen's critique of Habermas will be presented, especially where she argues that focusing on rationality is ethnocentric and promotes the political exclusion of subaltern groups. The extent to which Allen's critiques affect the emancipatory potential of Habermasian theory will next be assessed. It is finally argued that Allen's position leads to a denial of the distinction between social rationality and irrationality as legitimate criteria. The consequences of such a position for the political sphere will then be analyzed.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract From a decolonial perspective, Habermas\u2019 theory is seen by many as Eurocentric and in philosophical alliance with colonial rule. In particular, his theory of progress is seen as offensive because it devalues non-Western ways of understanding in comparison to their modern Western counterparts. On the one hand, this is true. On the other hand, Habermas\u2019 actual concept of progress can also be used to formulate a critique of colonialist development imperatives. Moreover, his concept of \u201csystematically distorted communication\u201d can make an interesting contribution to understanding colonial rule: even colonial rule is communicatively mediated, with the constant risk of dissent precariously held in check by racist discourse barriers. Fanon already provides strong starting points for this communication-theoretical view of colonial rule. With him, the decolonial struggles against racist discourse barriers also come into view.",

Public discourse and the CHE report present an emerging clarion call for the academy to critically engage the question of decolonisation of the curriculum. This paper proposes Transmodernity as a methodological endeavor towards engaging African epistemologies in an effort to find alternatives in teaching various intellectual property law concepts. To tease out the fundamental decolonial question of how the dismembered can be re-membered, the paper tests the theory of Mohlomism and its applicability to the intellectual property law curriculum. Mohlomi was a mentor to the king of the kingdom of Lesotho, Morena Moshoeshoe I. He would travel around Southern Africa teaching society about his philosophy of truthfulness, justice, peace, the love of man and for sane humanism. Re-membering the Being of the proverbial \u201cother\u201d, reverses the effect of the prevailing legacy of epistemicide in the curriculum and may gradually lead to a transformed legal pedagogy. The paper discerns decolonisation as a project that inter alia seeks to create a pluriversal intellectual community that embosoms the epistemic traditions of the global South.",

I then offer a preliminary sketch of what I call \u201caffective alternatives,\u201d which could convey ways of life different from the hegemonic social forms that globalization promotes and imposes. At the very least, affective alternatives present a parallax: seen and felt from the perspective of the alternative, globalization is not taken as neutral, normal, irreversible, or desired; rather, it is \u201cdistorted\u201d into globalization/coloniality, a project to be resisted. I conclude with reflections on connecting and deepening coalitions of resistance.",

      "abstract": "The paper argues on the Latin-American philosophy as a decolonial praxis which unveils and overcomes the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity (such as Max Weber and J\u00fcrgen Habermas). This historical-sociological blindness is characterized (a) by the separation between European culture and the modern Realpolitik of the colonialism as non-dependent and non-mutually-supported moments, and (b) by the reconstruction of the process of constitution of the European modernity as an endogenous, self-referential and basically internal movement of evolution, ignoring again its correlation and profound linking with colonialism. The paper argues that the critical and emancipatory role of the modernity\u2019s normative paradigm only is possible by that historical-sociological blindness. So, the Latin-American philosophy, the moment it denounces and unveils the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity, points directly to the self-restraint of the modernity\u2019s normative paradigm as the basic theoretical-political agenda and praxis for a decolonial philosophy, as condition also to the correction of the modernity itself. Contrarily to Habermas, who defends the renewal of the modernity\u2019s normative paradigm as a non-fundamentalist epistemological-moral universalism, the decolonial philosophy will show that the historical-sociological blindness only can be resolved from the self-restraint of the modernity and from an anti-colonial politics based on the reparation for colonialism as a critical-normative concept for theoretical analysis and political praxis regarding modernity-modernization as a totalizing epistemological-cultural-societal movement towards colonialism.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

      "abstract": "This article makes explicit a hidden tension between post-Marxism and decolonial studies, which points to a challenge for intercultural dialogue. While post-Marxism seeks to rehabilitate a universal foundation for the construction of truth claims\u2014a universal already formed within Western modernity\u2014the decolonial critique seeks to dismantle all universals connected to the myths of modernity and therefore demands a departure from the standpoint of the cultural periphery. In fact, Alain Badiou and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, like other post-Marxists, have been rather critical of the standpoints articulated by decolonialists who strive to include cultural differences and marginalised identities in the process of knowledge production, but the reality is that the decolonial critique, more so than post-Marxism, is well-supported by the historical evidence, thus demonstrating the need for Enrique Dussel calls a \u2018transmodern pluriverse\u2019 in the academic world. In pursuit of diffusing this tension between the post-Marxists and the decolonialists, this article calls for further investigation in terms of determining if real dialogue is possible between these two trajectories of thought.",

      "abstract": "Some academic circles in Latin America support the idea that the main purpose of a \u201cdecolonial theory\u201d is to denounce eurocentrism. Such circles also argue that \u201cdecolonization\u201d of social sciences, art, and philosophy consists in the recovery of the ancient knowledge of indigenous and afro-descendant communities. Finally, they state that the purpose of a critical theory \u201cpursued in Latin America\u201d would consist in denying any aspiration for universality. In this paper, I would like to present some arguments that question such positions. First, I will ask if it is possible to consider cultural identities within particularism. Then, I will address the issue of eurocentrism in order to clarify to what kind of phenomena this term might apply. Afterwards, I will address the issue of universalism by showing that emancipation politics cannot give up the gesture of the universalization of interests. In the end, I would like to express some thoughts concerning the idea of \u201ctransmodernism\u201d, which was developed in Latin America by the Argentinian philosopher Enrique Dussel.",

Wolfe\u2019s book \u201cEurope and the People Without History\u201d and Dipesh Chakrabarty\u2019s \u201cProvincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference\u201d. Critics address positivism, eurocentrism, progressivism, and stadial history, which Chakrabarty refers to as \u201chistoricism\u201d. In the first part, the author explains the meaning of Chakrabarty\u2019s concept of \u201chistoricism\u201d and summarizes Wolfe\u2019s description of conventional history, which fits in this concept. The second part focuses on the various elements of their criticism. In the third part we present quotes that showcase how both scholars strive to write history outside of the confines of the historicist paradigm.",

      "abstract": "This essay argues for the need to provincialize memory studies concepts of the third phase. Memory studies and postcolonial studies share several characteristics, such as their historical emergence, interdisciplinary foundation, and interest in knowledge production. I suggest that postcolonial critique may further enrich memory studies through Dipesh Chakrabarty\u2019s concept of provincializing Europe, because it may help memory studies to confront a tendency to universalize and naturalize some of its concepts, including cosmopolitan, multidirectional, and transcultural memory. A critical historical analysis of these concepts demonstrates that they are not so much universal, as they produce margins and exclusions. Analyzing Tracey Sankar-Charleau and Jude Charleau\u2019s Trinidad and Tobago Carnival performance Lady Solanaceae Ligahoo, I argue that it is important to move beyond universals to also consider cultural memories\u2019 historical specificity. Otherwise, memory studies may risk neglecting countless fugitive memories on the margins of societies, cultures, and histories.",

The theoretical texts I discuss include Pheng Cheah\u2019s What Is a World?, Darieck Scott\u2019s Extravagant Abjection, and Dipesh Chakrabarty\u2019s Provincializing Europe. I retrieve the distinction in these works between the structural dislocations that \u201cfound\u201d human being and decompose linear time, and more properly historical decenterings in which the heterotemporal is an effect of social processes of exploitation and (colonial-capitalist) domination. To honor this distinction, I place recent thinkers into dialogue with Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse, suggesting that a post-poststructuralist reclamation of the latter is particularly overdue. The article culminates in an explication of Zo\u00eb Wicomb\u2019s David\u2019s Story\u2014a work that asks us to live through its form that postcolonial mode of the nonsynchronous with which my argument is concerned.",

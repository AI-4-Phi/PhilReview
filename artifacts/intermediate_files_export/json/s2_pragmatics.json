      "abstract": "The subject matter of this article concerns the interpretation of texts and statements of an aesthetic nature in the light of pragmatics, i.e. as aesthetic speech acts. The author treats aesthetic speech acts as stimulating ones, which are opposed to both representative acts and determinative acts (especially, directive ones). A characteristic feature of stimulating speech acts is their persuasive nature, i.e. such a language action that induces and encourages the addressee to experience emotions but does not influence them in a volitional way. Aesthetic reactions are self-steering and do not depend on the subject\u2019s will. Therefore, the realization of aesthetic speech acts, in comparison with other acts, is specific: it is not possible to use specialized (lexical or grammatical) exponents of the illocutionary function, e.g. performative verbs. To perform the aesthetic function, various elements of the plan of content and the plan of expression are used, which suggest the aesthetic intention of the sender: 1) the semantic content of the text or utterance; 2) its form and structure; 3) context and communication situation; and 4) translation of text/message, including the media. Due to their functional and formal features, aesthetic speech acts are divided into several subtypes: 1) macro-, meso- and micro-acts; 2) free and complementary acts; and 3) communicative and non-communicative acts.",

Collin singles out Robert Merton as an advocate of a division of labor that avoids this conflict by delimiting the sociology of science to deal only with the social framework and genesis of science, leaving it to philosophy and epistemology to investigate the justification of truth value and demarcation criteria. In this article, I will focus on Merton\u2019s cudos norms and illuminate their meta-theoretical basis through the inclusion of Habermas\u2019s ideas about rationality, the \u2018ideal speech situation,\u2019 his formal pragmatics, and his use of rational reconstruction. I discuss whether this can be considered \u2018naturalized philosophy.\u2019",

Habermas\u2019s rational-reconstructive project to explicate the intuitive rule-consciousness held by competent speakers retains immense theoretical value for analyzing both partisan and mass political discourse, if his emphasis on isolated speech situations is supplemented with a logic of communicative memory better accounting for how disagreement antecedes discourse on the formal-pragmatic register. I argue that Habermas\u2019s concept of the \u201clifeworld\u201d contains untapped theoretical resources for thinking about the formal-pragmatic consequences of accumulated partisan experiences; namely, how such experiences lead inter-partisan actors to jettison mutual imputations of communicative accountability. I conclude by offering revisions to Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics. Rapport-building intended to alleviate the negative effects of prior accumulated partisan experiences is first necessary if a norm is to enjoy real justification.",

First, the formal pragmatic analysis of communicative rationality and practical rationality in post-metaphysical thought will be introduced, as well as post-conventional justification and the validity of moral norms oughtness. Then, the cognitive content of morality will be outlined through the elaboration of the principle of universalization (U) and the principle of discourse ethics (D). The co-originality will be discussed in the sense that the Principle of Democracy is derived from \u201cD.\u201d The complementarity relationship will be examined based on how Morality, in light of the Principle of Universalization (U), provides normative content in terms of universalizable reasons to Law, while Law addresses its cognitive, operational, and motivational deficits. Positive law and post-conventional morality are thus the main mechanisms of social integration in modernity, as they permeate the structural components of the lifeworld. Finally, the relationship between these mechanisms should be one of complementarity; otherwise, Law, which is known to be constituted in the tension between facticity and validity and, therefore, always mutable, risks losing its capacity for social integration and expectation stabilization.",

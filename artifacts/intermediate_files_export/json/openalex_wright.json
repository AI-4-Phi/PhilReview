      "abstract": "This article explores the doctrine of self-defence within the context of the challenges directed at the imminence requirement, from the perspective of both national and international law. The article will attempt to illustrate that the requirement of imminence underlines the political character of the self-defence doctrine wherein private force may only be resorted to in the absence of institutional protection. This study will argue that the imminence rule can not merely be regarded as a \"proxy\" for establishing necessity; rather, the elements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality are inextricably connected to ensure that defensive force is only resorted to when national or international authorities are not in a position to prevent an illegal aggression, and that the defensive lethal force is not abused.",

      "abstract": "The religious right often aligns its patriarchal opposition to same-sex marriage with the defence of religious freedom. In this article, I identify resources for confronting such prejudicial religiosity by surveying two predominant feminist approaches to same-sex marriage that are often assumed to be at odds: discourse ethics and queer critical theory. This comparative analysis opens to view commitments that may not be fully recognizable from within either feminist framework: commitments to ideals of selfhood, to specific conceptions of justice, and to particular definitions of secularism. I conclude by examining the \"postsecular\" turn in feminism, suggesting that we can see the same-sex marriage debate not in terms of an impasse between differing feminist approaches, but in terms of shared existential and ethical affinities.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;It is argued that the contemporary era is one proliferated with moral panics (Thompson, 1998). This is just as the concept of moral panic, which has enjoyed nearly forty years of analytical purchase, is being \u2018rethought\u2019 with an impetus to connect its processes with developments in social theory. Underpinning this rethink is a primary question: what are moral panics extreme examples of? It is evident in the literature, however, that there is a varying degree to which a more longstanding question \u2013 why moral panics occur \u2013 is addressed as part of this rethink. I propose in this thesis that these questions are intimate with each other; that only by understanding why real episodes occur can a supposition of what the concept of moral panic is in an abstract sense begin. Another \u2013 related \u2013 proposal is that while the conjectural question remains elusive the approach to empirical cases of moral panic be in real-type/ideal-type terms. That is, that at the same time as the concept is employed to understand phenomena occurring in tangible social situations, a reflection upon the concept (the ideal-type) is undertaken in relation to how the real-type case under investigation challenges and/or supports its interpretative parameters. To demonstrate these relationships and their study, I examine in this thesis the case of \u2018killer kids\u2019, which emerged in 2002 and spanned across the sociopolitical landscape of Aotearoa/New Zealand for the next six years. At the heart of this case was a set of news images of a child, who at twelve years of age had been involved in a heinous crime resulting in the death of pizza delivery person Michael Choy. Seeking to understand how and why these images were fundamental to how this \u2018real-type\u2019 episode of moral panic unfolded in this space and time, I employ a two-component approach inspired by Norman Fairclough\u2019s (1995a) Critical Discourse Analysis. The first component deconstructs the realtype case via a three-tiered analytical framework: content, process, and context. The second component reflects upon these tiers (in parts and as a whole) in relation to Stanley Cohen\u2019s (1972) application of a \u2018cycle of deviance amplification\u2019 in addition to the stages of panic as described in his seminal work Folk Devils and Moral Panics. From the processual and contextual factors identified at play in the construction of \u2018killer kids\u2019 I conclude with a suggestion that moral panic can be thought of as a set of appetites that come together in an explosive discharge of excess energy.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "This essay identifies a social phenomenon that the Russian-Jewish novelist and war correspondent Vasily Grossman calls \"senseless kindness.\" Emerging without prior warning from certain face-to-face encounters between human beings, the striking reversal of preferences that characterizes this phenomenon can be used to cast a critical light on the practices of Cost Benefit Analysis (\"CBA\"). Not only does senseless kindness highlight the troubling theoretical problem of determining the \"correct\" ex ante\u2014the point in time at which CBA measures people's preferences\u2014it also points towards the possibility of a more general critique of CBA's indifference to how preferences are formed and expressed. The essay shows that CBA ignores the concrete experiences of everyday human sociality and communicative action by modeling them in all instances as \"transactions costs\" to be reduced or avoided rather than celebrated, or at least studied for their meaning. Missing from CBA is any sense that the face-to-face encounter between human beings is, or can be, a moment of both individuation (of the participants) and transformation (of their preferences), in which genuine freedom and politics, in the largest senses of these words, are first made possible. Obsessed with what preferences are, CBA ignores the question of how they emerge. The result is not just a partial and partisan view of the possibilities open for human decision-making, but also a technique that puts the validity claims of individual preferences beyond all question and rational deliberation. Skeptical or afraid of government's ability to change culture, certain scientistically-minded decision makers are happy to rely on techniques such as CBA that purport merely to reflect information about \"what the people want.\" However, CBA does not in fact \"reflect\" preferences as they are; instead, it constructs them as they would be if the entire meaning and value of human reason were reduced to purely instrumental (means-ends) calculations on the basis of correct technique, and if (per impossible) all contexts of people's life histories in concrete forms of life were somehow removed. Purporting to be a descriptive science of what people just happen to prefer, in many instances CBA's theoretical model actually produces a peculiarly asocial account of what their preferences ought to be.",

      "abstract": "The majority of instructional communication research identifies the main goal of instructors and effective teaching as securing teacher control and student compliance.Traditional instructional communication research decontextualizes student misbehaviors by eliding deeply emotionally invested issues of race, culture, socioeconomic status, and gender.This study explores how this decontextualization is a result of a rationalistic framework that marginalizes oppressed groups.Using a method of rhetorical criticism on instructional texts for graduate teaching associates, this study identifies four key representations of rationalistic discourses across these texts: advocation for decontextualization within the classroom as an attempt to omit emotion, suppression of negative emotion within the classroom, controlling of emotion through rationality, and a disregard for graduate teaching associates' subject position as a productive liminal space.Since these findings can influence GTAs' future careers as educators, this study concludes by considering the broader implications of these representations of rationalism for both students and teachers.research, the students these instructors teach, and the society in which all teachers, students, and researchers co-exist.More specifically, in this thesis, I will explore how the seemingly benign construct of rational thought is transformed, within the context of education, into an often-oppressive ideology of rationalism, which urges, unreflectively, for a \"thinking of the world apart\" (Palmer, 2007, p. 64) through attempts to isolate and control for variables, specifically emotion, within the classroom.What makes this perspective troublesome, however, is that students are not beakers filled with various chemicals; they are human beings in flux-collections of varying life experiences.Science may be able to isolate the components and contents of different substances, but this practice becomes abusive when, as researchers and instructors, we rely on logic and reduction to understand, manipulate, or \"solve\" the varying degrees of turmoil or joy a student or teacher brings with her or him into the classroom.Within science, \"solutions\" come as this not that, black not white, plus not minus.While these dichotomies are helpful and necessary to the scientific community, to computer systems, and to mechanical processes, they transform into false binaries, misnomers, and placards of rationalism and its ills when placed in the context of the classroom-a world that requires the ability to think not in either-ors but both-ands.This crucial ability-so lacking within rationalist educational discourses-is reflexivity.My hope is to contribute to a more nuanced dialogue within instructional communication that is not focused on teacher versus student or student compliance versus student disruption as independent and dependent variables of an equation, but rather explores how all of these factors exist in productive, unavoidable, and meaningful",

      "abstract": "Recently, literary critics and some historians have argued that to use the language of separate spheres is to \"mistake fiction for reality.\" However, the tendency in this criticism is to ignore the work of feminist political theorists who argue that a range of ideologies of the public and private consistently work to mask gender inequalities. In Keeping Up Her Geography, Tanya Ann Kenedy argues that these inequalities are shaped by multiple, but interconnected, spatial constructions of the public and private in US culture. Moreover, the early twentieth century when key spatial concepts \u2013 the nation, the urban, the regional, and the domestic \u2013 were being redefined is a pivotal era for understanding how the public-private binary remains tenaciously central to the defining of gender. Keeping Up Her Geography shows that this is the case in a range of literary and cultural contexts: in feminist speeches at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, in middle-class women\u2019s urban reform texts, in southern writer Ellen Glasgow\u2019s novels, and in the autobiographical narratives of Zora Neale Hurston and Agnes Smedley.",

      "abstract": "The present Article proposes, via consideration of a contrast between two classical accounts of dialectical reasoning, that the employment of \"public reason,\" in substantive due process analysis, is unworkable in theory and contrary to more reflective Supreme Court precedent. Part I of this Article raises a number of issues for consideration relating to the epistemology of law and focuses especially on the concept of public reason and its critique. Part II addresses alternative approaches to legal reasoning suggested by classical accounts of practical reasoning and virtue theory and considers the operation of such legal analysis outside the area of substantive due process; Part III analyzes post-Lawrence case law confirming the dilemma created by the Supreme Court's ambiguous approaches to substantive due process and concludes that only one interpretation-that articulated fully in Washington v. Glucksberg and given lip service in Lawrence v. Texas-provides a method for resolving novel substantive due process challenges that is philosophically sound as well as historically coherent. Rather than perpetuating a fiction that denies the propriety of lawmaking unless based on principles that all citizens can rationally agree upon, an appropriate model of substantive due process analysis recognizes that law must inevitably be based upon principles that cannot be agreed upon by all citizens in virtue of rationality alone.",

      "abstract": "This thesis provides a critical examination of four approaches to democratic inclusion. These approaches are: egalitarian theories of deliberative democracy, identity politics and its post-structuralist critics, and integrative approaches. The thesis presents each approach as a successively more effective way of addressing democratic exclusion. Each theory is measured against the demands of accommodating the claims of groups that have suffered some form of historical exclusion and injustice. The thesis explains the significance of the demands of historical injustices in relation to these approaches and concludes that deliberative democracy and the politics of recognition require supplementation by a politics of reconciliation. Drawing on the idea of reconciliation from conflict resolution and international relations, the thesis explores the way in which democratic inclusion can be supplemented. The politics of reconciliation is fundamentally crucial for the task of accommodating demands of historically excluded social groups primarily because of its emphasis on confronting the past, acknowledging injustices, taking responsibility and offering an apology for causing these injustices and embracing the concrete and specific experiences of historical oppression and exclusion. Briefly, the distinctiveness of reconciliation stems from its serious engagement with the specificities and particularities of real and concrete experiences of historical oppression and exclusion. The originality of this thesis lies in providing a supplement to and therefore transforming the politics of recognition and deliberative democracy and their ability to address political problems of excluded social groups. This thesis does not aim to replace deliberation and recognition with new substitutes but seeks to offer a new interpretation of these theories and supplement them with reconciliation. Briefly, the thesis offers a new interpretation to familiar issues in different disciplines and the novel task has been to bring them together. The application of the ethic of reconciliation, from International Relations and conflict resolution, to the politics of recognition and deliberation makes a significant contribution to the field and the opening of a new research agenda for normative theories of democratic inclusion.",

Personal Zines bieten einen einzigartigen, halb\u00f6ffentlichen Raum f\u00fcr subkulturelle autobiographische Narrative. Ihre Analyse erm\u00f6glicht die Privilegierung individueller Subjektivit\u00e4t und spezifisch geographisch und sozio-kulturell verorteter biographischer Prozesse. Personal Zines sind das Resultat einer langen Entwicklung eines speziellen pers\u00f6nlichen Mediums, das seit sp\u00e4testens den 1990er Jahren dem Ausdruck eines auf kultureller Differenz und Distinktion begr\u00fcndeten expressiven Identit\u00e4tsverst\u00e4ndnisses dient. Anhand von Theorien narrativer und performativer Identit\u00e4t wird dieser Prozess erl\u00e4utert. Meine Betrachtung neuer Formen diffuser politischer Organisation basierend auf kollektiver Identit\u00e4t und gemeinsamer Kultur der Beteiligten tr\u00e4gt eben dieser wachsenden Rolle von Identit\u00e4t im postmodernen Politikverst\u00e4ndnis Rechnung, nicht nur im subkulturellen Bereich. In den untersuchten Personal Zines l\u00e4sst sich die Verschr\u00e4nkung politischer Werte und Selbstidentit\u00e4t als Grundlage politischer Praxis im allt\u00e4glichen Leben nachzeichnen.",

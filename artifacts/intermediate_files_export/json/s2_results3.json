      "abstract": "Throughout her work, Seyla Benhabib develops a consistent reflection on equality and diversity within a globalized context. Beginning with Critique, Norm, and Utopia (1986), she critiques classical critical theory for its reliance on negative critique and abstract utopias, lacking grounding in real normative practices. In Situating the Self (1992), she introduces a feminist and postmodern ethical approach, while The Claims of Culture (2002) explores the balance between equality and cultural diversity. Her work evolves into a theory of democratic cosmopolitanism in The Rights of Others (2004), advocating for universal human rights that transcend national borders. She challenges Kantian universalism and communitarian views like those of MacIntyre, proposing an ethics of responsibility rooted in contextual particularities. In Transformations of Citizenship (2001), she analyzes how globalization reshapes citizenship and belonging. Benhabib also critiques contemporary democratic theories, arguing that Habermas\u2019s deliberative democracy and Mouffe\u2019s agonistic model fail to fully embrace inclusivity. She proposes instead a more participatory and inclusive democratic framework. Furthermore, Benhabib emphasizes Hannah Arendt\u2019s ambivalence toward modernity, highlighting the importance of action and plurality. This paper argues that a unifying thread runs through Benhabib\u2019s work, tying together her reflections on rights, equality, and diversity. Using critical analysis of her writings, the paper demonstrates how Benhabib\u2019s evolving conception of rights aims to integrate inclusive practices, respect for universal norms, and constant legal revision to address the demands of a diverse global era.",

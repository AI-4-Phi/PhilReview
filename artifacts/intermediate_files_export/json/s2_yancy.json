      "abstract": "Among topics in educational theory and philosophy, race and racism have been extensively developed in recent years. Despite public contestation about the continued relevance of race, most scholars in educational philosophy and theory regard a deepening understanding of race and racism as critical to enhancing equity in the future. This review considers how race and racism have been conceptualized and theorized within educational research to benefit youth and society. First, it gives a global picture about how race has been and is conceived in educational and other social theory. It links scholarship on race and racism to important global phenomena related to white supremacy, imperialism and colonialism",

This article offers a series of observations on defining racism in relation to Kantian philosophy, how much we have yet to learn from interdisciplinary scholarship, and how our attachment to philosophical rigor may have made us complicit in white supremacy.",

      "abstract": "Over the last three decades, considerable debate has surrounded Immanuel Kant\u2019s views on race. However, these discussions often revolve around the question of whether Kant himself was racist or not. In contrast, in this article, we propose to address the question of race philosophically, explicitly and systematically relating it to Kant\u2019s critical work. In doing so, we will show the following: First, it will become evident that Kant\u2019s engagement with race can only be fully comprehended within the context of his teleological theory, wherein he interprets nature as a purposive whole facilitating the realization of freedom. Since Kant understands this teleological theory as the completion of his critical work, it occupies a key position in his philosophy\u202f\u2013\u202fturning race into a philosophically meaningful concept. Second, thereby it becomes understandable why Kant\u2019s concept of race, although initially introduced within the framework of his natural philosophy, acquires a deeper meaning that extends beyond the boundaries of nature into the realm of culture, denying non-white people the ability to participate in the actualization of reason. Finally, we will conclude by advocating for an alternative form of teleological judgment that can serve as a means to criticize racism, rather than legitimize it.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines Pierre Hadot\u2019s philosophy as a way of life in the context of race. I argue that a \u201cway of life\u201d approach to philosophy renders intelligible how antiracist confrontation of racist ideas and institutionalized white complicity is a properly philosophical way of life requiring regulated reflection on habits\u2014particularly, habits of whiteness. I first rehearse some of Hadot\u2019s analysis of the \u201cway of life\u201d orientation in philosophy, in which philosophical wisdom is understood as cultivated by actions which result in the creation of wise habits. I analyze a phenomenological claim about the nature of habit implied by the \u201cway of life\u201d approach, namely, that habits can be both the cause and the effect of action. This point is central to the \u201cway of life\u201d philosophy, I claim, in that it makes possible the intelligent redirection of habits, in which wise habits are more the effect than simply the cause of action. Lastly, I illustrate the \u201cway of life\u201d approach in the context of anti-racism by turning to Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff's whiteness antieliminativism, which outlines a morally defensible transformation of the habits of whiteness. I argue that anti-racism provides an intelligible context for modern day forms of what Hadot calls \u201cspiritual exercises\u201d insofar as the \u201cway of life\u201d philosophy is embodied in the practice of whites seeing themselves seeing as white and seeing themselves being seen as white.",

      "abstract": "In the early hours of Christmas Eve, 2015, George Yancy, Emory Professor of Philosophy and regular contributor to theNew York Times online forum The Stone, published a toughlove letter titled \u201cDear White America.\u201d There, in the spirit of the season, he presented white people with what he called a \u201cgift\u201d by asking them to challenge the common sense of their privilege and the inherent racism that shapes their existence. The letter quickly went viral. The volume and vulgarity of hate mail Yancy received in return over the next year-plus resulted in the publication of Backlash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America. While Yancy performs deep analyses of some of the very worst of those emails, letters, and voicemails, the book also serves as an exegesis of sorts for \u201cDear White America,\u201d a second offering of the gift somany readers refused the first time. Indeed, Backlash, like the original letter (which is reprinted in the book), sets out to engage Yancy\u2019s white readers who consider themselves non-racist and expose to them the depth and pervasiveness of white supremacy. Throughout the book, in fact, Yancy directly addresses \u201cwell-meaning,\u201d colorblind white progressives as \u201cyou, white reader.\u201d Further, he directly quotes passages of the hate mail and threats he received in the wake of publishing \u201cDear White America,\u201d arguing that they are representative of the country\u2019s normative white racism rather than anomalies uttered by far-right extremists. Backlash is part philosophical analysis, part personal reflection, and\u2014ultimately\u2014a call to white Americans across political and professional spectrums to acknowledge their complicity within structures of violent racial oppression that affectively and physically determine the everyday lived experiences of people of color. A prolific writer, Yancy\u2019s previous publications on the philosophy of race and critical whiteness studies have, like \u201cDear White America\u201d and Backlash, provocatively engaged some of themost contentious, polarizing, and, thus, least-discussed issues involving racism in whitestream U.S. culture. His 2012 collection of essays Look, a White! (Temple University Press) is one of the more notable examples. Before \u201cDear White America,\u201d Yancy was not only a frequent contributor to The Stone but was regularly invited to",

      "abstract": "This article argues that any antiracist initiative that continues to rely on upholding the colonial fiction and practices of human \u201craces\u201d merely repackages Eurocolonial domination. Drawing on decolonial theory, epistemic-justice scholarship, African and Africana philosophies of relation, and the togetherness Wayfinder framework, the HARMONY model, and Justice AI GPT, we demonstrate how contemporary antiracism frequently reproduces the very hierarchies it seeks to dismantle while presenting alternative pathways toward a future without racism. We synthesise perspectives from Sheena\u202fMichele\u202fMason, Shayla\u202fSima\u202fDube, and Christian\u202fOrtiz to outline a paradigm that lends itself to the abolition of the belief in and practice of race, and thereby racism itself, without erasing culture, lineage, or collective struggle. Our contribution is fourfold: (1) a brief genealogy of \u201cracelessness\u201d in African and Africana thought, (2) a critique of epistemicide and \u201cwhite-comfort engineering\u201d that co-opts liberation discourses, (3) an exposition of \u201cracelessness\u201d as the logical endpoint of antiracism, and (4) a practical roadmap for reclaiming identity and creating a future without antiblack racism through land, language, and lineage.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Questions and analyses centered on race have become more prominent in philosophy. By employing a \u2018critical philosophy of race\u2019, thinkers become enabled to address how race and racism continue to operate in subtle and unintended ways, including within concepts, theories, principles, practices, and methodologies otherwise purported to be race-neutral. Yet, North American sports philosophy provides few examples of work that grapples with race, racism, or theories of race. In this essay, I ask why and conclude that the shortage of discussions that include explicit references to race or ethnicity in North American sport philosophy is due to the dominance and normalization of white epistemologies \u2013 white ways of experiencing, seeing, and knowing the world.",

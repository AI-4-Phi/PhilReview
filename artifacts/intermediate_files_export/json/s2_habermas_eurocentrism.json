      "abstract": "As a female political philosopher, born in Turkey to a Sephardic Jewish family, educated in America and Germany, and enjoying an illustrious teaching career in the United States, Seyla Benhabib has long pondered the limits placed on the validity of transcendent ideas by their contextual genesis. This \u201claudatio\u201d for the Adorno Prize she was awarded in 2024 by the city of Frankfurt examines her work, with its special debts to Habermas and Arendt, as an evolving attempt to explore this issue with special reference to the challenges of feminism, postcolonial anti-Eurocentrism, the populist assault on democracy, and the global refugee crisis. Her defense of cosmopolitan ideals against ethnonationalism and abstract universalism shows that transcendent ideas can have particular genetic origins.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines the shift in direction of the Frankfurt School following Stephan Lessenich\u2019s appointment as director of the Institute for Social Research (IfS) in 2021. A key innovation introduced by the current research program at the IfS is a substantive critique of the Eurocentrism embedded in the Frankfurt tradition. The heterodox impulse championed by Lessenich can be situated within the broader evolution of the critique of Eurocentrism in Western social sciences. This evolution comprises three phases: emergence (i), expansion (ii), and ascent to prominence in academia in the Global North (iii). Then, the article explores the underlying causes of the significant resistance to moving away from a Eurocentric framework. This study proposes that Lessenich\u2019s intellectual leadership is guiding the Frankfurt School toward a paradigm shift, which is taking shape through the development of a new vision of society that incorporates the intellectual traditions and historical realities of the Global South.",

      "abstract": "Postcolonial theory has been at the forefront of attempts to remedy the problem of Eurocentrism. This article argues that postcolonial theory has not progressed far enough in successfully treating the problem of Eurocentrism, for it has not sufficiently abided by its own methodological underpinnings, i.e., it has not satisfactorily developed its own critique of the \u201cpresentist\u201d conceptions of history. More precisely, postcolonial theory has not shown how to make a complete departure from the methodologically presentist conceptions of capitalism, which, in turn, limits our ability to overcome hierarchical readings of global modernity. To problematize and fill this gap, I take an unconventional tack, turning to a seldomly cited figure in debates on Eurocentrism: Karl Polanyi. I contend that although Polanyi places the origins of capitalist modernity in Europe, his historical sociology provides an alternative and more definitive solution for presentism and Eurocentrism. Polanyi\u2019s rejection of the \u201ceconomistic\u201d and \u201cdualistic\u201d understandings of human life, his insistence on the commonality and diversity of human degradation in the face of capitalist modernity, and his historically specific conception of the \u201ccounter-movement\u201d enable a decidedly non-presentist, non-triumphalist, and non-hierarchical narrative of the genesis and development of the modern present.",

      "abstract": "In light of the postcolonial critique of Eurocentrism, the epistemological foundations of sociology and the legacies of classical sociologists have certainly become controversial. Postcolonial critiques of sociology\u2019s Eurocentrism have denounced the \u201cparochial\u201d nature and limitations of the theoretical contributions left by Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, the reductive and stereotyping orientation of the \u201cprimitivist\u201d and/or \u201corientalist\u201d representations of non-Western peoples that can be identified in their work, and the incomplete and misleading accounts of the Western processes of modernization that we have inherited from them, which fail to fully address and satisfactorily account for the realities of modern Western forms of colonialism and imperialism. However, the nature and consequences of Durkheim\u2019s specific sociological Eurocentrism raise opposing views within postcolonialism. This article aims to evaluate the pertinence of the divergent and sometimes contradictory postcolonial appraisals of Durkheim\u2019s Eurocentrism by focusing particularly on the controversies generated by his sociological approach to religion. Placing Durkheim\u2019s sociological project within both the academic field and the socio-political context in which it took shape, this article highlights the shifting relevance and the implications of his evolving sociological approach to this object of study in his science of morals. Although it is not exempt from inconsistencies and Eurocentric assumptions, Durkheim\u2019s sociological approach to religion leaves an invaluable legacy for a non-dualistic sociological understanding of the rituals through which humans (re)create their social identities and their forms of belonging and solidarity. In line with the priorities of some postcolonial agendas, it can fully reveal its explanatory potential in the sociological investigation of modern and contemporary interethnic and racial conflicts and forms of colonialism and neo-colonialism.",

In doing so, this book challenges, more broadly, the view of critical theory as steeped in Eurocentrism, culturally conservative, and politically defeatist. Contesting this in four chapters,Postcolonial Historical Materialisminserts Adorno, Luk\u00e1cs, Bloch, and Benjamin into key contemporary sites of militancy and debate.\n Engaging with a wide range of European and non-European sources, Menozzi proposes a new concept of \u201cpostcolonial historical materialism\u201d, indicating how the heritage of critical theory can reopen global possibilities of utopia and revolution in a non-utopian age of global emergencies, social unrest, and the unfinished history of decolonisation.",

      "abstract": "Namita Goswami \u2019 s Subjects That Matter: Philosophy, Feminism, and Postcolonial Theory begins by identifying a common \u201c nonidentitarian value \u201d that feminist and post-colonial theoretical approaches share with philosophy, understood as an open-ended pursuit of wisdom: a deep sense of respect for the \u201c heterogeneity \u201d of our subject matter and for the complexity of existing beings (2). This heterogeneity overflows our human capacity to categorize in any kind of timeless way. As a tenet and a tool for our historical moment, this respect for heterogeneity is more urgent considering our planetary context and \u201c the extraordinary collapse of species-life and the destruction of the physical environment \u201d (2). As Goswami observes, \u201c climate change puts the lie to Eurocentrism as heterogeneity is the very basis upon which terrestrial life, human civilization, and human thought depend \u201d (3). In other words, Eurocentrism shows its homogenizing limits as the system that continues to prevent the historical (as well as conceptual) achievements of postcoloniality, while it also destroys the diversity of species-life for a short-term accumulation of resources in the so-called advanced West. Goswami suggests that we might productively thwart Eurocentric frames when we work to uphold our \u201c subject matter \u201d without clinging to inherited frames of reference, such as what \u201c properly \u201d counts as \u201c philosophy \u201d and other forms of disciplinary legitimacy in the Euro-US academy. Goswami \u2019 s book will be of interest to decolonial feminist researchers, scholars, graduate and advanced undergraduate students, especially those engaging Spivak \u2019 s question of subaltern speech, and/or those drawing insights from Frankfurt School critical theory to more recent feminist and/or postcolonial conversations, and/or those exploring critical animal studies, environmental philosophy, and other inquiries",

      "abstract": "Many postcolonial or critical scholars are rather sceptical of the Responsibility to Protect principle. In most of the critical literature, Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is presented as a product from the West, whose liberal ideal relies on a perception of Southern states being potentially dysfunctional, which in turn justifies an interventionist discourse with neocolonial overtones. The problem with this interpretation of R2P is that it essentially ignores non-Western, particularly Southern, inputs on the concept, falling precisely into the trap that, many authors claim, vitiates Responsibility to Protect: its West-centrism. Building upon a mix of critical, decolonial, postcolonial and Third World Approaches to International Law scholarship, this article proposes a number of additional steps to decolonize R2P in an effort to avoid what Pinar Bilgin describes as \u2018conflating the critiques of the particularity of universals with critiques of the idea of having universals\u2019. What successive decolonizing layers expose is a negotiation process in which the agency of states from the global South in shaping the \u2013 still controversial \u2013 principle has proved particularly obvious. Decolonizing Responsibility to Protect, this article argues, requires critical scholars to engage in a contrapuntal analysis in order to acknowledge the concept\u2019s mutual constitution by the West and the \u2018rest\u2019 and the deeper struggles over universals hiding underneath.",

      "abstract": "With global digitalization and the resulting intensification of communication processes, the accumulation and retransmission of ideas and their connotations have accelerated. The academic environment has changed in the course of updating the research field and building up a new picture of the world, complex and diversified. The accumulation of \u201ccritical mass\u201d of talented intellectual scholars based both in Africa and within the African Diaspora, focused on \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in philosophy and epistemology, was reflected in an attack on the theoretical principles of postmodernism and Postcolonialism and a dynamic transformation of the conceptual principles and content of African studies. Contrary to Eurocentrism, Africa has become an epistemological laboratory, where the developing theories claiming to become metanarratives, within which new metalexemes and metagenres are emerging. Postcolonial discourse contains elements of metascience, a universal system of knowledge production. The interrelation of facts and methodology in their framework fully corresponds to the trends of the time in the era of algorithms, and their choice both forms the mechanisms of scientific knowledge, but also ensures success in the fight against stereotypes, not only racial and ethnic. The theoretical and methodological significance of postcolonial studies refers to the actualization of the \u201ccrossroad\u201d problems in the history of Africa and the Diaspora, such as colonialism and decolonization, ethnicity and identity, hybridity and otherness, essentialism and transcendence, exodus and exile. In the present article the authors focus on the results of the interaction of researchers of African descent with postcolonial theory, as well as on the ideas of postcoloniality and decoloniality, which to a certain extent oppose each other. Particular attention is paid to the development of an updated epistemology of knowledge in the process of the formation of the \u201cpostcolonial library,\u201d which includes the works of many scholars from Franz Fanon and Leopold Senghor to Kwame Anthony Appiah and Achille Mbembe.",

      "abstract": "The figure of the intellectual has fascinated and mesmerized generations of thinkers, from Antonio Gramsci to Edward Said, from Michel Foucault to Gilles Deleuze, from Pierre Bourdieu to J\u00fcrgen Habermas, from Noam Chomsky to Cornel West, from Nancy Fraser to Gayatri Spivak, from Frantz Fanon to Stuart Hall, from Paul Gilroy to Rosi Braidotti, from Bruce Robbins to Helen Small and from Achille Mbembe to Judith Butler to mention but a few. The intellectual has also been studied from different disciplinary perspectives: political science, referring to the role of publicness and democratic influence; philosophy, concerning the question of truth and rhetoric; gender studies, concerning the divide between public and private and the visibility of feminist interventions; celebrity studies, concerning the role of charisma and stardom; (digital) media communication, concerning the role of new social media platforms and the authenticity, trust and accountability of news online; and postcolonial studies, concerning the question of individuality and collectivity in representing and speaking up for minorities, subalterns and marginalized groups. However, in my view postcolonial intellectuals are not only \u2018spokespersons\u2019, to avoid Jameson\u2019s definition of the postcolonial intellectual as an \u2018allegory of the third world\u2019. On the contrary, my take on the postcolonial intellectual is to revisit, deconstruct and rethink the category of the intellectual not as universal, individualistic and autonomous but as embedded in collective discursive practices and political engagements. This special issue draws from a two-day international conference that was held at Utrecht University on 5\u20136 February 2019. The conference, entitled \u2018Postcolonial Intellectuals and their European Publics\u2019, was organized to help launch a large new European research network called PIN (Postcolonial Intellectuals in Europe) for which I was the PI. The network is funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) in collaboration with several European partners, including prominent centres, institutes and departments in postcolonial studies (among others, the University of Leeds, University of Warwick and Newcastle University in the UK; Utrecht University in the Netherlands; the University of Lisbon in Portugal; Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice in Italy; Aalborg University in Denmark and INALCO in France).",

Arguing that reading, in the robust sense offered by Gayatri Spivak and Stuart Hall, is a necessary and urgent response to the question, the paper examines the interventions of three key figures for thinking radical black thought in our time, namely Achille Mbembe's Critique of Black Reason, Nahum Chandler's X: The Problem of the negro as a Problem for Thought, and Qadri Ismail's Culture and Eurocentrism. Through abiding by the stakes of the work of reading in this conjuncture, I argue that it is through resisting the easy route of cultural and relativized difference that the pedagogical work of reading, and teaching reading, for the future, becomes possible.",

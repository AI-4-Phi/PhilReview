      "abstract": "Foregrounding Said\u2019s critique of Western Oriental Studies, this paper attempts to explore how the willful misrepresentation of the Orient was employed by the West to generate the Rhetoric of civilization. Moreover, it also endeavors to bring forth how Said deploys Michael Foucault\u2019s notion of discourse and its relation to power, in order to destabilize and subvert the convention thoughts attached to Western Orientalism and uncover the \u2018power-knowledge\u2019 discourse in this apparently \u2018cultural field\u2019 of study. Being a qualitative study, the following paper would exploit Robert Irwin\u2019s novel The Arabian Nightmare to scrutinize the relation of the Occident with its Oriental counterpart. The research probing into the concept in detail, unearths the fact that Said\u2019s claim regarding the hidden agenda of Oriental Studies was not an \u2018amateur\u2019 claim but an audacious attempt at unveiling how the power discourses inherent in this academic discipline were used not only to generate, but to legitimize and perpetuate colonial rule in the Orient.",

      "abstract": "Orientalism (1978) is one of the greatest intellectual works of the last century in which Edward W. Said (1935-2003) challenges Western culture on account of its erroneous beliefs about the East. Orientalism, as Said describes, is not merely an academic field of study, but a way of thinking and a collection of beliefs which work together as a powerful tool to justify the colonial ideology. However, what Said suggests is not an anti-Western theory. In Orientalism, he interacts with a number of his contemporary intellectuals. This paper is a brief review of the influence of contemporary philosophers, thinkers and Western theories on Said\u2019s interpretation of Orientalism. The paper also attempts to discuss that how Said\u2019s Orientalism is related to the above-mentioned theories such as Gramsci\u2019s cultural hegemony, Foucault\u2019s notion of power/knowledge, Derrida\u2019s deconstruction, and Bakhtin\u2019s polyphony. Although this topic has been of interest to other researchers, further studies will contribute to the richness of the subject and can be used by students and scholars.\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Aijaz Ahmad has made serious critical interventions in Marxist and Postcolonialist readings of literature and culture. His book, In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures (1992) has made significant contribution to the postcolonial critical debates. It is a collection of critical articles with deliberations on postcolonial theory from different perspectives. In this book, one article on Edward Said discusses Said\u2019s contribution to postcolonial discourse in the paradigm of Western influence on Eastern cultural narratives. Ahmad argues that Said\u2019s critical writings on orientalism suffer from inconsistencies, overgeneralizations and selective applications. These methodological aberrations, Ahmad asserts, have shaped the trajectories of Said\u2019s critical oeuvre. He criticizes Said for adopting western theoretical models for the cultural analysis and interpretations which are deeply immersed in the capitalist power structures. Ahmad accuses him of appropriating the western knowledge-structures for theorizing the Orient. His analysis of Said goes beyond the limits of critical debates as he questions Said\u2019s vocation and space. He, in effect, considers Said an inauthentic critical voice. According to Ahmad, Said\u2019s successful career in the West has rendered him incapable of a genuine engagement with the Orient. In this paper, I have attempted a critical re-reading of Ahmad\u2019s arguments to suggest that Ahmad\u2019s criticism of Said is intentionally provocative, seeking attention without engaging with Said\u2019s theoretical perspectives in a comprehensive manner.",

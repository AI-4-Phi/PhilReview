This proposition rests on a reifying conception of modernity as a Eurocentric civilisational project which, I contend, is theoretically flawed and politically pernicious. I will trace this conceptualisation of modernity and some of the problems it involves in recent works of Arturo Escobar and Walter Mignolo. I argue that modernity is better understood as a politico\u2010theoretical toolkit that, while having no immanent ideological content, is vital to the analysis and critique of (neo)colonialism and imperialism.",

      "abstract": "In the last twenty years or so, decolonialism has claimed to be a more radical assessment of Eurocentrism than postcolonialism. Two distinct critical moves are at stake in this confrontation. Postcolonialism tries to rehabilitate non-European history in the development of the modern world, i.e. to conceive of Europe as a \u201cprovince\u201d among others (Dipesh Chakrabarty) and thereby to overcome a particularistic take on historiography and normativity. Only a complete account of modernity\u2019s entanglements throughout the world would result in true universalism. Decolonialism on the other hand argues that modernity is inextricable from its \u201ccoloniality of power\u201d (An\u00edbal Quijano). This is the source of the argument for a \u201cde-linking\u201d (Walter Mignolo) from Western epistemology and normativity. This paper presents these two strategies and discusses their consequences for European values, distinguishing their cognitive and non-cognitive levels. The last section of this paper presents a discussion of two authors that both critical frameworks engage, C.L.R. James and Frantz Fanon, studying their respective strategies of breaking with Eurocentrism. These different critical strategies seem better conceived of through the postcolonial framework, rather than the decolonial.",

      "abstract": "This debate piece offers a global historical materialist critique of decolonial theory, engaging Walter Mignolo\u2019s work. It argues that decolonial literature, by creating abstract universals like modernity/coloniality, disarticulates theory from specific social formations and historical contexts. The author proposes eight methodological questions to demystify decolonial literature and reintegrate theory into history. Using Mignolo\u2019s writings, the paper demonstrates how decolonial thinking can lead to political detachment and ineffective transformative strategies. The critique emphasises grounding theory in concrete social formations to render history legible and serve national liberation movements. By contrasting decolonial abstractions with historical examples from anti-colonial struggles on and beyond the African continent, it highlights decolonial thought\u2019s limitations in addressing capitalism as a world system. It advocates for a global historical materialist analysis that integrates capitalism\u2019s interconnected nature and reintroduces the social formation as a unit of analysis for understanding social relations.",

Walsh and Mignolo deconstruct how coloniality moves through liberal humanist scholarship, reinforcing the conceit of a transcendent, unified self.

The prompt for this as an interrogation of Oluwele\u2019s claim that an African feminist philosophy cannot develop until identifiable African worldviews that guide the relationship between men and women have been established. She argues that until there is general agreement about the nature of African philosophy itself, African feminist philosophy will remain impoverished. I critique this claim, unpacking Oluwele\u2019s argument, and examine the contested nature of both African and Western philosophy. Drawing from the work of Mignolo and decolonial thinking, I then argue for the possibility of \u201cepistemic disobedience\u201d concerning the emergence of an African feminist philosophy. Engaging with precolonial African examples which disrupt modern normative gender assumptions and looking at the project of decoloniality, I issue a call for an African feminist philosophy unfettered by the falsely universal claims of modernity/coloniality. My call is for an African feminist philosophy from African loci of enunciation, rooted in the epistemes and experiences of African women. \u201cMost thought-provoking in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking\u201d (Heidegger 1968, 6).",

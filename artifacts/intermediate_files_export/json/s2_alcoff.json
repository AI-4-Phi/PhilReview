She challenges the idea that gender is something we are born with. According to Butler, we form our gender through repeated actions influenced by social expectations. Her argument, based on feminist and philosophical concepts, questions the usual link between sex and gender. This paper explains Butler\u2019s points and further analyzes how these points relate to contemporary conversations about gender, identity, and self-expression. It also acknowledges some shortcomings in her argument regarding lack of attention to how race, class, and colonialism structure gendered experiences. Nevertheless, Butler's theory is still powerful and respectable in considering gender as something fluid, social constructed and participatory.",

      "abstract": "Bryan W. Van Norden\u2019s Taking Back Philosophy is a long-awaited and much-needed manifesto on multicultural curricula in the academic discipline of philosophy, which has up to now been stubbornly persistent in its monolithic approach to the teaching of its own self-defined genealogy, its origin, its methodology, and its very essence. As Van Norden points out, philosophy has a serious diversity problem. Only a handful of graduate programs have full-time faculty teaching non-Western philosophy. No other discipline in the humanities or social sciences, other than those specifically designated as Anglo-European area studies, has been so lopsided in its curricula and student makeup as the resolutely and decisively Anglo-Europecentered discipline of philosophy. Eighty-six percent of its Ph.D.s are granted to non-Hispanic whites. Compounding this Anglo-European identity is philosophy\u2019s phallic-centrism: among all the Humanities disciplines, philosophy has the lowest percentage of female doctoral students. Philosophy manages to graduate even fewer female Ph.D.s than math, chemistry, or economics\u2014a stunning revelation that the academic discipline of philosophy has a problem not only of cultural inclusion but also of gender inclusion to a much greater degree than other academic disciplines that are perceived as inherently \u201cmasculine.\u201d Faculty-wise, philosophy has not fared much better either; only about 20 percent of full professors are women, a figure that has hardly changed since the 1990s. Thus, to say that philosophy is in crisis is hardly an overstatement or feminist hyperbole. But the problem goes beyond that of just recruiting more minority students, hiring more female professors, or adding more non-Western philosophy courses. The problem is methodological and structural. With Van Norden\u2019s long-awaited manifesto, hopefully this is the time of reckoning for philosophy to take a critical turn. The claim that the practice of philosophy is specifically Western and Greek in origin and culture might sound intuitively correct to many, not just",

It analyses Rhys\u2019 aesthetics concerns in the creation of a subjective construction of the imperial metropole and the colonial space. In doing, this paper suggests how Rhys builds a bridge between contemporary modernist narrative techniques and a preceding Post-colonial perspective. The constant juxtaposition of time and place makes of Rhys\u2019 protagonist, Anna Morgan, an elusive self. By means of this fragmented self, the author aims to reformulate colonial power relations and raise crucial questions about discourses of gender and national identity. As a result, this paper engages in a Post-colonial thought, arguing how issues about gender and race issues are articulated in Rhys\u2019 novel. Rhys creates the subjectivity of a marginalized woman showing the effects of colonization and creating a metropolitan female identity based on fragmented and juxtaposed memories.",

      "abstract": "Toni Morrison\u2019s Song of Solomon, the protagonist Milkman, a middle-class black man, embarks on a coming-of-age journey to search for his southern roots. Having grown up under a patriarchal and materialistic environment, he witnesses the silencing of women in his family, experiences anxious competition for wealth and status within the middle class, and faces the persistent marginalization of his racial identity in a white-dominated society. This leads him to face multiple dilemmas concerning identity, desire, and relationships. Meanwhile, his quest to discover the ancestral roots in the South prompts him to reconsider ethnic history, social hierarchies and gender dynamics, sparking introspection and prompting him to reconstruct his sense of self and ethics. This paper adopts a postmodern ethical viewpoint that centers on the interconnected dimensions of race, class, and gender to dismantle the opposing binaries between white and black communities, dominant and underprivileged groups, and men and women in Song of Solomon. It explores how individuals can develop a moral conscience and sense of ethical responsibility in the face of differences, rebuilding ethical relationships through caring for the \u201cother\u201d. Furthermore, transcending the traditional oppression-resistance paradigm, the study emphasizes the ethical philosophy of \u201cembracing coexistence amidst differences,\u201d offering a new theoretical perspective through which to understand ethical dilemmas in complex reality.",

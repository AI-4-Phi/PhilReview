      "abstract": "This review of Amy Allen\u2019s book, The End of Progress (2016), first addresses the structure of the book and focuses on specific points made in individual chapters, including the affinity between postcolonial theory and the approaches of Adorno and Foucault in subjecting the notion of historical progress to \u201cwithering critique,\u201d and Allen\u2019s alternative approach to decolonization; Habermas\u2019 aim to put critical theory on a secure normative footing; Honneth\u2019s stance that the history of an ethical sphere is an unplanned learning process kept in motion by a struggle for recognition; Forst\u2019s attempt to reconstruct Critical Theory\u2019s normative account through a return to Kant rather than Hegel; and Allen\u2019s claim that her approach is fully in the spirit of Critical Theory and could be seen as continuation of Critical Theory\u2019s first generation, as in Adorno, and how it is a \u201cgenealogical\u201d approach that draws on Adorno\u2019s negative dialectics and critique of identity thinking, as well as on Nietzsche\u2019s conception of genealogy, as developed by Foucault. The second part of my response raises three issues: (1) Allen\u2019s partial compromise with the idea of progress; (2) whether critical theory would profit from engagement with other critical theories and theories of ethics, beyond postcolonial theory; and (3) nonwestern theories shed a different light on the question of Allen\u2019s critique, a theme that also draws attention to the gesture of decolonizing, the distinctions between colonialism and empire, and the sociology of knowledge production.",

      "abstract": "Beginning with the influential discussion of the dialectic of progress found in Amy Allen\u2019s The End of Progress, this paper outlines some difficulties encountered by critical theories of normative justification drawing on the early Frankfurt School. Characterizing Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s critical social theory as a dialectical reflection eschewing questions of normative foundations, I relate their well-known treatment of the dialectic of enlightenment reason and myth to their critique of capitalist society as a negative totality. By exploring the concepts of historical development used by Adorno and Horkheimer to describe both the progressive domination of capitalism, and the formation and cultivation of reflective consciousness, I trace the importance of progression and its inseparable relationship to regression in these early versions of critical theory. The dialectical social theory found here recognizes the persistence of social contradictions on both a methodological level and on the level of theory\u2019s development and expression, a connection potentially obscured by a division of historical progress according to its temporal orientation. Particularly in Adorno\u2019s later work, an opposition to the negative social totality requires notions of cultivation and learning which work against the prevailing forms of conceptual thinking, including the concern for the stability of rational foundations.",

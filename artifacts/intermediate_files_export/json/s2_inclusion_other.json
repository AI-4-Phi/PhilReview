After recalling Habermas\u2019s views on the public sphere, I present and discuss various objections raised by other critical theorists: Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nancy Fraser, Axel Honneth and Iris Marion Young. These criticisms insist on the paradoxically excluding effects of a conception of democracy that promotes civic participation in the public debate. Negt, Kluge and Fraser develop a Marxist line of analysis that question who can participate in the public sphere. Honneth and Young criticize in various ways the excluding effect of argumentation: are unargumentative speeches excluded from the public debate? I show how Habermas\u2019s model can provide some responses to these various objections by drawing inspiration from his treatment of the gap between religious and post-metaphysical world views.",

We study them to explore the relationship between Habermas\u2019s concepts of the lifeworld and political spheres, which analysts have critiqued as opaque. Drawing on Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action, we debate prevailing understandings of the implications of his work for deliberative democracy via an exploration of the films. By expanding the definition of the term \u2018motion\u2019 (otherwise known as \u2018draft resolution\u2019), we relate this concept to these Habermasian themes. Thus, this paper analyses feature film case studies as they incorporate motions into fictionalised accounts. We suggest that focusing on these movies\u2019 motions, embedded in unfolding narratives, can help reconceive Habermas\u2019s work to illustrate fluidity in how people and ideas may move between informal and more formal spheres. Ultimately, by showcasing the importance of motions in political participation, via these movies, we advance the idea that motions may be seen as part of a ladder of involvement, providing further opportunities for encouraging participation.",

In his writings, he focused primarily on legal philosophy from a positivist perspective. However, there are also significant overlaps with the field of political theory as Weinberger examined the conditions for the functioning of contemporary democracies. In this paper, some of the main features of his conception of the so-called \u201cstructured democracy\u201d are clarified. The conception opposed several other democratic theories, especially the elitist (Schumpeterian), the majoritarian, but also the discursive one, as represented by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, with whom Weinberger fundamentally disagreed. The paper focuses on several key elements of his theory, such as the leading ideas, the role of institutions, open society, and his critique of marketing methods in politics.",

      "abstract": "Miguel Vatter \u2019 s Divine Democracy: Political Theology after Carl Schmitt is an insightful and timely study of the theological dimensions of the political theory underlying modern liberal democracy. Vatter skillfully illuminates the distinctive discourse of political theology that emerged in the twentieth century as a response to the groundbreaking work of German legal theorist and political philosopher Carl Schmitt. Vatter argues per-suasively that we must reject the notion that the establishment of modern liberal democratic regimes in the modern period represents a de \ufb01 nite severance of political and theological concepts and symbols. For Vatter, what is at stake in this exploration of political theology is nothing less than resolving the legitimation crisis endemic in contemporary democratic states inasmuch as \u201c what makes it di \ufb03 cult for modern democracy to tell its own secular story is the problem of the legitimacy of power. \u201d 1 Carl Schmitt plays a key role in this process of democratic self-discovery not only as the originator of the modern usage of the concept of political theology, but more importantly as the chief exponent of the argument that the modern idea of legitimacy intertwines political rule and spiritual salvation in a broader framework resting on the premise that \u201c all signi \ufb01 cant concepts of the state are secularized theological concepts. \u201d 2 In concrete political and constitutional terms, Vatter illustrates that Schmitt \u2019 s aim with his use of the concept of political theology in the context of 1920s Weimar Germany was to reinstate the Hobbesian ideal of absolute sovereignty and maintain the monarchical principle in conditions of mass modern democracy (2). It is, thus, not surprising that in Vatter \u2019 s rendering political theology took a \u201c democratic turn \u201d years \u2019 s \ufb01 rst concept theology philosophically",

Further, he documents Habermas\u2019s trajectory from his early theoretical works through his linguistic turn to the present. The study demonstrates how Habermas\u2019s philosophical work from his early theory of the public sphere to his linguistic turn establishes Habermas\u2019s theme of communicative action as a major philosophical contribution which has relevance for the many theoretical and political texts Habermas has produced in his long, distinguished, and immensely productive career. Yet, in a concluding critical section, I argue that M\u00fcller-Doohm does not adequately engage with Habermas\u2019s theoretical conceptions, downplaying his philosophical achievements while failing to explore relevant theoretical literature and philosophical debates on Habermas that have accompanied his work for decades.",

The thought experiment is carried out using data from 30 semi-structured interviews with actors from the coffee industry. Supplementing the thought experiment with empirical insights allows for a deeper understanding of supply chain dynamics and how these are impacted by the application of the philosophical viewpoints.FindingsThe research stresses the importance of SCM scholars being aware of the underlying assumptions of their research, as these have a remarkable impact on theory building. A combination of empirical insights and philosophical understandings makes it possible to reflect on the underlying concepts of SCM, providing suggestions for reimagining SCM.Originality/valueThe contribution of the research is twofold. First, the paper presents an original view on SCM, as the thought experiment is introduced as an approach to better understand SCM concepts. By challenging the underlying assumptions with political philosophy, researchers will be better equipped to address grand challenges in the twenty-first century. Second, this is exemplified by the case study of the coffee supply chain, which provides the reader with insight into the dynamics of supply chains with prevalent power differences.",

The\u00a0article analyzes, on the one hand, the problems of gradual revision of the theory of medieval stasis in academic historiography, and on the other hand, the features of its positive idealization in\u00a0medievalism. It is shown that modern medievalism could not fully assimilate the concept of medieval stasis, integrating into intellectual discourse only those of its aspects that allow constructing the image of the Middle Ages as an exceptionally stable period, when social and political changes were not only impossible, but also were unnecessary. It is shown that 1) the concept of medieval stasis in modern historiography is gradually perceived as part of the intellectual history of the medieval studies, 2) medievalism perceives the stability of feudal structures as its positive characteristic, 3)\u00a0the\u00a0use of the concept of medieval stasis in modern medievalism allows to construct the preservation of chronologically prolonged images of Middle Ages, 4) within the framework of the idealization of the Middle Ages, modern medievalist discourse synthesizes the \u201creal\u201d and the \u201cmagical\u201d, which excludes the development of narrative structure and the transformation of social, economic and political relations and institutions, 5) the archaic vision of the Middle Ages through the prism of stasis confirms the limitations of the cognitive capabilities of medievalism.",

When he applies this communicative action perspective to culture and society, Habermas diagnoses the pathologies that occur when people coordinate their actions strategically through artificial systems rather than cooperatively through dialogue. When he applies it to ethical theory, he draws out the assumptions interlocutors must make when they argue\u2014they are obliged to attempt to justify claims so that they could be universally accepted by those involved in the discourse.\n In addition to theorizing communication, Habermas throughout his work analyzes the structures and systems that enable public communication in civil society. From this perspective, democratic society relies on spaces and institutions that allow for the public to debate matters of common concern, particularly when they involve the state. In his historical account, Habermas argues that the \u201cpublic sphere\u201d transformed during the Enlightenment to give communicative outlets to an emerging bourgeois class. From a legal and philosophical perspective, he outlines conditions for political and communicative agency in a modern constitutional state.\n Communication scholars have had a mixed reaction to Habermas. He offers a vision of critical theory that allows for practical reason, but some assert that his theories are too idealistic and counterfactual to apply to real-life discourse. However, other scholars have nuanced his theory by putting him in dialogue with the rhetorical tradition. Publics and counterpublics especially have become common parlance and have helped explain protest, advocacy, and the constitution of communities in democratic culture.",

      "abstract": "Undoubtedly, the contribution of public opinion and involvement is a critical aspect in shaping and influencing the political, social, and democratic courses within a nation. The concept of the public sphere acknowledges the presence and studies the initiation of integral discourses conducted by the public. Indeed, the German philosopher, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, instigated and established the understanding of such a concept. He critically highlights that the presence and participatory nature of the public sphere is crucial for a democracy. His theory, espoused in his 1985 Theory of Communicative Action, is predicated upon the principle that how we communicate, affects the content of that communication in the reasonable discourse of a mature democracy (Lock and Strong, 2010, p. 78). Nevertheless, it is evident that the development of technology and the internet has led to immense changes in the manner in which the public is able to become involved in such activities. Unquestionably, newspapers, writing letters, television and public meetings are no longer the only public sphere sources of the communication of information and the rise of social media and the virtual world provides many new sorts of opportunities for the exchange of views (Masip et al, 2019). J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 theory was established over a decade before the advent of social media, which raises critical questions as to the placement of the public sphere in the context of the realm of social media. The public sphere has been fundamentally developed by digital communication and the emergence of the immediacy of opinion making via social media platforms, introducing a less personally interactive but much broader participatory base, increasingly sophisticated and more contentious (Mahlouly, 2013). This paper will examine the nature of communication in the contemporary public sphere and verify whether the rise of social media and the virtual world extends the public sphere or diminishes the level of rational conversation through exploring the public sphere; and monitor his structure, function and places of work, according to Habermas\u2019 theoretical vision. Moreover, to explain its components in the political and social field in the lifeworld. Also, to what extent of the contemporary sphere's applicability to Habermas' communicative theory. While Habermas' vision of the public sphere and communication was emphasized, it has been argued the perspective of Hannah Arendt and her \u201cpublic realm\u201d. In addition, many contemporary thinkers, particularly Fraser, argued about the concept of the contemporary public sphere in the postmodern.",

For this reason, a definite regulatory structure (institutionalization) is needed to minimize and overcome various problems that arise. Al-Mawardi is one of the most interesting Islamic political thinkers to discuss. The basic concept of al-Mawardi's political thought is the origin of the social contract theory. Through qualitative research methods through literature studies, this article will discuss al-Mawardi's social contract theory based on his political thoughts. The discussion in this article starts from a discussion of al-Mawardi's biography, al-Mawardi's main thoughts regarding the state and leadership, as well as the relationship between the ruler and the people which later became the social contract theory.",

      "abstract": "The Traditional Humanist Paradigm perceives literature as an ahistorical and apolitical entity to be examined. The above premise is supported by Eliot\u2019s (1982) notion of depersonalisation, which states that the personal in any literary writing must be subjugated. The advancement of theory tries to analyse literature as discourse, which consists of numerous levels of reality that contribute to multidimensional truth perspectives. This poses a challenge for language as a way of constructing Reality, as all truths are simply partial representations. Postmodernism subverts the act of canonisation in literature, making personal writings such as autobiographies and memoirs a forum for discussion. Apart from that, it fundamentally challenges the concept of universality, viewing literature as a re-presentation of race, ethnicity, caste, class, gender, and the period in which it was produced. Among these re-presentations, autobiographical writing is gaining traction, indicating a transition from personal narrative to political and subsequently to politicise. As a relevant frame, this study will trace this transformation through Sudha Murthy\u2019s JRD\u2019s words inspired me in philanthropy and few other writings. The relevance of the personal-political link will be highlighted as a result.",

      "abstract": "racial justice. Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has released increasingly dire predictions of the future as climate change has moved from expectation to reality. For some, returning to Rawls may feel like a warm blanket in such circumstances. After all, a good blanket is valuable, even if one\u2019s identity isn\u2019t wrapped up in it, and affirming the importance of justice remains worthwhile. But Forrester suggests we can do more with egalitarian liberalism today. If we take seriously the enormity of contemporary injustice, achieving freedom and equality together will require not only tremendous ambition and radical imagination but also real humility to reckon with how pervasive injustice has so far shaped egalitarian liberalism itself. Demanding equality in a society pervasively structured by white supremacy means something different than simply asking whether resources should be redistributed from policing to other public services. Similarly, we can and should consider the fair distribution of costs of adapting to a changing climate, but we also urgently need to begin a fundamental transformation of the unsustainable basic structure of global society. And while egalitarian liberals in elite schools arguably benefited from the inequality of the 1970s and 80s, the neoliberal hollowing out of universities may have reached the point that the continued viability of reading, writing, and teaching political theory and philosophy as a profession depends on making higher education genuinely available and accessible to all. Such work can certainly be done in the spirit of Rawls, but it will require conceptual tools that go beyond his, and it will require political allies who are not themselves egalitarian liberals. Accordingly, against increasingly open defense of inequality and authoritarianism, we need new shared imaginaries that can help believers in human freedom and equality identify not with any one master thinker but with a broader coalition of those committed to justice for all.",

      "abstract": "Background:\u00a0In higher education (HE), female academics frequently experience self-doubt, imposter syndrome and marginalisation, which can negatively impact their self-confidence. These challenges are intensified by systemic gender biases and exclusionary institutional cultures.\nObjectives:\u00a0This study explores how two female academics situated within the South African HE context reclaimed their self-confidence through participation in an informal community of practice (CoP). It examines how relational and reflective support can contribute to academic identity formation and professional growth.\nMethods:\u00a0Using collaborative autoethnography (CAE), the authors reflected on their lived experiences of navigating academic spaces. As both participants and co-researchers, they drew on personal narratives to explore the intersections of career confidence, institutional culture and gendered experiences. Framed by Moon\u2019s Theory of Academic Assertiveness, Feminist Voice Theory and Feminist Praxis, the authors employed thematic analysis to identify and interpret key patterns within their reflections.\nResults:\u00a0The study revealed five interrelated themes: (1) gendered barriers and structural inequity, (2) emotional toll and loss of confidence, (3) disrupted career trajectories, (4) the transformative potential of shared vulnerability and (5) the empowering role of a CoP. Informal peer support was found to be a powerful mechanism for enhancing confidence and fostering resilience.\nConclusion:\u00a0Self-confidence in academia is not a given but is shaped by institutional contexts and interpersonal support. While structural reforms are essential, grassroot communities of practice offer meaningful, affirming spaces for career development and self-empowerment.\nContribution:\u00a0This study highlights how informal, reflective partnerships can serve as tools for building self-confidence among female academics, offering valuable insights for career development, mentorship and institutional transformation.",

      "abstract": "Across the globe the prevalence of men who work in the early education and care field\u00a0is scant. This phenomenon is evidenced in the Canadian childcare milieu where male early childhood professionals constitute a modest fraction of the sector. At the nucleus of this are gender-situated scrutinization, role model binaries, and adverse occupational outcomes. Subsequently a Qualitative Intrinsic Case Study, rooted in a Social Constructivist Philosophical Paradigm, was applied to secure the voices of men who work in Ontario, Canada. Novel to findings of this study are the heterogenous reactions of family and friends, male role model disharmony, strategies adopted by participants to self-protect and avoid speculation, forgotten child voices, and nuances affiliated with working in a care profession. Participants of this study urge other male early years professionals and communities to intentionally probe this domain of study, with the aim to bolster male participation in the sector.",

The analyses employ labeling theory as a theoretical lens and it is situated in the field of\n language policy and planning (LPP). The participants depict a stepwise process: (1)\n enquiries and preparations\n ,\n (2)\n a period of turmoil\n with the allocation of power to different actors and (3)\n publication, reception\n and acceptance\n . Beyond this process, a\n historical shift\n is described in the power relation in LPP\n between majority and minority in the language community, which includes an increased respect for a minority\u2019s right to\n self-labeling, and perhaps also increased attention paid to avoiding linguistic wounding.\n",

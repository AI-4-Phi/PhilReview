        "Indeed, the statement, \u201cThe country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future,\u201d by Marx has been used in sociological literature as a fundamental assumption during the construction of a modernization project. Thus, a Euro-centralist social sciences understanding with claims of universality has been developed that positions itself in the center and that others those not belonging to itself. Even though the effects and dimensions of Euro-centralist practices are presented differently by the researchers in the field, we are of the opinion that Arif Dirlik has put forth the most comprehensive judgment by stating that \u201cEurocentrism is the product of an unusual desire and effort put forth for organizing knowledge about the world in a systematic whole.",
        "And of course, factors such as colonization and slave trade have always been ignored in \u201chistory.\u201d The approach of the West that places itself in the center has resulted in reactions from the \u201cperiphery.\u201d In this regard, cultural diversity was tried to be emphasized through the idea of multiple modernities; however, evaluation of the generated alternative modernities in comparison with Western modernity has strengthened the current understanding. A similar danger is present in the practices of culturality that is another alternative. The culturalist paradigm that considers the universality claim of the Western-centered mental structure as unnecessary generates new others by means of the belief in the superiority of its own culture. It tries to object to the Eurocentrism with a reductionist, reactionary and hegemonic structure by loading all areas of social experience to culture."

        "This paper attempts to develop a phenomenological account of community which would not be pervaded by Eurocentric assumptions. Such Eurocentrism is what Husserl\u2019s phenomenological framework has been accused of. I first reconstruct Husserl\u2019s phenomenology of community in his late transcendental phenomenology by examining the Vienna Lecture.",
        "I show that Husserl\u2019s Eurocentrism is encapsulated in his account of corporeity, which simultaneously recognizes the importance of corporeity and its necessary overcoming in theoria, which originates in the European philosopher. I then argue that Merleau-Ponty, through his rigorously embodied phenomenology, can offer a non-Eurocentric phenomenology of community.",

This article mobilizes a communicative conception of democracy. While it is generally accepted that communication is important for democracy, there are directions in democracy theory that understand communication as not merely instrumental but as central to what democracy is and should be. Inspired by Dewey, Habermas, and Young, this paper articulates a conception of democracy as communication. It is then argued that this \u201cdeep-communicative\u201d ideal of democracy, together with the usual ethical and epistemic norms of communication as sketched by O\u2019Neill, offer a tentative normative framework for evaluating digital technologies in relation to democracy.",

As a student of John Dewey at Columbia University, young Ambedkar was heavily influenced by the pragmatist ideas of democracy and reconstruction. Throughout his life he would continue to evoke Dewey\u2019s words and ideas in his fight against caste injustice in India. This article explores the possibility that Ambedkar could have been influenced by Dewey\u2019s work, \u201cCreative Democracy\u2014The Task Before Us.\u201d In exploring the intriguing evidence that points toward such an influence, Ambedkar\u2019s The Buddha and His Dhamma emerges as a site of pragmatist reconstruction of Buddhism and as a personal democratic guide to action.",

After recalling Habermas\u2019s views on the public sphere, I present and discuss various objections raised by other critical theorists: Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nancy Fraser, Axel Honneth and Iris Marion Young. These criticisms insist on the paradoxically excluding effects of a conception of democracy that promotes civic participation in the public debate. Negt, Kluge and Fraser develop a Marxist line of analysis that question who can participate in the public sphere. Honneth and Young criticize in various ways the excluding effect of argumentation: are unargumentative speeches excluded from the public debate? I show how Habermas\u2019s model can provide some responses to these various objections by drawing inspiration from his treatment of the gap between religious and post-metaphysical world views.",

      "abstract": "Recently, stroke is a new trend among the young age group in the range of 15-45 years. One of the main complications of this disease is s physical disability, but it also causes communication disorders, emotional disturbances, pain, sleep disturbances, depression, and dysphagia. All of these signs have a major impact on the productivity of the young age group. This article aims to review literatures related to the factors that influence the incidence of stroke at a young age. This study uses a literature study design from 6 databases, namely: Science Direct, ProQuest, Wiley, Sage Pub and Pubmed research. The search used various keyword combinations with the help of Boolean operators, including: Young Stroke; Young Adults; Risk Factor; Factor, combined as MESH terms and keywords, and assessment of article quality using the JBI Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Cohort studies and Case-Control Studies. There were 19 selected articles were analyzed by adjusting the inclusion criteria, namely articles published in the last year, full text accessible, young stroke patient respondents, and discuss the factors that influence the incidence of stroke at a young age. Based on the results of the review, there are several factors that influence the occurance of stroke at a young age including physical factors with a percentage of 85%, lifestyle factors with a percentage of 55%, psychological factors with a percentage of 15%, sex factors with a percentage of 10% and age factors. as much as 5%. Implications in clinical practice include providing psychoeducation as a preventive measure to reduce the incidence of stroke at a young age.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the relevance of Critical Theory for education in the contributions of Habermas and Young. It connects their respective proposals of deliberative democracy and communicative democracy by applying a conceptual methodology. Habermas\u2019 criticism of the insufficiencies of the liberal and republican models as well as his alternative based on the deliberative model is developed as a third way. Deliberation, as such, is then structured on two requirements: the legal institutionalization of the rules of participation in the public sphere and the democratic formation of individuals. Young considers that Habermas\u2019 proposal has made progress. However, it is still flawed, as it does not include the plurality of expressions of the subjects and incurs exclusions from historically marginalized social groups such as Blacks, women, and low-income groups. Young\u2019s alternative is a model of communicative democracy that contemplates pluralisms, dissent, and multiple forms of communication and narratives. It shows emotional, affective, biographical, bodily, and existential components obliterated by Habermas\u2019 proposal. To conclude, it advances the hypothesis that Habermas and Young, despite their differences, offer indispensable elements to rethink broad educational processes in which citizenship and the preparation for inclusive participation in society are prominent in the face of technical and individualistic restrictions.",

      "abstract": "To what extent should the child\u2019s point of view be included when a political community endeavors to make just decisions, and why? Democrats are committed to a principle of political inclusion grounded in equal respect for persons. Yet we regularly deny children the right to vote and we often just assume that the citizens doing the hard work of democratic deliberation are adults. As I will show, electoral conceptions of democracy can plausibly reconcile this tension in a way that requires no serious adjustment to the principle of inclusion. However, I also argue that a similar reconciliation seems unavailable to deliberative conceptions of democracy, and this fact has implications for how deliberative democrats should understand political inclusion and its relationship to the aims of schooling. I do this by providing a broad overview of deliberative conceptions of democracy, with a focus on some fundamental epistemic features of these conceptions, to explain why deliberative democrats must take a different approach. I then look at different arguments for children\u2019s deliberative inclusion and propose an account of my own. Finally, I use this account in order to offer a different perspective on the aims of schooling under deliberative conceptions of democracy.

However, the literature on voting rights has surfaced a 1 For ease of writing I will use the terms child and children. But I have in mind here any minor, such as adolescents. Very young children are physically incapable or have not acquired even basic understandings. The child I therefore have in view is someone who can speak and act but is nonetheless denied rights of participation.

In brief, any argument for why children and adolescents should be excluded from voting also justifies the exclusion of adults on relevantly similar grounds. For example, if it is justifiable to exclude children because they lack",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mainstream Indian films ignore the experiences of marginalized communities, blaming the poor for their situation and supporting neoliberal ideas (Roy, A. 2010. Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development. London: Routledge; Wacquant, L. 2020. Punishing the Poor: The Neoliberal Government of Social Insecurity. Durham, NC: Duke University Press). This study examines Madras (2014) and Vada Chennai (2018, transl. North Chennai) as critiques of neoliberal visuals, using vernacular forms to reclaim marginalised spaces and frame poverty as structural violence through subaltern resistance. This study employs qualitative textual analysis within a postcolonial framework (Bhabha, H. K. 1994. The Location of Culture. London: Routledge; Spivak, G. C. 1988. \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d In Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture, edited by C. Nelson and L. Grossberg, 271\u2013313). Urbana: University of Illinois Press) to show how Tamil films challenge neoliberal poverty ideals, reclaim oppressed spaces as resistance (Sassen, S. 2014. Expulsions: Brutality and Complexity in the Global Economy. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), and expose intersectional caste-class violence (Crenshaw, K. W. 2013. \u201cMargins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color.\u201d In The Public Nature of Private Violence, 93\u2013118. London: Routledge), advancing decolonial narratives centred on vulnerable subalterns in the Global South.",

      "abstract": "In her essay \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d \u2013 originally published in Cary Nelson and Lawrence Grossberg\u2019s Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture (1988), Gayatri Spivak puts the colonial logic in words through the formulation \u201cWhite men are saving brown women from brown men\u201d. She claims further that nowadays it is not only men who are engaged in this business. In this article I read the reception and paratexts of African literature in Swedish translation, more specifically: how are female African authors and their works discussed in a Swedish context, and how do colonial patterns (such as the one Spivak has formulated) structure the discourses about these literatures? And how can one understand these discourses from an intersectional perspective, with sexuality and whiteness as the main intersections?",

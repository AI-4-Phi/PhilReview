      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In Beyond Empathy and Inclusion: The Challenge of Listening in Deliberative Democracy, Mary F. Scudder defends a listening-based approach to deliberative democracy. On this account, democratic legitimacy requires that citizens listen to each other\u2019s deliberative contributions to give them fair consideration. She opposes this listening-based approach to a recent \u201cempathic turn\u201d in deliberative democratic theory, which emphasizes the importance of imaginative perspective-taking in democratic deliberation. Scudder develops an incisive critique of relying on empathy in democratic deliberation. According to her argument, our capacity to empathize is severely limited, and empathy cannot replace, but only distort listening. This argument suggests that we should listen rather than empathize in democratic deliberation. In this paper, we challenge the implicit assumption that empathy and listening must be regarded as mutually exclusive alternatives. We argue that empathy still has an important place within a listening-centric approach to democracy because empathy can improve listening broadly understood, according to its own inherent aim of ensuring fair consideration. Specifically, we identify three constructive roles that empathy can play in facilitating democratic listening: it can help us to understand what someone has said, see where someone is coming from, and promote mutual understanding. We argue that recognizing these constructive roles for empathy in democratic deliberation is compatible with acknowledging empathy\u2019s limits and accepting that we should sometimes prefer listening without empathy. Ceasing to conceive of empathy and listening as mutually exclusive options opens up new questions and we close by discussing some potential directions of future study.",

Adopting such an approach constitutes a challenge, however, due to the opacity of AI and strong knowledge boundaries between experts and citizens. This undermines trust in AI and undercuts key conditions for deliberation. We approach this challenge as a problem of situating the knowledge of actors from the AI industry within a deliberative system. We develop a new framework of responsibilities for AI innovation as well as a deliberative governance approach for enacting these responsibilities. In elucidating this approach, we show how actors from the AI industry can most effectively engage with experts and nonexperts in different social venues to facilitate well-informed judgments on opaque AI systems and thus effectuate their democratic governance.",

Having outlined theories of deliberative democracy\u2014focussing on Habermas\u2019s discourse model\u2014and pragma-dialectic methods for analysing argumentative exchanges in the real world, we then relate them. From this we identify the potential for using the enhanced detail of pragma-dialectic analysis to constructively understand dynamics of inclusion in the political decision processes of central concern to deliberative democratic theories. In the remainder of the article we illustrate this potential with our own pragma-dialectic analysis of an instance of real-world argumentation in a political policymaking process\u2014a deliberative forum in the contentious field of mental health. The detail afforded by the pragma-dialectic method allows us to more clearly identify the complex layers and dynamics of argument involved in these policy deliberations, allowing insights into mechanisms for inclusion in deliberations, relative to the parties to such deliberations, their roles and competing interests and perspectives. By relating the two fields of deliberative democratic theory and pragma-dialectics this article aims to develop their complementary potential\u2014in particular by suggesting, and briefly illustrating\u2014how pragma-dialectic methods might enhance analysis of the dynamics of argumentation in political policymaking processes, in particular as an aid to constructive reflection on those processes by theorists and participants together.",

      "abstract": "In the discussions that dominated the initial debates, deliberative democracy first and foremost concerned the how question of democracy: how do the people rule themselves in a democratic manner? While there are certainly many different answers to this question, two have been particularly salient: the aggregative conception of democracy, which relies on electoral representation in legislation; and the deliberative conception that includes any one of a family of views, according to which the public deliberation of free and equal citizens is the core of legitimate political decision-making and self-rule. Beyond this fundamental agreement, however, each of the terms of this definition is hotly debated among deliberative democrats. Various institutional and non-institutional locations for deliberation have been proposed and debated, as have various attempts to determine their feasibility. At the core of deliberative democracy, in any of its forms, is the idea that deliberation essentially involves publicly giving reasons to justify decisions, policies or laws, all of which are the means by which citizens constitute and regulate their common life together. However, even as the debates stressed a sharp contrast between deliberation and aggregation, few deliberative democrats were willing to replace voting with deliberation, but rather sought to interpret it as a phase of deliberation and the important exercise of the decisional status of citizens. This solution points to a pattern for many of the future debates, in which this overly sharp contrast becomes mitigated by the fact that any theory must include both decision mecha",

We review three developments that have recently occurred in deliberative democracy theory within political science and philosophy: 1) the conceptualization of deliberative systems (macro level), 2) the considerations of mini-publics (micro level), and 3) the role of online deliberation. We discuss the challenges and prospects that incorporating these three developments into future CSR-related research creates. We thereby also introduce the articles in this special issue and show how they connect to each of the three developments. On the basis of this discussion, we outline the contours for a more general program of distributed deliberative CSR that enables CSR scholars to incorporate an updated understanding of deliberative democracy theory into their future work.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between narrative inclusion and the notion of equality from the perspective of the theory of deliberative democracy. It is based on the assumption that taking into account the diversity of discursive competences influences the constructed justifications constituting the source of legitimacy of political decisions. Moving beyond a purely argumentative discourse towards emphasising pluralism provides a significant enough modification of the theory to claim that it constitutes a separate model of deliberation. At the starting point, the role and purpose of narrative is presented, as well as the conditions under which it can be incorporated into deliberative processes. Then, consideration is given to the transformation of the category of equality that is brought about by introducing narrative to the framework of subject inclusion. The shift in meaning from unconditional equality to equalisation of opportunities is also addressed, in both procedural and substantive terms. Finally, the paper outlines the possible practical problems and risks that the inclusion of narrative in deliberation may raise.",

      "abstract": "In this article I examine the structure of four deliberative models: epistemic democracy, epistocracy, dystopic algocracy, and utopian algocracy. Epistocracy and algocracy (which in its two versions is an extremization of epistocracy) represent a challenge to the alleged epistemic superiority of democracy: epistocracy for its emphasis on the role of experts; algocracy for its emphasis on technique as a cognitively and ethically superior tool. In the concluding remarks I will advance the thesis that these challenges can only be answered by emphasizing the value of citizens\u2019 political participation, which can also represent both an increase in their cognitive abilities and a value for public ethics.",

This overload has been accompanied by marked decline in civility and argumentative complexity. Uncivil behavior by elites and pathological mass communication reinforce each other. How do we break this vicious cycle? Asking elites to behave better is futile so long as there is a public ripe to be polarized and exploited by demagogues and media manipulators. Thus, any response has to involve ordinary citizens; but are they up to the task? Social science on \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d offers reasons for optimism about citizens' capacity to avoid polarization and manipulation and to make sound decisions. The real world of democratic politics is currently far from the deliberative ideal, but empirical evidence shows that the gap can be closed.",

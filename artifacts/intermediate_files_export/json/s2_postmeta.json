Instead, once his fideism is overcome, Habermas\u2019 postmetaphysical discourse theory provides valuable resources for contemporary Catholic theology. This article thus offers both a theological assessment of Habermas\u2019 view of religious belief and an argument for a Catholic appropriation of Habermas\u2019 postmetaphysical thinking.",

Despite repeated anti-modernist ideological attacks, the idea of legal modernity works rather well, and today it is undoubtedly the necessary counter-horizon to contemporary legal perception. Far from offering any \u201cremnants\u201d of the past (as postmodernists claim), the promise of legal modernity \u2013 still incomplete, as Habermas assures us \u2013 constitutes an essential incentive to enable us to understand the challenges of our commitment to the law and to take a stand in this regard. To this end, we analyze the concept of legal modernity according to J\u00fcrgen Habermas, as it centers on the promise of democratic self-regulation (). It is here to examine Habermas' formula according to which we should understand legal modernity according to the model of subjects of law who can mutually recognize us as authors and recipients of law, legal norms and institutions, but also and especially to clarify the meaning of this formula by enacting a fully democratic conception of law that seeks to create the necessary distancing from ideas Rationality and ethics for today's legal philosophers. Before we can clarify Habermas's concept of legal modernity, it is first appropriate to look at the philosophical constitution of legal modernity and self-legislation as linked to what is called \"normative interaction.\" We will then consider how the Habermasian concept of legal modernity finds its resonance in the democratic view of legal issues.",

Among the aspects of his work addressed are his conception of communicative rationality as a countervailing force to the colonization of the lifeworld by capitalism and his understanding of philosophy after Hegel as postmetaphysical thinking, for which he has recently provided a comprehensive historical grounding. The scope and relevance of his ideas can be seen from his reflections on current issues, ranging from the prospects of translational democracy at a time of resurgent nationalism and populism, to political developments in Germany since reunification, to the role of religion in the public sphere and the impact of the new social media on democratic discourse.",

Although he does not have a specific work on this subject, just as his theory of religion, a Philosophy of Technology in Habermas\u2019 thought is spread out in the architectonic of his intellectual trajectory. In this sense, the objective of this article is to offer elements that can be articulated in order to build a theoretical-conceptual and referential framework based on the main events and constructions in Habermas\u2019 thinking that are related with the technical/technological phenomenon. How does the latter relate to the master coordinates of Habermas\u2019 thinking, viz. Modernity, rationality, and society? How does it appear and what is its impact on the concepts of life-world and system? Based on these questions, we intend to offer elements for the construction of a cartography of Habermas thinking about technique.

His two-volume Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie is the culmination of this project. Spurred by the attacks of 9/11 and the growing conflict between religion and the forces of secularization, I argue that this philosophy of history is the centerpiece of an important turning point in Habermas\u2019s intellectual development. Instead of interpreting religion merely as part of the history of postmetaphysical thinking, Habermas now sees it as a crucial normative resource for both philosophy and social cohesion in the future aswell. Despite its backward-looking approach,my basic thesis is that this book is best understood as a forward-looking appeal for a tolerant, self-reflective democratic politics that brings religious and secular citizens together dialogically through the cooperative use of their rational freedom.",

My argument is that the concept of \"postsecular\" introduces significant normative tensions for the formal and pragmatic view of reason defended by Habermas in previous work. In particular, the turn to a \"post-secular society\" threatens the evolutionary narrative that Habermas (following Weber) espoused in The Theory of Communicative Action (1981, 1987), The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity (1990) or Postmetaphysical Thinking (1992), according to which modern \"communicative\" reason dialecticlly supersedes religion. If this narrative is undermined, I argue, the claim to universality of \"communicative\" reason is also undermined. Thus, the benefits Habermas seeks to obtain from translation of religion are offset by a destabilization of tenets central to a \"postmetaphysical\" view of modernity.",

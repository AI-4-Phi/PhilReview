      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this roundtable discussion, Amy Allen, Lois McNay, Sarah Bufkin, and Emily Dyson debate the limitations of contemporary Frankfurt School theorizing when it comes to diagnosing social suffering and gesturing towards emancipatory practices that might shift the relations of force in today\u2019s social formations. In particular, they consider what has been lost in the turn to questions of metanormative foundations in place of a concrete, sociologically grounded analysis of power and oppression. In this wide-ranging conversation, Allen, McNay, Bufkin, and Dyson also engage with a range of questions confronting Critical Theorists today, including the marginalization of gender hierarchies and patriarchal domination as problems, the positionality of the theorist with respect to existing struggles, the Marxist legacy of the Frankfurt School, the problems of Eurocentrism and racism within Critical Theory, and the role of the aesthetic in social critique.",

      "abstract": "This review of Amy Allen\u2019s book, The End of Progress (2016), first addresses the structure of the book and focuses on specific points made in individual chapters, including the affinity between postcolonial theory and the approaches of Adorno and Foucault in subjecting the notion of historical progress to \u201cwithering critique,\u201d and Allen\u2019s alternative approach to decolonization; Habermas\u2019 aim to put critical theory on a secure normative footing; Honneth\u2019s stance that the history of an ethical sphere is an unplanned learning process kept in motion by a struggle for recognition; Forst\u2019s attempt to reconstruct Critical Theory\u2019s normative account through a return to Kant rather than Hegel; and Allen\u2019s claim that her approach is fully in the spirit of Critical Theory and could be seen as continuation of Critical Theory\u2019s first generation, as in Adorno, and how it is a \u201cgenealogical\u201d approach that draws on Adorno\u2019s negative dialectics and critique of identity thinking, as well as on Nietzsche\u2019s conception of genealogy, as developed by Foucault. The second part of my response raises three issues: (1) Allen\u2019s partial compromise with the idea of progress; (2) whether critical theory would profit from engagement with other critical theories and theories of ethics, beyond postcolonial theory; and (3) nonwestern theories shed a different light on the question of Allen\u2019s critique, a theme that also draws attention to the gesture of decolonizing, the distinctions between colonialism and empire, and the sociology of knowledge production.",

      "abstract": "Beginning with the influential discussion of the dialectic of progress found in Amy Allen\u2019s The End of Progress, this paper outlines some difficulties encountered by critical theories of normative justification drawing on the early Frankfurt School. Characterizing Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s critical social theory as a dialectical reflection eschewing questions of normative foundations, I relate their well-known treatment of the dialectic of enlightenment reason and myth to their critique of capitalist society as a negative totality. By exploring the concepts of historical development used by Adorno and Horkheimer to describe both the progressive domination of capitalism, and the formation and cultivation of reflective consciousness, I trace the importance of progression and its inseparable relationship to regression in these early versions of critical theory. The dialectical social theory found here recognizes the persistence of social contradictions on both a methodological level and on the level of theory\u2019s development and expression, a connection potentially obscured by a division of historical progress according to its temporal orientation. Particularly in Adorno\u2019s later work, an opposition to the negative social totality requires notions of cultivation and learning which work against the prevailing forms of conceptual thinking, including the concern for the stability of rational foundations.",

      "abstract": "This chapter rethinks the future of critical theory by engaging Amy Allen\u2019s recent work. Allen does the Frankfurt School a great service by drawing a sharp-edged picture of some significant problems. I aim to think along with her in a spirit of shared sympathies that follow sometimes divergent paths. I agree with Allen\u2019s critique of Frankfurt tendencies toward Eurocentrism, progress thinking, and historical teleology. However, I also argue that critical theory must be more thoroughly reconfigured to adequately address the struggles and wishes of our age. Specifically, recent work of the Frankfurt School displaces critique in two important ways. The first is a tendency to work at a paradigmatic, meta-level of analysis rather than focusing on concrete problems. The second is a tendency to rely on democratic procedure for normativity without taking account of the tensions and contradictions in actual political cultures. In place of these uncritical tendencies, we need more interpretive and freely experimental critical strategies. One example is an interpretive approach that problematizes political cultures, revealing the tensions ignored by proceduralism. Another example lies in the rich archives of postcolonial thought that have had such a large impact on contemporary political and social life. Postcolonial critique is a non-dogmatic and flexible form of interpretation that has great potential to address problems of racism, international inequality, and the false universalism of many of our ideals.",

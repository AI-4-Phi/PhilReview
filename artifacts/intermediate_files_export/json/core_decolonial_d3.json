      "abstract": "After 9/11, more than ever in the history of the United States of America, security and domesticity have become paradoxical antonyms in racially and ethnically mixed areas, like that of the US-Mexican border. The borderland\u2018s history is further complicated by the issue of illegal immigration and its corollaries, such as strict border control and mass deportations of \u2015aliens,\u2016 as well as the rising crime rate. Even though it is protected by a fence and monitored by heavily armed border patrols, the area\u2018s notoriety for narcosmuggling, human trafficking and femicide keeps growing. Paradoxically, the more drastic the security measures used, the more dangerous the borderland becomes. In her 2007 novel The Guardians, Ana Castillo suggests that tighter control itself is responsible for criminalizing the border. Focusing on a Mexican American woman\u2018s search for her brother lost during an illegal crossing, the novel presents a complex dynamic between security and domesticity. The following article attempts to trace this dynamic through the epistemic lens of decolonial methodology.Despu\u00e9s del 11-S, m\u00e1s que nunca antes en la historia de los Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica, la seguridad y la domesticidad se han convertido en ant\u00f3nimos parad\u00f3jicos en zonas de abundante mezcla racial y \u00e9tnica como la frontera entre M\u00e9xico y EE. UU. La historia de la zona fronteriza se ve complicada, adem\u00e1s, por la cuesti\u00f3n de la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal y sus distintos corolarios, como por ejemplo el estricto control aduanero existente, las deportaciones en masa de \u2015extranjeros\u2016 o el aumento de los \u00edndices de criminalidad. Incluso aunque se halle protegida por una valla y aunque est\u00e9 monitorizada por patrullas fronterizas fuertemente armadas, la ya notoria reputaci\u00f3n del \u00e1rea por el contrabando de drogas y personas, as\u00ed como por el feminicidio, sigue empeorando. Parad\u00f3jicamente, cuanto m\u00e1s dr\u00e1sticas son las medidas de seguridad empleadas, m\u00e1s peligrosa se vuelve la frontera. En su novela de 2007, Guardianes de la frontera, Ana Castillo sugiere que el recrudecimiento del control fronterizo es en s\u00ed responsable de la criminalizaci\u00f3n de la zona fronteriza. Centr\u00e1ndose en la historia de una mujer mexicano-estadounidense que busca a su hermano perdido durante un cruce ilegal de la frontera, la novela presenta una compleja din\u00e1mica entre seguridad y domesticidad. El presente art\u00edculo tiene como objeto explorar esta din\u00e1mica a trav\u00e9s de la lente epist\u00e9mica que ofrece la aplicaci\u00f3n de una metodolog\u00eda decolonial",

      "title": "\"The return of the excluded\" feminist and postcolonial perspectives on western modernity",
      "authors": [

      "year": 2016,
      "abstract": "In political, scholarly and cultural discussions in the \u2018Global North\u2019, ideas of freedom, democracy and human rights were considered universal and legitimated for political and military interventions mostly in non-Western countries. Debates about the universality of the right to intervene are discussed in the frame of universality versus particularity. Whereas universalists defend their arguments in the name of modernity, their challengers opposed to these kinds of universal assumptions refer to the importance of particularism\r\nand relativism; yet, both groups consider modernity as their main point of reference. To overcome this stalled discussion, I look at modernity through the deconstruction of epistemic dichotomies and hierarchies in order to open up a space for critical reflection on the concept itself. Contextualizing my reflections on modernity in the rich literature by scholars who challenge the dominant Western concept of modernity, I demonstrate that Western knowledge is not universal in an epistemic sense. Rather, it can be considered as a contentious concept with problematic assumptions about an epistemically\r\nneutral subject, adopting a universalistic perspective while erasing the meaning of geopolitical location (Grosfoguel 2011). Arguing against this idea of an \u2018assertive universality\u2019, the metaphor of \u2019travelling theories,\u2019 as proposed by Edward Said\r\nand Clifford Geertz, helps to reflect upon the local, social and individual positioning of knowledge. The focus of this contribution is the utilisation of feminist and postcolonial perspectives to contribute to the deconstruction of modernity as a homogenous monolithic bloc. Considering the frame itself, I question the hidden, not explicated assumptions in the production of Western knowledge. Arguing that knowledge\r\nproduction is not a question of geography but of epistemology, I deconstruct the modern project from the inside in order to overcome the epistemic dichotomy of modernity itself. The implications of this analysis for us as social scientists and researchers will be discussed at the end of the paper.peer-reviewe",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the notion of death as a philosophical and counter-hegemonic subject \u2018erased\u2019 from the imperialist cartography of knowledge. It revolves around three main points: the \u2018loss\u2019 of death from the imperialist epistemology of the global North, its subservient position towards the dominance of life in biopolitical discourses, and the instrumentality of death under the ongoing matrix of colonial/capitalist power. The paper challenges the hegemonic rationality of biopolitical discourses while proposing counter-hegemonic alternatives: they are hereby mainly situated in the critique of sovereignty exemplified by Achille Mbembe\u2019s groundbreaking work on the politics of death. In what serves as an attempt to avert our gaze from the dominant viewpoint of epistemic imperialism, the paper invites us to \u2018unlearn\u2019 what we are supposed to be proud of. As a way to engage in the decolonizing processes, it pleads for self-liberation from the forms of knowledge that, in their claim to be \u2018universal\u2019, continue to pertain to the imperialist reason and its hegemonic matrix of power",

      "abstract": "Recent studies on socio-spatial polarization and post-socialist spaces increasingly propose the use of postcolonial theory. Following this proposal, the paper attempts to make the decolonial approach fruitful for studying the crucial role that discourses play for rural peripheralisation processes in post-socialist Estonia. It shows that the Estonian discourses on peripheries manifest in a struggle between neoliberalism and interventionism as two competing regional development models that promote either self- or state responsibility for dealing with peripheralisation. Despite their differences, both models build on the same notion of modernity, as the colonial history associated with socialist modernity renders alternative models obsolete",

      "abstract": "This paper offers an interpretation of R\u016bdolfs Blaumanis\u2019 novella Andriksons (1898) that is based on three intellectual positions. (1) The insight gained by postcolonial criticism that the political and economic division of the world as created by colonial relationships and secured by a consciously shaped system of ideological models has left a lasting impression on the psychology of both the representatives of the superpowers and the local inhabitants of the colonized territories. The main thread of analysis is to research how the opinions of two characters and the differences in their worldviews meet in Blaumanis\u2019 text, and to reveal how the colonial and anti-colonial viewpoints are expressed in such confrontations. (2) Since Blaumanis\u2019 novella was written at the end of the 19th century, which was one of the most intensive periods of Latvian nation-building, the anti-colonial discourse is closely related to the manifestation of nationalism in art. Nationalism, or any ideology, is most powerful in a work of art when it is outwardly unnoticeable, but inwardly capacious and expressed as a potentiality; therefore, the poetics of the text are important in this paper. (3) The framework of my argument is provided by current debates on the so-called \u201cdecolonial turn\u201d which also involves concepts of modernity, coloniality and decoloniality. Therefore, the strategic aim of this research can be described as an effort to trace colonial contexts and decolonial options of modern Baltic cultures in global perspective",

      "abstract": "One of the distinctive features of environmental justice theory in Latin America is its influence by decolonial thought, which explains social and environmental injustices as arising from the project of modernity and the ongoing expansion of a European cultural imaginary. The decolonization of knowledge and social relations is highlighted as one of the key challenges for overcoming the history of violent oppression and marginalization in development and conservation practice in the region. In this paper we discuss how conflict transformation theory and practice has a role to play in this process. In doing so, we draw on the Socio-environmental Conflict Transformation (SCT) framework elaborated by Grupo Confluencias, which puts a focus on building community capacity to impact different spheres of power: people and networks, structures and cultural power. We discuss this framework and its practical use in the light of ongoing experiences with indigenous peoples in Latin America. We propose that by strengthening the power of agency of indigenous peoples to impact each of these spheres it is possible to build constructive intra and intercultural relations that can help increase social and environmental justice in their territories and thus contribute to decolonizing structures, relations and ways of being",

      "abstract": "En las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas las ciencias sociales se han visto deconstruidas por diferentes corrientes de pensamiento cr\u00edtico que buscan analizar el sistema mundo actual, la pol\u00edtica global y las relaciones sociales desde paradigmas y epistemolog\u00edas otras que sirvan para interpretar las diferentes temporalidades y localidades del poder y del conocimiento. Una de las corrientes m\u00e1s novedosas es el llamado pensamiento decolonial. Esta propuesta surge dentro del debate cr\u00edtico en las ciencias sociales, originalmente en las \u00e1reas de Sociolog\u00eda, Historia y Econom\u00eda Pol\u00edtica, y m\u00e1s recientemente en la disciplina de las Relaciones Internacionales. El pensamiento decolonial se plantea como cr\u00edtico de las ya establecidas teor\u00edas poscoloniales. Es impulsado desde Am\u00e9rica Latina por el proyecto conocido como modernidad/colonialidad/decolonialidad, que nos invita a cuestionar la modernidad europea desde la reflexi\u00f3n de su ant\u00edtesis, la colonialidad en Am\u00e9rica, y los efectos que la colonialidad del poder, del saber, y del ser, han tenido sobre el sujeto colonial global. En este art\u00edculo proponemos evaluar los aportes que el pensamiento decolonial puede hacer a la teor\u00eda de las Relaciones Internacionales y c\u00f3mo, junto con otras conceptualizaciones hechas desde la teor\u00eda cr\u00edtica, se podr\u00eda contribuir al di\u00e1logo pluriversal que sus autores proponen.In recent decades the social sciences have been deconstructed by different strands of critical thought that strive to analyze the contemporary world system, global politics and social relations from alternative paradigms and epistemologies allowing us to understand the different temporalities and locations of power and knowledge. One of the most recent movements is what has been called Decolonial thinking. This proposal originates within critical debate in the social sciences, originally in Sociology, History and Political Economy and more recently in International Relations. Decolonial thinking takes a critical approach to established postcolonial studies. Driven by Latin American scholars forming part of the modernity/coloniality/decoloniality project, Decolonial thinking invites us to question European modernity considering its antithesis, colonialism in America, and the effects of Coloniality of power, knowledge and being, on the global colonial subject. In this article we evaluate the contributions Decolonial thinking may offer to International Relations theory, and at the same time, how it may add to other critical theories in order to contribute to the pluriversal dialogue that these authors propos",

      "abstract": "In this essay, I situate Irigaray\u2019s philosophy of sexuate difference between the Heideggerian response to the collapse of the project of Western modernity (\u2018only a god can save us\u2019) and that of decolonial theorist Oscar Guardiola-Riviera (\u2018only Indians can save our modern soul\u2019). First, I return to Heidegger\u2019s theorisation of \u2018planetary technicity\u2019 as the ontology of modernity, arguing, with Heidegger, that in order to respond to this problem we must return to the question of Being. From here, I link Heidegger\u2019s theory of technicity with the work of decolonial theory on the \u2018coloniality of Being\u2019, suggesting that one reason for Heidegger\u2019s pessimism is that he did not think technicity from beyond a Eurocentric perspective. The recent \u2018ontological turn\u2019 in decolonial anthropology that seeks to study Indigenous thought as ontology, however, shows that there are resources for thinking beyond the onto-logic of technicity. Yet, here, I return to Irigaray\u2019s critique of Heidegger for his forgetting of sexuate difference in his analysis of technology to say that a move to a decolonial ontology beyond planetary technicity can only take place if we go through an ontology of sexual difference: because, as Irigaray shows, the onto-logic of technicity that underwrites coloniality and modernity begins in an ontological annihilation of life, sexuate difference, and the maternal debt, the only way to recover this is by thinking the question of sexuate difference. Finally, I conclude by examining the case of the Kogi peoples of Colombia who have warned Westerners that the destruction of the planet can only be stopped if we learn to recompense our common Mother. This case, I suggest, shows how and why the turn to non-Western ontologies as a way out of the death project of modern technicity must reckon with the work of Irigaray",

To illustrate this, the focus is shifted away from the policies of the European Union and UNESCO to the Andean region of Latin America where the notion of interculturalidad is not only a subject on the educational agenda but has also become a core component of indigenous social movements\u2019 demands for decolonization. Part of the argument of this article is that interculturalidad, with its roots in the historical experience of colonialism and in the particular, rather than in assertions of universality, offers a perspective on interculturality that relies on other epistemologies.

We suggest that while postcolonial and related critical theoretical perspectives furthered understandings of the consequences of colonisation, such critical theorising has not provided an epistemological perspective of tourism which legitimises the cosmologies of, and actively empowers, traditionally marginalised groupings. We review published tourism research which adopts critical and postcolonial perspectives, and argue that while these have been valuable in terms of exposing the existence and effects of dominant discourses and practices in tourism, their emancipatory objectives are limited because tourism knowledge is still predominantly colonial. Epistemological decolonisation is thus presented as a more radical project which can provide an \u2018other\u2019 way of thinking, being and knowing about tourism.\n\nKeywords: colonial; decolonisation; decolonial theory; de-linking; epistemological; postcolonia",

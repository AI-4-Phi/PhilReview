      "abstract": "Today in the U.S. we hear a great deal of ballyhoo about \"the triumph of liberal democracy\" and even \"the end of history.\" Yet there is still a great deal to object to in our own \"actually existing democracy,\" and the project of a critical social theory of the limits of democracy in late capitalist societies remains as relevant as ever. In fact, this project seems to me to have acquired a new urgency at a time when \"liberal democracy\" is being touted as the ne plus ultra of social systems for countries that are emerging from Soviet-style state socialism, Latin American military dictatorships, and southern African regimes of racial domination. Those of us who remain committed to theorizing the limits of democracy in late capitalist societies will find in the work of Jiirgen Habermas an indispensable resource. I mean the concept of \"the public sphere,\" originally elaborated in his 1962 book, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, and subsequently resituated but never abandoned in his later work.2",

      "abstract": "Recent rethinking of Habermas' Stntctural Transformatiort of the Public Sphere by Negt and Kluge (1993), and feminist and social historians Nancy Fraser (1993), Joan landes (1988), and Geoff Eley (1992), among others, has argued persuasively that the bourgeois public sphere has, from its inception, been built upon powerful mechanisms of exclusion. The idealized image of a democratic theatre of free and equal participation in debate, they claim, has always been a fiction predicated on the mandatory silencing of entire social groups, vital social issues, and indeed, \"ot any difference that cannot be assimilated, rationalized, and subsumed\" (Hansen 1993b: 198). This is especially clear in the case of those cit izens who do not or wil l not speak the language of civil society. The linguistic terrorism performed with a vengeance during the French Revolution and reenacted in Official English initiatives in the United States more recently, reveal to us how deeply monolingualism has been ingrained in l iberal conceptions of Libert6, Egalit6, anci Fraternit6. But perhaps silencing may not be the best way to describe the fate of linguistic minorit ies or other marginalized groups. For, as Miriam Hansen (1993b) notes, what he more recent work on public spheres uggests i that \"the\" public sphere has never been as uniform or as totalizing as it represents itself to be. Proliferating in the interstices of the bourgeois public -in salons, cofteehouses, book clubs, working class and subaltern forms of popular culture -are numerous counterpublics that give lie to the presumed homogeneity of the imaginary public. Spurred in part by ethnic nationalist movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, speakers and writers of \"barbarous\" tongues and \"i l legitimate patois\" can be seen as one among the counterpublics who avail themselves of any number of \"media\" from novels to oral poetry, from song and regional presses to, more recently, various forms of electronic media to give expression to other kinds of social experience and perspectives on who the public is. what its interests might be, and what its voice sounds like. This article examines the contemporary fbrmation of one such counterpublic",

      "abstract": "In the last two decades, Zimbabwe has faced a series of intractable political and socio-economic crises, resulting in abject economic collapse, stratospheric levels of inflation and massive youth unemployment. The country\u2019s youth have responded to these endless crises through creative artistic expression via music and satirical videos, which are often circulated on social media platforms. This cultural activism by Zimbabwean youth is indicative of the distinctive ways in which the intersections of media globalization and situated local conditions have animated new popular cultural forms by youth in Africa. This paper, harnesses Nancy Fraser\u2019s (Fraser, N., 1990. Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy. Social Text (25-26), 56\u201380) concept of alternative public spheres and Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s (Bakhtin, M., 1984. Rabelais and his world. Translated by Helene Iswolsky. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.) notion of the carnival to analyse young people\u2019s satirical videos posted on social media as creative responses that are used to protest the lived realities of economically marginalized youths even as they articulate significant needs and aspirations of their own. The paper views and analyses social media as a platform that is used to criticise and lampoon post-colonial excesses by the ruling elite who wield political and economic power. Youth popular culture is explored as a platform on which urban youths have sought to highlight and to contest the politics of survival in contemporary Zimbabwe in some highly creative and innovative ways.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the significance of what Jurgen Habermas has called the \"project of modernity,\" seeking to demonstrate the origins of two closely linked social phenomena: the formation of nation-states and the consolidation of colonialism. It examines the role played by techno-scientific knowledge, particularly knowledge that emerges from the social sciences, in the consolidation of these phenomena. The chapter focuses on the role of a critical theory of society in times of globalization. One of the most important contributions of postcolonial theories to the current restructuring of the social sciences is their demonstration that the rise of nation-states in Europe and the Americas from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries was not an autonomous process, but rather one with a structural counterpart. The concept of the \"coloniality of power\" broadens and corrects the Foucauldian concept of \"disciplinary power\" by demonstrating that the panoptic constructions erected by the modern state are inscribed in a wider structure of power/knowledge.",

      "abstract": "abstract Scholars in management and economics widely share the assumption that business firms focus on profits only, while it is the task of the state system to provide public goods. In this view business firms are conceived of as economic actors, and governments and their state agencies are considered the only political actors. We suggest that, under the conditions of globalization, the strict division of labour between private business and nation\u2010state governance does not hold any more. Many business firms have started to assume social and political responsibilities that go beyond legal requirements and fill the regulatory vacuum in global governance. Our review of the literature shows that there are a growing number of publications from various disciplines that propose a politicized concept of corporate social responsibility. We consider the implications of this new perspective for theorizing about the business firm, governance, and democracy.",

      "abstract": "Simon Gikandi\u2019s prizewinning study begins with a reflection on the finality of Derek Walcott\u2019s poem \u201cThe Sea Is History\u201d as the answer that silences the cultural interrogators who ask slave martyrs, \u201cWhere are your monuments, your battles \u2026 / Where is your tribal memory?\u201d (ix). If the sea is the \u201cgrey vault\u201d that has locked these events up, who indeed possesses the cultural keys to decrypt the transatlantic secrets of the Middle Passage? Refusing to accept the social death of the slaves as a given, as Orlando Patterson (1982) asserted many years ago, Gikandi shows the productivity of slavery as a condition structurally present to the texts and artifacts of high culture. Paradoxically, both slavery and taste are visible and invisible counterpoints to each other; neither would be complete without the other as (a partly secret) sharer.While perhaps studied (to death!) more than any other important topic in world history, transatlantic slavery still has many undecrypted secrets, not the least of which is its productivity in terms of cultural history. Gikandi\u2019s book systematically explores socioeconomic and racial coercion, on the one hand, and aesthetic voluntarism and freedom, on the other, as mutually constitutive and structural opposites. In three of six comprehensive chapters, Gikandi demonstrates how aesthetic freedom was defined relative to black slavery; how ideologies of consumption were fabricated by histories of race and taste; and how Caribbean servitude created prestigious art collections owned by plantocratic philanthropists from William Beckford to Christopher Codrington. The second half of the book builds on insights about the structural relevance of aesthetics to New World slave experience, exploring Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Virginian ideas of luxury; the self-fashioning of enslaved subjects, including Olaudah Equiano and Phillis Wheatley; and the celebratory counter-aesthetics of the provision ground, the fair, and the carnival, all imagined by reference to the iron discipline of the plantation.Gikandi\u2019s book rests on a powerful base of previous scholarship on the origins of modernity, the peculiar institution of slavery, and the broader movements of commerce, colonialism, and imperialism. Especially concerning us as literary critics is the cultural half of the equation, which comprises everything from the moral development of the subject, to cross-racial formations and perceptions, to the circulation of ideas about beauty, taste, and pleasure. Gikandi documents more comprehensively than earlier scholars how the rise of aesthetics was conditioned by the racial-economic trajectory of capitalism. His ideology critique proceeds from the elision of African bodies in aristocratic and colonial portraiture to the significance of slavery for white and black self-fashioning. Slavery and the culture of taste are \u201cnonidentical twins,\u201d in Gikandi\u2019s words, monstrous doubles introjected into the maw of modernity, bearing witness to the dialectic between commerce and culture that culminated in the Enlightenment and various emancipations (xii). Would that modernity had so upbeat a conclusion as the plot of his book implies. According to Kevin Bales (1999) and the website slaveryfootprint.org, twenty-seven million people remain enslaved in countries from China to Congo and Pakistan to Peru. Where does such an ongoing reality fit into narratives of modernity and postmodernity, empire and decolonization? This inconvenient truth is the specter that haunts accounts of slavery in the past. Ideology critique takes us only so far.\u25aa \u25aa \u25aaGikandi finds that eighteenth-century aesthetics brings violence, beauty, and emancipation together under one roof. The relations between aesthetics and economics (and more specifically between taste and slavery) were repressive as well as regulatory, interruptive as well as contrapuntal, strictly causal as well as loosely analogical. This seemingly impossible set of contradictions is resolved at a higher level, namely, by a psychoanalytic reading of slavery in the cultural text that Gikandi bases on Nicolas Abraham and M\u00e1ria T\u00f6r\u00f6k\u2019s account of introjection. Unlike J\u00fcrgen Habermas or Simon Schama, who give slavery a laissez-passer as an aberrant but forgettable form of economic exploitation that muddied the high ideals of bourgeois liberation and the autonomy of the self, Gikandi, to his credit, rejects Eurocentric narratives of modernity that ignore slavery and insists that, to be effective and truthful, cultural analysis has to be plurivalent across interpretive dimensions that have been kept apart. The globalizing culture of slavery within modernity arose transversally and was resisted by enslaved individuals through religious cults such as Myal and festivals such as John Canoe (Junkanoo). This important insight is at odds with any reflexive indictment of canonical philosophical texts and cultural artifacts for their parochial racisms and subordinated elisions, an indictment that Gikandi largely eschews. But the wreckage of history assures us no easy choices. Phantasmatic association is just as important as causal logic. The aesthetics of slavery can point to ephemeral phenomena, to organized forms of enchantment, or, above all, to a logic of potential liberation that arises from reappropriative tactics by enslaved subjects who refashion themselves into survivors. In this regard Slavery and the Culture of Taste is a powerful rejoinder to Patterson\u2019s argument concerning \u201cnatal alienation\u201d in Slavery and Social Death, whose title Gikandi\u2019s book ironically rewrites. Cultural politics not only survived the Middle Passage but thrived into syncretic efflorescence. The formerly enslaved became bravura instances of the modern subject, not as vicariously propertied white males but as differently scored agents, whether as the recalcitrant slave woman Nealee profiled in Mungo Park\u2019s Travels; in the guise of Equiano, the consummate professional who was everything from barber to Arctic explorer; or as the beribboned dancers in Agostino Brunias\u2019s ethnographic paintings of Caribbean life.\u25aa \u25aa \u25aaStarting with the high culture of art, literature, and philosophy, the logic of Gikandi\u2019s book leads toward the popular rituals and embodied performances of religion, song, and theatricality, experienced within the architecture of plantations in the Caribbean or the transportation castles in Africa. Their doubleness leads slaves to \u201cthe undoing, warping, unraveling, and even inverting of the imposed idiom\u201d (235). Even the lowly provision ground, granted by the cunning plantocrat as a way to make the enslaved toil to grow their own food on Sundays, becomes the place to fabricate a liberating commercial and communitarian identity, whereby the enslaved share a form of happiness that paradoxically arose out of their exploitation. \u201cArt,\u201d \u201cliterature,\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d are insufficient in their etiologies of modernity. Gikandi\u2019s insight drags us inexorably beyond and outside high culture to the fertile ground of performance.Given the widespread reshaping of the Americas by the institution of slavery, how can Gikandi\u2019s powerful study make common cause with students of slavery and the culture of taste in francophone, hispanophone, lusophone, and other diasporic contexts to avoid reinforcing yet another hegemonic Anglo-American account of modernity, mitigated by a postcolonial inflection? Where indeed is every other country, continent, and language, outside crypto-Hegelian teleologies of Atlantic modernity that lead from slavery to freedom? At the end of the book Gikandi invokes the first inauguration of President Barack Obama as \u201can act that guaranteed that the son of an African was now the custodian of late modernity and its problems \u2026 proof that the catastrophe of history was also the condition of possibility of the idea of human freedom\u201d (284\u201385). While I do not object to the earned poetic license for final reflections, I am prompted to reinterrogate Anglo-Atlantic genealogies of modernity such as Gikandi\u2019s. This last little temptation should be refused by the reader, especially in the slide from legacies of the British Empire to the United States as global hegemon. Do such narratives also distort our world picture with their Occidentalist silence about Asia? Maybe we could remember Obama\u2019s Indonesian childhood to render the narrative more complete, but even then I cannot help wondering whether in 2009 the United States, through its sitting president, merits the sovereign epithet of \u201ccustodian of late modernity and its problems\u201d (284). Walcott is also invoked at the end of the study to sanctify the post\u2013Civil War emancipation proclamation concerning forty acres and a mule (285). Not wanting to end my appreciation of this book with a quibble about Gikandi\u2019s overreach to shift from the legacies of the British Empire to the global sovereignty of the United States, I will reconnect to the Walcott quotation with which Gikandi begins, a better place to start and indeed to return. To say that \u201cthe sea is history\u201d is to shift us, and the tenor of the cultural history of slavery, from territorial sovereignty to oceanic conceptions that are resolutely transcultural and perforce multilingual. The ocean remains the world\u2019s biggest crypt, with many shipwrecks, disappeared bodies, and sea changes, rich and strange. These cultural transformations, still in store for us, feature \u201cthe interlaced experiences of the enslaved\u201d (ix).",

      "abstract": "Abstract \"Public sphre\" is often used by historians of modern Latin America without much concern about its theoretical and methodological implications. Some historians have used it as a model to fit evidence about public debates and politics during the modern period, yet few have engaged it as a theory with deeper methodological and conceptual implications. This article will review the historical literature that has applied Habermas's ideas to Latin American history. Focusing on a few particularly important books, the article will examine potential avenues for research and comparisons. Rather than becoming a new orthodoxy for the study of the region, the theory of the public sphere is establishing a dialogue among historians interested in intellectual phenomena and political discourse (most of them centered on the history of liberalism after independence) and those historians whose interest in social formations have framed their study in terms of hegemony and class domination. The article will argue that a critical use of Habermas's ideas (one that is more systematic about the gender and class exclusions built into the bourgeois public sphere, and that problematizes the connections between the specific development of capitalism in peripheral regions and their embrace of European political traditions) could yield useful results in terms of new research and an inclusive synthesis of recent literature interested in politics, culture and hegemony in Latin America. Notes 1J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (Cambridge, MA, 1991). I am indebted to Tom Klubock, Thom Rath, Federico Sor and Mary Kay Vaughan for their comments on earlier drafts. This article was also discussed at the Columbia University's Department of History graduate faculty workshop and at the New School's workshop of Latin American Studies. I thank Karl Wennerlind, Herbert Sloan, Claudio Lomnitz and Paul Gootenberg for their comments. 2The danger, of course, is that of creating 'un Mapa del Imperio, que ten\u00eda el tama\u00f1o del imperio y coincid\u00eda puntualmente con \u00e9l'. 'El rigor de la ciencia' in Jorge Luis Borges, Obras completas II 1952\u20131972 (Barcelona, 1996). This map will have Mexico as the centre. It is a result of my background and I hope it can be excused as a geographical convention. 3See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures.

See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Discourse ethics: notes on a program of philosophical justification' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (Cambridge, 1990). For the normative implications of the public-sphere model, see Nancy Fraser, 'Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy', Social Text, nos 25/26 (1990). See also Thomas A. McCarthy, The Critical Theory of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, first MIT Press paperback edition (Cambridge, 1981), chap. 1; J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Ciencia y t\u00e9cnica como 'ideolog\u00eda' (Mexico City, 1993). Implicit in Habermas's idea of 'communicative rationality' is 'the central experience of the unconstrained, unifying, consensus-bringing force of argumentative speech': J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, vol. 1, Reason and the Rationalization of Society, trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston, 1984), 10. 5Arthur Strum, 'A bibliography on the concept of \u00d6ffentlichkeit', New German Critique, lxi (1994). Habermas refers to 'seminal theories', like those by Freud and Marx, that 'inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research' resulting in 'hybrid discourses' that may be criticized from the academic establishment but could generate 'new research traditions'. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Philosophy as stand-in and interpreter' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, op. cit., 15. 6The OED provides two examples of the term, both dated 1992. See entries for 'maternalize' and 'nonsensification', Oxford English Dictionary (available online at: http://www.oed.com/). For the parallel with Weber see Joan B. Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution (Ithaca, 1988), 10. 7Habermas links the public sphere with his theory of communicative action at a 'fundamental' level: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Further reflections on the public sphere', Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, 1997), 422, 41. Other scholars, mentioned below, have already suggested the need to confront analyses based on Gramsci and Habermas. 8Habermas's initial definition is tentative and contains the diversity of issues outlined above: 'The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labour. The medium of this political confrontation was peculiar and without historical precedent: people's public use of their reason.' See Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27. See also J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article', New German Critique, iii (1974). On the historical character of the definition, see Moishe Postone, 'Political theory and historical analysis' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit. 9James Van Horn Melton, The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe (New York, 2001), 10, 12. 10For similar agendas see E.

I owe this reference to Samuel Moyn. 14Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27, 55; Melton, The Rise, op. cit.; Daniel Gordon, 'Philosophy, sociology, and gender in the Enlightenment conception of public opinion', French Historical Studies, xvii, 4 (1992), 889, 901; Keith Michael Baker, 'Defining the public sphere in eighteenth-century France: variations on a theme by Habermas' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 202. 15Roger Chartier, The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution, trans.

A similar census would probably be impossible today. See also Peter Uwe Hohendahl, 'The public sphere: models and boundaries' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 108. For an example of these possibilities see Madeleine Hurd, Public Spheres, Public Mores, and Democracy: Hamburg and Stockholm, 1870\u20131914 (Ann Arbor, 2000). 17See a discussion of the implications of this from the point of view of Mexican history in Pablo Piccato, 'Introducci\u00f3n: \u00bfModelo para armar? Hacia un acercamiento cr\u00edtico a la teor\u00eda de la esfera p\u00fablica' in Cristina Sacrist\u00e1n and Pablo Piccato (eds), Actores, espacios y debates en la historia de la esfera p\u00fablica en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico (Mexico City, 2005).

After independence, 'Lo radicalmente nuevo es la creaci\u00f3n de una escena p\u00fablica': Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 13, 23, 87. This parallels Benedict Anderson's claim that 'the convergence of capitalism and print technology \u2026 created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation', and his focus on American Creole identities as early examples of this process. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (New York and London, 1983), 46. Concepts like el pueblo or lo p\u00fablico also had a history that illustrated the incorporation of traditional and modern notions, as explored by Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 'Reflexiones sobre la terminolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica del liberalismo' in Carlos Illades, Brian Connaughton and Sonia P\u00e9rez Toledo (eds), Construcci\u00f3n de la legitimidad pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico (Zamora, 1999). 20Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 30. See Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Penser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (Paris, 1978). For Palti, Guerra's use of Habermas lacked a 'strong' critique of the public-sphere model and failed to recognize Raymond Kosseleck's work as a necessary antecedent. Furet and Cochin were decisive in Guerra's work to strengthen that critique, without embracing 'las teor\u00edas multiculturalistas \"posmodernas\"'. El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 Palti, 'Guerra y Habermas: ilusiones y realidad de la esfera p\u00fablica Latinoamericana' in Erika Pani and Alicia Salmer\u00f3n (eds), Conceptualizar lo que se ve: Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Guerra historiador, homenaje (Mexico City, 2004), 466. 21See Dena Goodman, 'Public sphere and private life: toward a synthesis of current historiographical approaches to the Old Regime', History and Theory, xxxi, 1 (1992), 8, 12. Guerra's explicit rejection of Habermas's Marxism in Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 86n, 87, 14. For studies inspired by Guerra's insights and a closer connection to local contexts, see Francois-Xavier Guerra and Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (eds), Los espacios p\u00fablicos en Iberoam\u00e9rica: Ambig\u00fcedades y problemas: Siglos XVIII\u2013XIX (Mexico, 1999). For the public sphere as part of the politicization of new national societies, see Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez Bernaldo, 'Sociabilidad, espacio urbano y politizaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Buenos Aires (1820\u20131852)' in Hilda Sabato and Alberto Rodolfo Lettieri (eds), La vida pol\u00edtica en la Argentina del siglo XIX: armas, votos y voces (Buenos Aires, 2003), 199. 22Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 12, 101. Such characterization of the socio-economic impact and causes of the revolutions of independence is challenged in John Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750\u20131940 (Princeton, 1988); Eric Van Young, The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology, and the Mexican Struggle for Independence, 1810\u20131821 (Stanford, 2001). 23Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 17, 91, 234. The Habermasian focus on 'a new, autonomous, free, and sovereign public' implies a marked alternative from Furet's Tocquevillian emphasis on associations and modes of sociability as the base for a modern public opinion. Chartier, Cultural Origins, op. cit., 16\u201317. 24Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 52, 99. Guerra's emphasis on culture fits well with older visions of 'Latin American culture' as something clearly identifiable; for Edmundo O'Gorman, this common identity meant that the influence of the United States is negligible in the emergence of a Latin American political culture. Edmundo O'Gorman, 'Hegel y el moderno panamericanismo', Letras de M\u00e9xico, ii, 8 (1939). See Charles Hale, 'Edmundo O'Gorman y la historia nacional', Signos Hist\u00f3ricos, ii, 3 (2000), 17, 24. Absent is a problematization of neo-colonialism as an informal and subordinate mode of entering modernity. See Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi, The Contemporary History of Latin America, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1993). 25McEvoy, La utop\u00eda republicana, op. cit., 11. 26McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit. For similar insights, to be examined below, see \u00c1ngel Rama, The Lettered City, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1996). 27McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit. 28Rafael Rojas, La escritura de la independencia: El surgimiento de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en M\u00e9xico (Mexico City, 2003), 17, 34, 35, 62. 29 ibid., 35.

For recent studies of monarchist sentiment in Mexico see Erika Pani, Para mexicanizar el Segundo Imperio: el imaginario pol\u00edtico de los imperialistas (Mexico City, 2001); El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 Palti (ed.), La pol\u00edtica del disenso: La 'pol\u00e9mica en torno al monarquismo' (M\u00e9xico, 1848\u20131850) \u2026 y las apor\u00edas del liberalismo (Mexico City, 1998). If in the end the new nations rejected liberal monarchism, explains Rojas, it was because of the revolutionary logic of insurgency and the consequent loyalist response, but not because of any inherently democratic feature of the new public sphere. Rojas, La escritura, op. cit., 49. 30Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguilar, 'Dos conceptos de rep\u00fablica' in Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguilar and Rafael Rojas (eds), El republicanismo en hispanoam\u00e9rica: Ensayos de historia intelectual y pol\u00edtica (Mexico City, 2002), 63. See McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit., 43. 31For the 'tradici\u00f3n republicana' as the centre of a long-term political history of Mexico that stresses local and corporative representation over democracy and equality, see Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez Ch\u00e1vez, La tradici\u00f3n republicana del buen gobierno (Mexico, 1993); Antonio Annino, 'Ciudadan\u00eda versus gobernabilidad republicana en M\u00e9xico: Los or\u00edgenes de un dilema' in Hilda S\u00e1bato (ed.), Ciudadan\u00eda pol\u00edtica y formaci\u00f3n de las naciones: Perspectivas hist\u00f3ricas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Mexico City, 1999).

      "abstract": "After considering the proper tone for my participation in this \"dialogue\" between Europeans and Latin Americans about \"Critical Theory,\" I have concluded that my argumentative strategy should primarily be to take seriously the \"subjects\" of the dialogue and their locus enuntiationis: who we are and from where we speak.These sorts of dialogues are not frequent nor are their terms obvious, 1 and it is even less common for such a debate to occur symmetrically, by which I mean that it takes place between philosophers within a community of horizontal communication who are respected as equals, as colleagues, but who nevertheless demand to be recognized in their alterity.Such efforts are not exempt from a certain degree of incommunicability and incommensurability that can create misunderstandings, but are nonetheless united by a solidaristic will to attempt to advance a critical philosophy with global validity.Such a philosophy, which would accordingly set out from the perspective of those excluded from the global system (peripheral countries) and those excluded within particular states (impoverished masses), has not existed to date: I consider its construction the specific task of philosophy in this twenty-first century that we are beginning. The first contacts with the Frankfurt School (with the \"first generation\")As for myself, I participate in what we have called the \"Philosophy of Liberation,\" 2 which since its origin has maintained a constant dialogue with Critical Theory.Just as the events of Paris '68 did not have the same meaning as those in Berkeley, the Latin American context was equally distinct. 3 Paradoxically, under military dictatorships (imposed by the Pentagon and the Kissinger Doctrine between 1964 and 1984), the works of Marcuse -and especially One-Dimensional Mancame to influence us within a context that was similar to the totalitarian horror under which the first Frankfurt School was born (the \"first generation\").The \"dirty war\" which led to the murder, torture, and disappearance of thousands would last almost two decades (as in Brazil, for example). 4 But along with Marcuse, we read the Martinican Frantz Fanon's Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth, 1961), since our reflections were situated in the post-colonial periphery, in the global South.Moreover, our reference point was critical social science -like Dependency Theory, which was later continued by Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory.This global structure of inequality finally burst onto the scene since the Clinton administration under the name of \"globalization\" (which passed from a period characterized by the internationalization of the productive part of capital -as transnational corporations -to a financial and monetarist era with global implications).The point of all this is the following: our first lesson in Critical Theory was non-Eurocentric.My 1975 work Philosophy of Liberation begins thus:From Heraclitus to Karl von Clausewitz and Kissinger, \"war is the origin of everything,\" if by \"everything\" one understands the order or system that the world dominators control by their power and armies [...] I am trying, then, to take space, geopolitical space, seriously.To be born at the North Pole or in Chiapas is not the same thing as to be born in New York City. 5 Through the first Frankfurt School, we discovered \"materiality\" in the sense of living corporeality, a question that does not frequently interest those dealing with the theoretical positions of the School 6 : \"Whoever resigns himself to life without any rational reference to self-preservation would, according to the Enlightenment -and Protestantism -regress to prehistory.\" 7 \"Materiality,\" for the Frankfurt School, consists of an affirmation of living corporality (Leiblichkeit) as in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, which is vulnerable and has desires (Freud), and which needs food, clothing, and shelter (Feuerbach).This anthropological materiality, a far cry from Soviet dialectical materialism, was perceptibly close to our situation in an impoverished, starving, and suffering Latin America.In the Southern Cone, the multitude of demonstrations shouted: \"bread, peace, and work!\" three necessities that refer strictly to life, to the reproduction of its corporeal content (Leiblichkeit).For that reason, the political-economic sphere had a special relevance for us, as did the need for a frontal critique of capitalism (Marx).Will, affectivity and emotions, unconscious drives, and economic requirements were all integrated into the discourse of the first Frankfurt School.But its subject was a \"negative\" materiality, focusing especially on the negative effects of the dominant system, its pain and misery.The \"positivity\" of the system always obscures the \"negativity\" over which it is constructed: \"Hence the convergence of specific materialism with criticism, with social change in practice [...] to abolish suffering.The telos of such an organization or society would be to negate the physical suffering of even the least of its members.\" 8\"Philosophy of Liberation\" set out from the locus enuntiationis of the material victim, from the negative effect of authoritarianism, capitalism, and patriarchy.However, this is the root of a profound divergence with Critical Theory that continues up to the present (and which should be an explicit subject of our dialogue), that of the material negativity of colonialism (of the indigenous peoples, the African slave, the Opium Wars in China, etc.), a phenomenon which corresponds to metropolitan capitalism, Modernity, and Eurocentrism.The victim for us was no longer -as for Horkheimer, Habermas, or the \"third generation\" of Critical Theory -only the worker, the persecuted Jew in Auschwitz, the citizen under Nazism, women, or the working world facing the crisis of the welfare state.We were equally concerned with the victims of a global system (a globalized World-System 9 since 1492), which included the Latin American hacienda system that exploited indigenous people, the mita system of indigenous slave labor which extracted silver (colonial capitalism's first global currency) from mines like that at Potosi in Bolivia, the plantations of African slaves brought to tropical America, the Indian women forced to serve as concubines for the conquistador, the children brought up with Christianity (cultural domination through foreign religion), etc.It was in this context that the ontological category of Totality 10 -so important for Hegel,",

      "abstract": "This paper criticizes the historical-sociological blindness found in contemporary theories of modernity (as in those of Weber and Habermas) in order both to construct a sociological model for the process of Western modernization and to formulate a normative notion of cultural modernity which can favor the development of a critical social theory which is correlatively sociological and philosophical. The historical-sociological blindness regarding the theoretical-political reconstruction of the process of Western modernization is basically characterized by the separation between European cultural modernity and European social-economic modernization, which leads to the notion that European culture is not directly linked to social and economic modernization. Likewise, Western modernization is fundamentally an autonomous and endogenous constitutive process, bearing no correlation with other cultures-societies, as seen in the lack of references to the fact of colonialism. Such a separation between culture and social systems or institutions results in European cultural modernity becoming a pure normative concept with no direct relations to both social and economic modernization and colonialism. That is the reason why, according to Habermas, a critical and universalistic normative concept both to a critical social theory and its political praxis, as to international politics, is allowed. The central argument of this paper is that the theories of modernity cannot provide a normative paradigm to a critical social theory based on cultural modernity due to this historical-sociological blindness. Therefore, the elaboration of a normative concept for critical social theory should start by unveiling, denouncing and deconstructing the historical-sociological blindness of these contemporary theories of modernity.",

Free Software is a set of practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software source code that is made openly and freely available through an unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by demonstrating how Free Software is a \"recursive public\" - a public organized around the ability to build, modify, and maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first place.",

I argue that, as a result of the liberalization and commercialization of the media, a new public sphere has emerged that can no longer be fully controlled by the state but that is increasingly indebted to Pentecostalism. Pentecostalism and video\u2010films come together and articulate alternative, Christian imaginations of modernity. Seeking to grasp the blurring of boundaries between religion and entertainment, I examine the pentecostalite cultural style on which these alternative visions thrive. My main concern is to investigate the specific mode through which Pentecostal expressive forms go public, thereby transforming the public sphere.",

I contend that the Algerian theatrical and musical associations of the reformist period anticipate another kind of civic history: a history of displays of unanimism in public life. I am interested in how and why Algerians learned to produce public displays of agreement for particular audiences (including themselves) at particular historical moments. I emphasize three factors that contributed to the production of unanimity: the achievement of taw\u1e25\u012bd or unity in the Islamic reform movement, vernacular practices of consensus-based argumentation, and French colonial legal and surveillance mechanisms. The essay engages theories of civil society, colonialism, and performance. It draws primarily on material from the French colonial archives for the city of Constantine, Algeria.",

We start with a definition of PCSR, focusing on firms\u2019 contribution to public goods. We then discuss historical antecedents to the debate and outline the original economic and political context. The following section explores emerging changes in the institutional context relevant to PCSR and reconsiders some of the assumptions underlying Habermas\u2019 thesis of the postnational constellation. This highlights some neglected issues in previous works on PCSR, including the influence of nationalism and fundamentalism, the role of various types of business organisations, the return of government regulation, the complexity of institutional contexts, the efficiency of private governance, the financialization and digitalization of the economy, and the relevance of managerial sensemaking. Finally, we discuss the contributions to this special issue and relate them to the newly emerging research agenda.",

In recent years, historians from disparate fields have independently challenged the long-standing sociological view that modernity is characterized by \u201cdisenchantment.\u201d This view, in its broadest terms, maintains that wonders and marvels have been demystified by science, spirituality has been supplanted by secularism, spontaneity has been replaced by bureaucratization, and the imagination has been subordinated to instrumental reason. In the past decade, however, a new historiographic position, if not consensus, has emerged that presents Western modernity as \u201cenchanted.\u201d The ongoing redefinition of such an established view is of consequence for a variety of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the master narratives underlying the stories that historians choose to tell. As Dipesh Chakrabarty usefully reminds us, \u201cThe moment we think of the world as disenchanted . . . we set limits to the ways the past can be narrated.\u201d1 The emergent view that modernity is as enchanted as it is disenchanted may conjure alternative vistas to the historical imagination, and at the very least offers the possibility of pulling new rabbits out of old hats. Narrating a historiography of \u201cmodernity and enchantment\u201d has limitations of its own, however. Those historians who challenge the equation of modernity with disenchantment often present their views within the context of topical debates in their respective fields. It will therefore be useful to tease out some of the common concerns and findings that have appeared in otherwise distinct areas of study, such as the histories of science, religion, and mass culture. The works examined here are necessarily eclectic, drawn primarily from European and American histories of these subfields, but they are nevertheless representative of how the topic is currently being handled across historical specialties. A second challenge has to do with defining such inherently vague and complex terms as \u201cmodernity\u201d and \u201cenchantment.\u201d Taken separately, each term has manifold meanings. When the two terms are paired under a particular interpretation of the relationship between \u201cmodernity and enchantment,\u201d however, each assumes greater",

      "abstract": "Abstract In most approaches to measuring democracy, the underlying assumptions are highly a-historical and a-cultural. This article is a critique of such approaches and provides the outline for an alternative interpretation. It argues that different histories and cultures produce different democracies. Conventional measuring paradigms are insufficient to adequately measure progress towards democracy in postcolonial settings. The article offers four arguments as to why democracy in the postcolony will not, and cannot, develop in a similar fashion to those in the North American and Western European settings. It focuses on the different historical trajectories of state construction; the limits of the postcolonial state in terms of its domestic capacities; the positioning of emerging market economies and democracies in the global financial system; and, finally, the variety of cultural conceptions of the proper relationship between community and individual. These four factors ensure that postcolonial democracies will differ in their trajectories from those of their Western counterparts. The article concludes that it is high time to 'democratize democracy', so that postcolonial attempts at creating democratic systems are given equal weight in the debates concerning progress towards democratic regimes and that different trajectories and conceptions of the meaning of democracy are take into account in Western democratic discourse.

Robert Dahl, Polyarchy (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1971). Dahl outlines eight criteria which he thinks define an institutional democracy. These criteria include the freedom to form and join organizations, freedom of expression, voting, eligibility for office, competition for votes, alternative sources of information, fair and free elections, and accountable institutions. These eight criteria shape much of the political science debate concerning the definition of democracy and provide the basis for an entire industry of political analysis that concerns itself with measuring the 'quality of democracy'. See, for instance, Markus Crepaz and Vickie Birchfield, 'Global Economics, Local Politics', in Markus Crepaz, Thomas Koelble, and David Wilsford (eds), Democracy and Institutions (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2000), pp. 197\u2013224. 9. The term 'postcolony' in this article is used in its widest sense. We refer here to nations where processes were put into place that did not encourage the emergence of rights-bearing citizens but of subjects; where a state structure was put in place for the extraction of resources and surplus value for foreign rather than domestic benefit; where economic sovereignty was not established; and where notions of subjectivity developed that do not coincide with Western notions of individual rights and preferences. While these developments took place largely in colonial contexts (most of Africa and Latin America, and much of Asia), there are some states, nations, and spaces where such developments also took place without the establishment of a conventional colonial super-structure (e.g., Eastern Europe after 1945). For a discussion of the term see Achille Mbembe, On the Post-colony (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2001). 10. The term 'habitus' is borrowed from Pierre Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998) to suggest that the politics of democracy is a mutually constituting interaction of structures, dispositions, and practices. On this account, the politics of democratic governance is a result of the way institutions work (e.g., NGOs, judicial system) and of the embodied dispositions toward governance engendered by a people's historical experiences. Functionally, the structures of governance and embodied (and thus situated) knowledge of those structures shape enduring orientations to action which serve to reproduce those structures (which is why postcolonial governance often reproduces a colonial-like model). However, neither the structures of governance nor citizen's political practices and responses mechanistically follow from those orientations. They are also produced by a process of improvisation which is, in turn, defined by a nation's cultural orientations, the constraints it must overcome, the personal trajectories and capacities of its politicians, and the ability of its people to engage in politics 11. We employ the term inflected modernity to indicate that the varied paths taken by the postcolonial countries will be deeply and persistently influenced by EuroAmerican concepts of modernity, but will critically diverge from that EuroAmerican version according to their own specific histories. 12.

And for this reason we have adopted the notion of the habitus which assumes that agents employ schemes that are informed, but never determined, by their structural position and by their acts of position-taking within a field of action. The expression of agency in respect to these structuring forces is thus variable, and subject to the political labours of agents to gain more freedom. While political leaders such as Mandela certainly make a difference in establishing democratic benchmarks, at this historical juncture, the structural limits imposed on emerging democracies in emerging market societies are such that the attainment of Western democratic standards becomes difficult. This is precisely because the structures laid down by apartheid and the structure of the global economy today often place constraints on liberal democratic practices and attempts to realize its emancipatory goals. While it may be tempting to position Mandela as a champion of democracy and Mugabe as his opposite, it should be recalled that Mugabe was, for several years, the 'poster boy' of IMF reforms and seen as a model African leader by much of the Western press. The collapse of the Zimbabwean economy in its transition from autarchy to a globally open economy is at the heart of the current political debacle and less an example of poor agency as of blinding structural constraints on an agricultural economy that followed IMF prescriptions and paid a heavy price for that mistake. For an analysis of the development of the Zimbabwean crisis see Bond (note 44). 73. There are reports that, in the period February 2006 to May 2007, some 200,000 households have moved from townships to suburbs in the metropolitan areas of South Africa. These households are referred to as 'Black Diamonds' and constitute the core of the 'new black middle class'. The size of this new black middle class is the subject of much controversy with some observers claiming that it constitutes well over three million individuals and others arguing that it is much smaller. See Sunday Times Business Times (Johannesburg), 20 May 2007, p. 1. The point is that it has taken over a decade for such a class of individuals to emerge and for that class to move from township to suburb. 74.

Similarly, the issue of rationality in the postcolonial environment should be subject to a much more careful analysis than the knee-jerk reaction of Western modernists who are quick to dismiss value and religious systems of beliefs as superstition. Clifton Crais' (note 42) magisterial analysis of witchcraft beliefs in the Eastern Cape establishes that these beliefs have much to do with the politics of misfortune and trying to root out 'evil' in impoverished communities. 78.

We discuss the deliberative model of democracy in view of the attempts of a coalition of 'traditional leaders' to appropriate the model for their own ends in a paper titled 'Deliberative Democracy and the Politics of Traditional Leadership in South Africa', currently under review with another journal, as well as in our chapter quoted above (note 75). There are several interpretations of a model of deliberation at work, and we argue that only one subject to vigilant oversight institutions at the provincial and national level as well as vibrant local participation is capable of producing democracy worthy of the name. The 'deliberative democracy' model certainly resonates with rural community traditions in Africa and could provide the basis for a more indigenous (as well as inclusive) form of democracy.

      "abstract": "Planning theory has shifted over time in response to changes in broader social and philosophical theory as well as changes in the material world. Postmodernism and poststructuralism dislodged modernist, rational and technical approaches to planning. Consensualist decision-making theories of the 1980s took forms of communicative and collaborative planning, drawing on Habermasian concepts of power and society. These positions, along with refinements and critiques within the field, have been hegemonic in planning theory ever since. They are, in most cases, presented at a high level of abstraction, make little reference to the political and social contexts in which they are based, and hold an unspoken assumption that they are of universal value, i.e. valid everywhere. Not only does this suggest important research methodology errors but it also renders these theories of little use in those parts of the world which are contextually very different from theory origin\u2014in most cases, the global North. A more recent \u2018southern turn\u2019 across a range of social science disciplines, and in planning theory, suggests the possibility of a foundational shift toward theories which acknowledge their situatedness in time and place, and which recognize that extensive global difference in cities and regions renders universalized theorising and narrow conceptual models (especially in planning theory, given its relevance for practice) as invalid. New southern theorising in planning is drawing on a range of ideas on societal conflict, informality, identity and ethnicity. Postcolonialism and coloniality have provided a useful frame for situating places historically and geographically in relation to the rest of the world. However, the newness of these explorations still warrants the labelling of this shift as a \u2018southern theorizing project\u2019 in planning rather than a suggestion that southern planning theory has emerged.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The public sphere is a pivotal concept in democratic theory. Conventionally, it is framed in a local/national context. In the classic Habermasian formulation, the public sphere is predicated on national media, a sovereign state, and participatory citizenry. However, under conditions of globalisation, the nation-state paradigm is subject to increasingly significant challenges. The advent of the network society is also destabilising the institutional foundations of the national public. These developments necessitate a reassessment of the public sphere as a territorially delimited realm. A reconstruction of Habermasian theory reveals how global interconnections may be providing the structural preconditions for the emergence of transnational public spheres. The categories of flows are threefold: communicative networks, governance networks, and activist networks. In certain issue-areas, all three preconditions may coalesce to produce an environment suitable for the emergence of transnational public spheres. However, the potential for the realisation of 'borderless' public spheres is circumscribed by key factors. Global communication is systematically distorted, global governance is democratically deficient, and the norms of critical publicity are difficult to sustain amongst highly differentiated virtual audiences. Unless these issues are addressed, the early promise of transnational networks as an emancipatory force will be neutralised. La esfera p\u00fablica es un concepto esencial en la teor\u00eda democr\u00e1tica. Convencionalmente, se ha conceptualizado tanto en un contexto local como nacional. En la cl\u00e1sica formulaci\u00f3n habermasiana, la esfera p\u00fablica se predica a trav\u00e9s de los medios nacionales, un estado soberano y una ciudadan\u00eda participante. Sin embargo, bajo las condiciones de la globalizaci\u00f3n, el paradigma de naci\u00f3n-estado est\u00e1 sometido a retos significativos que van en aumento. La entrada de la sociedad en red est\u00e1 desestabilizando tambi\u00e9n las bases institucionales del p\u00fablico nacional. Estos desarrollos necesitan un replanteamiento de la esfera p\u00fablica como un dominio territorialmente delimitado. Una reconstrucci\u00f3n de la teor\u00eda habermasiana revela c\u00f3mo las interconexiones globales pueden proveer las precondiciones estructurales para el surgimiento de esferas p\u00fablicas transnacionales. Las categor\u00edas de las corrientes se dividen en tres: redes comunicativas, redes gubernamentales y redes de activistas. En ciertas \u00e1reas con problemas, todas las tres precondiciones tienen que fundirse para producir un ambiente adecuado para el establecimiento de las esferas p\u00fablicas transnacionales. Sin embargo, el potencial para la realizaci\u00f3n de las esferas p\u00fablicas 'sin fronteras' se circunscribe por factores claves. La comunicaci\u00f3n global es distorsionada sistem\u00e1ticamente, la autoridad global es democr\u00e1ticamente deficiente y las normas de la publicidad cr\u00edtica son dif\u00edciles de sostener entre audiencias virtuales altamente diferenciadas. A menos que se resuelvan estos problemas, la promesa inicial de las redes globales como una fuerza liberalizadora, ser\u00e1 neutralizada.

Notes 1 Of course, Habermas's substantial oeuvre cannot be easily summarized, but there have been interesting linkages with the themes of STPS in his later work. For example, he has conceded the salience of contemporaneous counter publics during the bourgeois era (1992b), and considered the ambiguous implications of new media for discursive democracy (1998). He has argued for new democratic steering mechanisms to be developed in the nascent 'postnational constellation' and shown particular interest in the potential of the European Union to develop constitutional solidarities (2000). He has also continued to assert that presently 'the necessary infrastructure for a wide-ranging generation of diverse public opinions exists only within the confines of nation states' (Habermas, 2001 Habermas, J. 2001. Why Europe needs a constitution. New Left Review, : 5\u201326. [Google Scholar], p. 18). 2 Fraser (2005) Fraser, N. 2005. Transnationalizing the Public Sphere, http://www.republicart.net/disc/publicum/fraser01_en.htm [Google Scholar] also claims that classical public sphere theory presupposes the existence of a Westphalian national economy subject to state regulation, a national language, and a national literary culture. 3 It is also important to note that transnational deliberative spaces were manifest during the eighteenth century, indicating that networking forms of social organisation have historical precursors. See Aravamudan's (1999) Aravamudan, S. 1999. Tropicopolitans: Colonialism and Agency, 1688-1804, Durham, NC: Duke University Press.

It is my contention that new potentialities for emergent transnational public spheres arise when network structures become the prevailing modalities of organisation in contemporary society. As will be seen, the unique qualities of ICT such as the Internet are instrumental in invoking these prospects. 4 Mitzen (2005) Mitzen, J. 2005.

State Interests and Public Spheres: The International Politics of Jordan's Identity, New York: Columbia University Press. [Google Scholar] have applied a public sphere perspective to inter-state relations. Although they offer interesting insights, I argue that the radical potential of public sphere theory is curtailed when it neglects non-state actors, particularly those at the margins of society. Historically, subaltern counter publics have been fertile sites of political activism and emancipatory transformation. 5 The extent of this transformation is matter of controversy, ranging from assertions of the continuing primacy of the state to claims of its demise (Held & McGrew, 2003 Held, D. and McGrew, A. 2003.

      "abstract": "In this paper we advocate and demonstrate the value of science fiction as a potent way of \u2018practicalising philosophy.\u2019 Science fiction narratives provide an ideal-typical setting through which theory can be represented, clarified and developed. They also help us link the abstraction of theory and the messiness of practice, while partly side-stepping the enigma whereby any study of the empirical world may merely reflect back the particular ontologies and epistemologies that constitute that world. In particular, we claim that the television series Star Trek provides a powerful metaphor for understanding and teaching certain themes regarding modernity, including the possibility of universal progress through economic expansion (capitalism, colonialism), technological development (industrialism, positivism), and the possibilities for universal emancipation (democracy). We especially focus on the Borg Collective, a form of life that has become one of the most enduring and critical mirrors that Star Trek has held up to contemporary society, and which can be usefully understood as a metaphor for the dark side of instrumental rationality. The paper draws on the various encounters between the Enterprise and the Borg to illustrate and engage with the diverse writings of Weber, the Frankfurt School, Habermas, Foucault, and Haraway on modernity\u2019s continuing and ambivalent struggle with instrumental rationality.",

LET ME BEGIN BY FOREGROUNDING the term modernity that is employed in this essay, which can be defined as \"the force of Western cultural expansionism against which individuals have to contend, in order to dwell in this world.\" In this rather succinct sentence, I want to evoke the long history of this concept, its complex trajectory that originated in Europe, the birthplace of modernity, its journey across geo-political borders, and its ability to penetrate and transform discursive formations in every corner of the world. Although it may seem today like a commonplace, it bears repeating that the emergence of the \"modern\" also coincided with the heyday of Western colonialism, transforming all aspects of life in the conquered territories . My aim, here, is not simply to examine the legacy of French colonialism in Vietnam, but to focus on the ways the natives, today, are negotiating their passage into modernity. I want to stress the fact that modernity is an on-going project in many emerging countries, which makes manifest my agreement with Habermas' argument that modernity is an incomplete project in the West. I also want to shift the focus away from an analysis of the \"natives\" as silent subalterns oppressed by this omnipotent cultural force, toward a more dialogic reading of these \"modern subjects\" as agents who are active participants in the transformation of these emerging modern societies and are negotiating, in imaginative ways, their place within the postcolonial space of cities such as Hanoi or Saigon. The notion of \"(alter)native modernities,\" as it has been articulated suggestively by Dilip Gaonkar, with its emphasis on the plurality of modern experience, is certainly relevant to my discussion.2 But unlike my colleagues in the social sciences, who are able to distinguish the different processes of modernity as distinct categories (the political, the economic, the Vol. XLI, No. 3 73 L'Esprit Cr\u00c3\u00a9ateur social and cultural), my analysis blurs these distinctions in order to identify and understand \"the emergent social forces and contradictory processes which are reshaping modern societies today.\"31 proceed by juxtaposing different discourses (filmic, architectural, political) in the hope of achieving a montagelike effect that aims to suggest the spatial disorientation and temporal discontinuity that also characterize the experience of those who \"dwell in modernity,\" a term that is indebted to the work of Martin Heidegger and echoes Dipesh Chakravarty's most recent study.4 Marshall Berman's classic text, All That Is Solid Melts Into Air, published almost 20 years ago, has also influenced my thinking about the \"experience of modernity,\" the notion of \"makfing] ourselves at home in this [modern] world\" and \"being at home in modernity.\"5 I am not, however, suggesting a facile analogy between the Bronx of the 1950s and contemporary Hanoi and Saigon. I also take issue with Berman's claim that \"nineteenth-century Russia [i]s an archetype of the emerging twentieth-century Third World\" (175). What interests me here is the way Berman describes the process by which modern men and women are not only objects of modernization but subjects who negotiate their place in this modern world of capital, a concept that intersects with what Homi Bhabha has called the \"unhomely,\" which he describes as \"a paradigmatic colonial and postcolonial condition.\"6 As a way of illustrating this...",

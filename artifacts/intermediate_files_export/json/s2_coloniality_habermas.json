      "abstract": "2024 was a jubilee year for the Frankfurt School. On July 24, the Institute for Social Research (Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung), the birthplace of critical theory, marked its centennial. A month earlier, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, who is often seen as the intellectual leader of the second generation of the Frankfurt School, celebrated his 95th birthday. In Germany, these overlapping anniversaries have been met with the publication of a number of books on Habermas and the critical theory tradition more generally. Despite the globalization of theorizing within the tradition of the Frankfurt School over the past 50 years, much of its intellectual history of it is still produced in Germany by German scholars based on sources and archives held in the Federal Republic. This Spotlight reviews the main findings and conclusions of this literature for an international, English-speaking audience. It concludes by reflecting on whether critical theory has succeeded\u2014and if so, how.",

This addresses Habermas\u2019s knowledge-constitutive interests and communicative action for redressing societal pathologies, and Honneth\u2019s work on (mis)recognition, (dis)respect,\u00a0and social justice. In doing so, the article argues for broadening the scope and embrace of mixed methods research, to go beyond being empirical research only or largely, and to include theorisation, critical theoretical discourse and its analysis, and ideology critique, as legitimate methods for (transformative) mixed methods research. The article makes a case for these methods as constituting important research methods in themselves in the portfolio of mixed methods research, moving the boundaries of mixed methods research beyond solely empirical studies, and providing emancipatory lenses and consciousness-raising in recognising that transformation takes many forms.",

The size of the truth of science that Habermas cannot accept when there is Comte's limitations by legitimizing and justifying science through empirical fact research with standardization that has been determined through methodological prerequisites and norms. Habermas with his critical theory rejects this view because there is knowledge that cannot be measured by positivist research methodologies such as community communication and emancipation. On the other hand, Habermas also rejects the notion of value-free science such as Comte's testimony in his positivism because it has indirectly co-opted science with an interest that no longer has objectivity values, but is full of interests.",

After presenting his early critique of technocratic consciousness, I will contend that the main problem of Habermas\u2019 conception of technology lies in the conflation of \u201ctechnology\u201d with \u201ctechnical rationality\u201d. Feenberg criticizes Habermas\u2019 position for implicitly depoliticizing technology. By developing a distinction between \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201ctechnique\u201d, I will argue that Habermas\u2019 position does not exclude a critical theory of technology. The emergent picture will combine Habermas\u2019 emphasis that technology is more than a historical project with Feenberg\u2019s optimism on the possibility of an emancipatory reorientation of technology.",

CSR is understood as a form of corporate responsibility that involves social concern for the environment in order to strengthen its positive image in society. However, some companies distort the concept of CSR towards branding, which is considered by the majority of society as a manipulative act. In Habermas' communication theory, CSR is one form of communicating the social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions on certain groups in society as a whole. And from an Islamic perspective, CSR branding can be communicated effectively and is permissible as long as it does not violate Sharia principles such as honesty, transparency, and avoiding things that contradict Islamic values",

However, the study used critical and analytical methods. \u201cUjamaaism\u201d is a new term coined by the author to explain the socialist theory of Nyerere. The study found that critical social theory elements were in a good position to correct the \u201cUjamaaism\u201d of Nyerere to be a more useful theory because it failed to realise its expectations. It follows that the critical social theory of Habermas was in a good position to have the best correction for reinstating \u201cUjamaaism\u201d praxis in Tanzania because of its nature of critical consciousness, critical reflection, enlightenment, autonomy as well as emancipation, which help human being to come out from all social restrictions and conditionalities that hinder them from reaching self-awareness. These values were not much reflected by Nyerere, as a result, the study aimed to re-create the \u201cUjamaaism\u201d of Nyerere",

Drawing from the theoretical contributions of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Louis Althusser, Kwame Nkrumah, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Guy Debord, the analysis demonstrates how Trump\u2019s economic and militaristic declarations perpetuate global capitalist dominance. His rhetoric exemplifies the colonization of the lifeworld, the operation of ideological state apparatuses, and the spectacle of power, all of which work together to reproduce and legitimize neo-colonial exploitation. The synthesis of these critical theories provides a comprehensive critique, highlighting the ideological and structural mechanisms that sustain global inequalities and calling for a praxis of resistance towards a more equitable global order.",

      "abstract": "This introduction to the special section \u201cCritical Theory after Frankfurt\u201d reflects on recent demands to reorient Frankfurt School Critical Theory in the wake of its centennial toward the critique of political economy, capitalism, colonialism, militarism, and the climate crisis. It reviews concerns that critics have raised about J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s inheritance of Critical Theory, and it considers several of the alternative paths proposed for charting the Frankfurt School\u2019s future. It argues that, in place of simply reviving the Critical Theory of the 1930s and 1940s, Critical Theory\u2019s reorientation should also consider its diffuse receptions and trajectories among abolitionist, feminist, and left-wing activists and intellectuals in the United States, beginning with the student voices of 1968.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the relevance of J\u00fcrgen Habermas' theory of communicative rationality and discursive ethics as a philosophical framework for understanding and resolving inter-civilizational conflicts. Using a critical-hermeneutic approach, the study analyzes the concept of communicative rationality, which emphasizes the importance of equal dialogue, and discursive ethics, which demands inclusivity in decisionmaking processes. Case studies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, climate change through the UNFCCC, and the Alliance of Civilizations initiative demonstrate how Habermas' theory can be implemented to createinclusive and solution-oriented dialogue. The main findings reveal that power imbalances and cultural biases often hinder the creation of a genuine global public sphere. However, applying Habermas' theory can address these challenges through community-based deliberative mechanisms, cross-cultural education, and digital technologies. The paper recommends strengthening international institutions, utilizing social media as a deliberative space, and developing education rooted in local cultures. Thus, Habermas' theory proves to be relevant as both a philosophical and practical foundation for building global peace.Nevertheless, its successful implementation requires adaptation to contemporary challenges, such as disinformation and the dominance of powerful actors in international relations.",

      "abstract": "This paper defends the claim that Habermas\u2019s distinction between the moral and the ethical depends on some un-stated assumptions that he is not willing to accept. One of the assumptions concerns the presumption of the equality of the discourse participants; the other implicit assumption in his discourse theory of morality concerns the issue of reciprocity and symmetrical power relations. He takes each discourse participant as free to initiate a dialogue and to challenge the validity claims of discourse participants. Such assumptions undermine Habermas\u2019s commitment for ethical neutrality and his rejection of the substantive notions of truth. He argues that although our everyday interactions are pervaded by distortions and asymmetrical power relations there are operative principles such as reciprocity and symmetrical power relations inherent in language. The question precisely is: why should we take the principles that are inherent in language for granted? It appears as though Habermas has a pre-given reason to endorse the principles in question. By disapproving the use of threat, coercion and intimidation in the process of argumentation, and instead by insisting for the employment of, among others, symmetrical relation, Habermas is affirming the claim that humans are beings that command each other\u2019s respect. But the question precisely is, why do they command each other\u2019s respect? It appears that we cannot commit ourselves to this claim without affirming a given ontology of the human and Habermas is exactly doing that.",

      "abstract": "This book shows how critical theory can help school leaders and administrators to prepare students for the ever-changing political, cultural, economic, and societal conditions of the world. The contributors use ideas from critical theorists including Adorno, Fromm, Marcuse and Habermas and connect them with contemporary theories and debates in educational leadership from moral education to critical theories on race, to culturally relevant practice.\n The book challenges the misconceptions of many present-day educators about the analytical lens offered by the Frankfurt School theorists which is often dismissed by policymakers and practitioners. Written by leading scholars based in the UK, USA, and Canada, the contributors emphasize and explain the importance of educational aesthetics, dialectics, education and civilization, the structural transformation of education\u2019s place in the public sphere, and education as revolution and enlightenment.",

      "abstract": "This paper offers a postcolonial re-examination of Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness through the intersecting critical lenses of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\u2019s seminal essay, \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d and Leon Festinger\u2019s theory of cognitive dissonance. It interrogates the colonial epistemology that governs Marlow\u2019s narrative and highlights the deep psychological and ideological contradictions embedded in his perception of imperial violence. While Marlow witnesses the horrors of colonialism, he remains epistemically confined within the ideological boundaries of empire, rendering him incapable of truly understanding\u2014or representing\u2014the colonized subject. The novella thus becomes a text of silences, where indigenous voices are consistently muted, distorted, or erased. Drawing on Spivak\u2019s notion of the subaltern and Festinger\u2019s theory of internal conflict, the paper argues that Conrad\u2019s narrative not only marginalizes the African other but also exemplifies the structural and psychological silencing of colonized peoples in Western literature. By situating Heart of Darkness within the discourse of epistemic violence and postcolonial dissonance, this study reframes the novella as a site of both complicity and critical tension\u2014where the limits of colonial understanding reveal the urgency of speaking, and listening to, the subaltern voice. \nKey Words: Postcolonialism; Cognitive Dissonance; Subaltern; Epistemic Violence; Colonial Discourse; Marlow",

The novel was published in 2017, which is possessed by the number of 'subalterns': Hijras, women, political revolutionaries, and poor people facing silence. The sexual, social, and religious minorities are equal to 'Dalits' in experiencing segregation and abuse by the dominant indigenous groups. They are considered 'Untouchable' and pushed into the circle of 'Others'. Even though they are fighting segregation and marginalisation, they cannot truly speak. The research aims to discover how the agency of 'subalterns' is snatched in India by those who are phrased as the 'elite'.",

By alluding to postcolonial thinkers such as Edward Said, Ghandi, Spivak, and also Giorgio Agamben\u2019s notion of inclusive exclusion, the essay focuses on the evidence from the novel to indicate that there is no space from which the subaltern of the novel can be heard. The research utilizes the precepts of postcolonial criticism to examine the possibility of considering any room for the voice of the subaltern in The White Tiger for being heard. Through a close reading of the text, also, the study addresses the alterations in the character of the protagonist which ostracize him from the league of the subaltern.",

What is the place of translation in self-representation? How do instances of textual citation complicate the self of self-representation? In the ricochet between citation and translation, language matters not necessarily as a sign of fluency, but as part of a pragmatics of critique, positionality, and ultimately solidarity. Each instance of language-use (German, Italian, Arabic) highlights the potentials of re-use, citation, and re-imagination for consolidating the bonds of anticolonial struggle and a vision of a postcolonial future. Shifting from translation to resonance and from language to voice, the essay ultimately engages the poetic potentials of translation as part of a pragmatics of anticolonial solidarity, integral to and beyond the self at the heart of self-representation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The contribution of postcolonial writing to our understanding of precarity lies in its post-structuralist emphasis on the question of representation so that the act of representing precarity becomes discursively precarious. Gayatri Spivak\u2019s foundational essay \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d provides us with conceptual tools to problematize what may be called \u201cdiscursive precarity\u201d \u2013 that is, that set of enunciative conditions in which intellectuals speak on behalf of the precariat \u2013 but also run the risk of silencing them by substituting subaltern voices with their own. The article explores Derek Walcott\u2019s Omeros as a poem of discursive precarity by examining a rhetorically unstable double-movement, wherein the poet-narrator\u2019s identification with, and alienation from, the subaltern is dialectically and irremediably mediated by his own position of privilege. Paradoxically, the poem can only achieve legitimacy through the acknowledgement of its lack of legitimacy to sing of, and for, the subaltern.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In studying the global spread and implementation of liberal norms, scholars have moved from linear notions of norm diffusion and promotion to an emphasis on norm contestation. Contestation by the supposed beneficiaries and addressees has taken centre stage in both research on the norms that underpin global governance and in studies on democracy promotion and liberal peacebuilding. While the impetus of this scholarship is normative \u2013 to overcome the taken-for-granted nature of liberal norms \u2013 the concept of contestation itself is mainly used with an analytical interest. Yet, as we show in this article, contestation also comes with \u2013 oftentimes implicit \u2013 normative connotations. Focusing on the seminal work of Milja Kurki, Oliver Richmond, Antje Wiener, and Amitav Acharya, we reconstruct these normative connotations. It turns out that the normative take on contestation is fairly conventional in all four approaches. Contestation is largely seen as a means to enable dialogue, as illustrated by Acharya\u2019s metaphor of the Banyan tree. Fundamental conflicts over liberal norms (\u2018battle scenes\u2019) are either not considered or seen as normatively undesirable. As a way forward, we propose a typology that enables scholars to empirically analyse contestation in its different expressions and suggest two strategies to normatively assess practices of contestation.",

A central argument in his theory, the co-originality thesis suggests that human rights and democracy are not only both fundamental and mutually supportive, but also \u2018equi-primordial\u2019 and internally related. Reconstructing Habermas\u2019s argument as it has developed over two decades, I argue that his account of constitutional democracy has difficulties accounting for the enmeshment of constitutional and international human rights, while his three-tiered model of global governance, in the absence of democratic legitimation, amounts to a downgrade of the currently institutionalized practice of international human rights. Instead, I suggest that shifting the focus from ideal global institutions to actual processes of domestic contestation, through which groups appropriate and apply international legal norms in order to claim their rights, provides a plausible account of the practice of international human rights consistent with the co-originality thesis.",

      "abstract": "Copyright law currently forces all intellectual production into a doctrinal model shaped by individualistic assumptions about the authorial ideal. To the extent that the truly original author-owner is conceptualized as an individual (and not a function or fiction), he depends upon Enlightenment ideals of individuation, detachment, and unity. A competing view of the author sees her as necessarily engaged in a process of adaptation, translation and recombination. This version of authorship coheres with a view of the individual as socially constituted: her expression is the result of the complex variety of texts and discourses that she encounters (and by which her subjectivity is shaped). The tension between competing constructions of authorship thus mirrors a larger tension between competing constructions of the self. Feminists have struggled to find a conception of the self that acknowledges social embeddedness without precluding individual autonomy or creative capacity. The process of authorship encapsulates the tension between the autonomous self and the society in which she exists, because the materials of authorship are both given and created. Employing the tools of feminist dialogism and relational theory, I hope to show that we can re-imagine the author not as source, origin, or authority, but as participant, citizen. These ideas illuminate the nature of authorship as a social and formative process, but they also offer the foundation for a coherent justification of copyright: copyright law, which aims to encourage creativity and exchange, should thereby encourage participation in cultural dialogue and facilitate the relations of communication that are central to this conception of selfhood and society.",

      "abstract": "The article explores the use and importance of taking a biographical approach to conducting participatory action research (PAR) with asylum seekers and refugees in order to: better understand lived experiences of exile and belonging; contribute to the important field of Biographical Sociology; provide a safe space for stories to be told; and in turn for these stories to feed in to policy and praxis. The authors\u2019 combined work on the asylum-migration nexus, the politics of representation and participatory action research methodology (PAR) as ethno-mimesisi argues for the use of biography to contribute to cultural politics at the level of theory, experience and praxis, and is constitutive of critical theory in praxis. PAR research undertaken with Bosnian refugees in the East Midlands and Afghan refugees in London will be the focus around which our analysis develops. We develop a case for theory building based upon lived experience using biographical materials, both narrative and visual, as critical theory in practice towards a vision of social justice that challenges the dominant knowledge/power axis embedded in current governance and media policy relating to forced migration. The dominant power/knowledge axis related to forced migration is embedded in current (New Labour) governance and re-presented in some media texts as identified below. New Labour governance is symbolised in the competing discourses of a) strong centralised control and b) more open systems, network and partnership based governance (Newman, 2003: 17-23; Clarke, 2004; Lewis, 2000). Open systems are made up of partnerships and networks \u2013 \u201cjoined up government\u201d, \u201cthat transcends the vertical, departmental structures of government itself\u201d (Newman, 2003: 20). to develop or foster a consensual style of governing. Progressive governance is defined by Newman (2003:15) as involving a significant shift from governance through hierarchy and competition to governance through networks and partnerships with an emphasis upon inclusion. Progressive governance involves the production of techniques and strategies of responsibilisation of citizens operationalised through the development of networks, alliances, and partnerships, with a strong focus upon active citizenship. Thus, spreading responsibility for social control to non state agencies and \u201ccommunities\u201d (Garland, 2001). In relation to forced migration/asylum discourses around the exclusion of the \u201cother\u201d (involving criminalisation, detention and deportation) and the maintenance and control of borders (developing ever more tighter controls on entry and asylum applications) exist in tension with discourses that speak of human rights, responsibilities and possibilities for multi-cultural citizenship especially in the community cohesion literature. There is a conflict at the heart of New Labour\u2019s approach to asylum policy linked to the \u201calterity\u201d of the asylum seeker that promulgates hegemonic ideologies and discourses around rights to belonging and citizenship, perceived access to resources (redistribution) and misrecognition fostering suspicion of the \u201cstranger\u201d. Alongside discourses of fairness and rights to enter and seek refuge, there exist regressive discourses that water down the vitally important actual and symbolic 1951 UN convention, and foster a split between \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cgenuine\u201d refugees, making it extremely hard to seek asylum in the UK.",

Rather than limit itself to intellectual history, the focus here is on a more enduring theme: the double-bind of hospitality which the natural lawyers encountered in seeking to find a place for the welcome of the foreigner in the \u2018law of nations\u2019. Although these thinkers agreed on a natural right of communication, this proved destabilising, even destructive, of the property claims by which hosts establish their domain as properly theirs in the first place. All struggled with this double-bind, though this took different forms, from the concern that the law of hospitality might thereby justify colonial appropriation to fears for how it could threaten sovereignty. Two thinkers arguably find a way out of the double-bind of right of communication-right of property in hospitality, but sacrifice the law of hospitality in the process: Pufendorf, subordinating communication to property, turns hospitality into charity and thereby effectively denies it status as a law of nature; Kant, putting communication first, makes hospitality a matter of right, not philanthropy, but also sees it as instrumental to the development of a global civil condition, where it would be redundant.",

This endeavour is motivated by the insight that any theoretical framework that is committed to the emancipation of the human condition needs to identify the normative grounds on which both its critique of social domination and its pursuit of social liberation can be justified. Just as Habermas\u2019s firm belief in the possibility of human emancipation manifests itself in the concept of the \u2018ideal speech situation\u2019, his radical critique of human domination cannot be separated from the concept of \u2018systematically distorted communication\u2019. Although the significance of these two concepts for Habermas\u2019s communication-theoretic approach to the social has been widely recognised and extensively debated in the literature, their overall importance for a critical theory of human empowerment and disempowerment has hardly been explored in a satisfying manner. Drawing upon Habermas\u2019s communication-theoretic conception of human coexistence, this paper makes a case for the view that a comprehensive critical theory of society needs to account for both the emancipatory and the repressive potentials of language if it seeks to do justice to both the empowering and the disempowering potentials of the subject.",

      "abstract": "This book reviews Internet research and political theory seeking theoretically \"cool-headed\" perspectives on the current public political spaces in advanced societies. Aspects of the political theories of Rawls and Habermas are discussed and contrasted with contestation-oriented theories. In light of how the Internet takes part in structurally transforming the public sphere, the book draws on sociological and realist insights in order to encircle a more realist view. It briefly reconsiders such strange bedfellows as sociological systems theory (Niklas Luhmann) and political realism (eg. Bernard Williams). The purpose is not to construct a realist theory of the internet-based public sphere, but to point out central insights on which such a theory can be built.",

When brought into question, such an inference becomes a claim defended by showing sound reasons for the selection of backing pertinent to a shared context. Legitimation controversies ensue when an attributed consensus meets objection. It is argued that attention to legitimation controversies renders the Toulmin model a more useful critical paradigm for investigating the development and risks of communicative reasoning in a public forum. The nomination of John Tower as Secretary of Defense is employed to illustrate how critical analysis of legitimation controversies reflexively expands the domain of inquiry for informal reasoning.",

      "abstract": "It is today customary for educators and philosophers to maintain that the learning of certain fundamental normative principles \u2014 such as fair treatment, respect for the equality and dignity of individuals as rational persons, the fostering of autonomous and critical reflective judgment, reciprocity of rights and obligations, mutual recognition of informed interests and well-being \u2014 comprises an essential form of internalization or appropriation of values that must be aimed at by any genuine form of moral teaching. These principles, it is claimed, are constitutive of the very sense of morality as a normative framework and coming to learn what they mean and do is a requirement of any justifiable conception of the enterprise of moral education. To assert these views is, of course, one thing; to justify them in a noncircular manner is another. The question of justification is philosophically and educationally vital here since we understand the morality of judgment and action to be conceptually linked to the justification of beliefs and conduct in distinctly moral terms. I want to argue here that morality \u2014 understood in normative rather than simply descriptive terms \u2014 is inescapably and at its core an epistemic enterprise. Minimally, to normatively claim that an action is morally justified is to claim it is the morally right thing to do in virtue of its permissible, obligatory or altruistic character given the circumstances. And to claim moral rightness is to claim that one is justified in making that claim. Hence, to fail to justify the second-order principles and norms appealed to within the justification of first-order beliefs and judgments is to fail to satisfy an essential requirement of both morality and its respectful transmission to others within educational contexts.",

      "abstract": "Western European states are faced by societies with increasing ethnic, cultural and religious diversity as a result of migration flows. Advocates of multiculturalism have tried to address these potential challenges by advocating the accommodation of minorities within the recipient society. This study argues that the normative and practical measures suggested by multiculturalists tend to be de-contextualised and rest on a static understanding of identity formation and of culture. The dissertation aims to develop an explicitly transformative approach to multiculturalism. This approach is called \u201ccaring multiculturalism\u201d. First, the author outlines a theoretical and normative framework which focuses on the possibilities to achieve social and cognitive change. Then, this framework is tested by evidence from three empirical cases which are analysed comparatively. Specifically, the empirical study looks at the institutional and narrative opportunities provided by the municipalities of Malm\u00f6 in Sweden, Birmingham in Britain, and Bologna in Italy, to adopt caring multiculturalism. First, the analysis examines the mechanisms of political participation provided to migrants by each municipality in order to gauge the extent to which migrants are formally included in the recipient society. Second, it studies the narratives expressed by public actors and in policy documents. It examines each municipality\u2019s immigrant policies and assesses how migrants\u2019 integration is narratively constructed and how migrants are constructed in relation to the majority society. This examination of the institutional and narratives opportunities supplied by the municipalities to include migrants in the polity is the body of evidence for assessing if, and in what ways, caring multiculturalism can be adopted in the cases. Finally, the dissertation considers which factors favour the adoption of caring multiculturalism, and which ones constrain it, in the light of the empirical analysis.",

Yet for decades academic international relations (IR) did not consider time worthy of research or reflection. Recently things have changed, especially in critical IR, where scholars developed numerous arguments about time\u2019s political importance. However, none of that work pursued a synoptic account of time in IR theory. This chapter does so, using an ideal typology of closed and open time to understand realism, liberalism, constructivism, English School, feminism, Marxism, and critical theory. In each, tensions between open and closed time distinguish the theory from its competitors but also animate explanatory and normative debates among its proponents. The historically overlooked issue of time\u2014our assumptions about it, visions of it, and claims about how it impacts politics\u2014drives theoretical development across and within IR theories, which we can understand as attempts to time international political life.",

I answer that his conception of \u201cGod\u201d is resolutely postmetaphysical, a god that is constructed by way of human linguistic practices. I then give three reasons for why it should not be embraced by contemporary critical social theory. First, in the domain of practical reason, this conception of transcendence excludes by fiat any \u201cOther\u201d to communicative reason, blocking possibilities for mutual learning. Second, due to the same exclusion, it risks reproducing an undesirable social order. Third, it is inadequate for the purposes of a critical theory of social institutions.",

      "abstract": "This thesis examines how multifaith initiatives have been implemented as cosmopolitan strategies to counter global risks\u2014such as terrorism and climate change\u2014and advance common security in ultramodern Western societies. This study is among the first to employ Ulrich Beck\u2019s (2006:91-94) model of \u2018methodological cosmopolitanism\u2019. Consequently, it incorporates a local\u2013global focus, examining the rise of the multifaith movement in Victoria, Australia within a broader \u2018global\u2019 framework of Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). Despite the rise of the multifaith movement and of multi-actor peacebuilding networks at the turn of the 21st century, they have received scant attention in the sociological literature. I aim to address this omission by examining the ultramodern rise of multifaith engagement from the perspective of social movement theory and cosmopolitan theory. I argue that the rise of the multifaith movement in ultramodernity, alongside other social movements of this period, provides a missing narrative within the sociological literature, which is comprised of cosmopolitan peacebuilding religious responses aimed at collaboratively countering global risks. In addition, by documenting these peacebuilding aspects of the ultramodern resurgence of religion, I contribute new evidence to further challenge the secularisation thesis. By drawing on 54 interviews with expert professionals in the field of multifaith relations gathered for this research project and by comparing previously published material with this new data, I identify four principle aims and six characteristics of the multifaith movement, examine the benefits and challenges of multifaith engagement and explain the role of multifaith initiatives in countering processes of radicalisation. Finally, by building upon cosmopolitan theories, I propose a new theoretical framework that I term netpeace. Netpeace recognises the interconnectedness of global problems and solutions and the capacity of multi-actor peacebuilding networks\u2014in which religious actors engage both critically and collaboratively with state actors\u2014to overcome the most pressing risks of our times. This study can thereby assist in building new models of activism and governance, as outmoded, oppositional frameworks of modernity are being replaced by new ultramodern, cosmopolitan possibilities, founded on a politics of understanding modelled by the multifaith movement.",

It cautions against a conceptualization of judicial dialogue as a means to foster commonalities between courts and to legitimize judicial governance. The argument develops from an idealized notion of a \u2018transnational judicial public sphere\u2019. In this sphere, domestic, regional and international courts ideally form common opinions through dialogue and pursue common purposes. The danger of this understanding is to construct a new paradigm that not only overlooks important differences in the interest, influence and opinion of courts, but also overstates the socio-normative significance of exchanges between courts and of judicial governance in general. The critical potential of judicial dialogues lies less in the formation of commonalities or in the legitimization of judicial authority than in bringing alternatives and a plurality of opinions to the fore.",

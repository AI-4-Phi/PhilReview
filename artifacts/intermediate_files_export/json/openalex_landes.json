      "abstract": "One of the most persistent cleavages in the social sciences is the opposition between two lines of thought conveniently associated with Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, between homo economicus and homo sociologicus. Of these, the former is supposed to be guided by instrumental rationality, while the behavior of the latter is dictated by social norms. In this paper I characterize this contrast more fully, and discuss attempts by economists to reduce normoriented action to some type of optimizing behavior. Social norms, as I understand them here, are emotional and behavioral propensities of individuals. Are norms rationalizations of self-interest? Are norms followed out of self-interest? Do norms exist to promote self-interest? Do norms exist to promote common interests? Do norms exist to promote genetic fitness?",

      "abstract": "When the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, they believed that under socialism the family would 'wither away.' They envisioned a society in which communal dining halls, daycare centres, and public laundries would replace the unpaid labour of women in the home. Yet by 1936 legislation designed to liberate women from their legal and economic dependence had given way to increasingly conservative solutions aimed at strengthening traditional family ties and women's reproductive role. This book explains the reversal, focusing on how women, peasants, and orphans responded to Bolshevik attempts to remake the family, and how their opinions and experiences in turn were used by the state to meet its own needs.",

      "abstract": "From the early 19th century, the European debate over the slave trade and slavery pioneered a new international discourse in which the concept of free labor defined a universalistic standard for the conduct of Europeans in colonies and non\u2010European societies. Implementing free labor, however, entailed a confrontation with the particular work culture and values of local communities, from ex\u2010slaves to independent peasants. This article examines the connection between imperial powers' critiques of each others' conduct\u2014and the role of international fora in defining imperial morality\u2014and their encounter with African social structures. Colonial states were inextricably drawn into confronting Africans as social beings: first in trying to induce them to become disciplined wage workers, then to contain the conflicts unleashed in places of work and urban residence. By the 1940s, this meant exporting to Africa European approaches to containing class conflict. Colonial cities became less the realm of the colonial expert and more that of the \u201cindustrial relations\u201d specialist, who argued against migratory labor and in favor of taking Africans out of their cultural milieu and reproducing their families under the eyes of European welfare experts, even if this implied paying family wages or family allowances that exceeded the free market price of labor. Only with decolonization did France and Britain take themselves out of the social and political intimacy of the workers' milieu and participate in a new\u2014or rather old\u2014international discourse on the moral and social virtue of the free market.[labor, migration, reproduction, slavery, welfare, decolonization]",

They are based on specific assumptions and conventions that delineate their appropriate objects and methods of study. Historians, like scholars in other fields, including the so-called \u201cnatural sciences\u201d, do not simply record some objective reality that exists independently of their taken-for-granted ideas about the nature of that reality. Rather, their decisions as to which subjects and events will be objects of study and how they will be conceptualized are shaped both by widely accepted philosophical tenets and common-sense understandings of the nature of human society.",

      "abstract": "This article will deal with one aspect of feminist research and teaching about international law in the post-Soviet era: the need to think about international law ethically in ways that take account of how international lawyers are located in global networks of power. While international law has long been involved in \u201cthe organisation of power relations between white and \u2018other\u2019\u2019\u2019, it is particularly important in an era of global economic restructuring to study international law as a process that is implicated in the reproduction of inequality. As Andrea Rhodes-Little suggests: For feminists \u2026 the further challenge thrown down by \u201cother\u201d women is that of how to resist those social practices which produce inequality and divide women against each other within a global context as well as in local contexts. In short, feminists search for ethical practices which are answerable for the power relations they produce. We also search for law which acknowledges its position in the organisation of power relations between women and women and between white and \u201cother\u201d. My argument about the need for \u201cethical\u201d practices of teaching and research about international law, practices \u201cwhich are answerable for the power relations they produce\u201d, can be read as part of a larger debate about the need to reorient legal education and the production of knowledge about legality generally. It also draws on the work of those feminist and critical theorists who argue for the development of an ethical approach to education and to the production of knowledge in areas such as literary theory and cultural studies. The particular focus of this article is on the ways in which that approach to teaching international law can be explored through the inclusion, in international legal curricula, of material that questions the central notions of citizenship and sovereignty. In the first section, I will sketch some of the ways in which feminist theorists have attempted to ask a different set of questions about citizenship and sovereignty, by contesting the dominant conception of the citizen as a neutral disembodied individual, and by considering the implications of citizenship in a global context. Secondly, I will make some necessarily brief comments about teaching method, addressing the pedagogical issues that are raised when feminist, critical and postcolonial material is included in the law curriculum.",

Milton's poems and even his prose have most often been contextualized with reference to the higher reaches of literary history; here they are placed in more unfamiliar contexts: certain seventeenth-century women's writings, the emerging discourses of feminine conduct, and the discourses of 'news' produced in and around the Civil War. I show how both Milton and women writers struggle to come to terms with the implications of the new and powerful ideological formulations which result from the explosion of print culture which produces these texts.

      "abstract": "Both terms of my topic may not generally be held in clear focus. I will therefore begin with names of some of those I take to be, by their main accents, representative of each of two perspectives. Civilization analysis stands for Max Weber, Norbert Elias, Louis Dumont, Benjamin Nelson, S. N. Eisenstadt. History of consciousness is represented by Michel Foucault, Philippe Aries, Hayden White, Fredric Jameson, H. D. Harootunian. The second list could be greatly expanded: it points to a currently fashionable approach. Most of those listed (to their own credit) are not pure representatives of one of these perspectives. Foucault in his substantive works on madness, clinicalization of medicine, and imprisonment is almost as much a civilization analyst as historian of consciousness. Among those who can be identified with civilizational approach, Elias (in his studies of the civilizing process) is closest to history of consciousness, Eisenstadt wholly alien to it. Shifts occur over time. Dumont in his later work on European political philosophy has moved toward history of consciousness, as have several others. Any movement in opposite direction is barely perceptible. I have chosen to compare these two scientific programs because, first, both are important to civilizational studies, capable of grasping what is essential to civilizations as distinguished from other entities, and second, both are more than merely technical disciplines, rather constituting broad intellectual and human orientations. It is not possible to be a cultured person, in sense in which nineteenth-century east Europeans used term, without having become deeply engaged with both history of consciousness and civilization analysis. I will focus on two tendencies both of which may exist in same author, but which carry him or her in different directions. I will touch upon their logics, phenomenologies, points of contact, and critical evaluations.",

      "abstract": "This essay accounts for the recent prominence of women's writing in Greece by examining how women writers applied writing strategies developed under the dictatorship (1967\u201374) to their critique of fixed gender roles. Margarita Karapanou's novel Kassandra and the Wolf deconstructs the victor-victim opposition and poses the process of inversion itself as a position from which to write. Jenny Mastoraki's collection of poems Tales of the Deep works out a similar perspective formally, suggesting that such a position requires that the order of language also be disturbed. By analyzing these texts in the historical context of the dictatorship and in the theoretical contexts of feminist works such as Christa Wolf's Cassandra and Luce Irigaray's Speculum of the Other Woman , I show how Karapanou's and Mastoraki's responses to censorship are not individual exceptions but key components of recent Greek women's writing.",

      "abstract": "The thesis seeks to examine the nature of the Australian transportation system through&#13;\\nan assessment of the the records of 330 convicts transported between 1800 and 1845.&#13;\\nThese individuals were selected on the basis of their colonial experience: they all&#13;\\nabsconded from their place of servitude and spent a period of time illegally at large&#13;\\nunder-arms. Known generically as the bushrangers of Van Diemen's Land. these&#13;\\nconvicts have maintained a high profile in Australia's historical tradition. However, few&#13;\\nattempts have been to distinguish between the mythical elements of that tradition and the&#13;\\nreality of convict bushranging.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nChapter One is reserved for an assessment of the historiography of bushranging.&#13;\\nChapter Two examines the convicts in the data set in terms of their human capital. It is&#13;\\nargued that the stereotype of the bushranger prevalent in the literature is not supported&#13;\\nby an analysis of the convict indents. It is maintained that the bushrangers were&#13;\\nrepresentative of the convicts who arrived in Van Diemen's Land over the period of the&#13;\\nstudy. The chapter assesses the potential utility of the bushrangers as unfree workers.&#13;\\nChapter Three examines the economic rationale of transportation. It seeks to investigate&#13;\\nits origins and apply recent developments in the literature of unfree labour to Van&#13;\\nDiemen's Land. In particular. three key areas of the economy are addressed: the&#13;\\noperation of the labour market; the labour extraction process and the allocation of unfree&#13;\\nworkers to job openings. Chapter Four tests the theoretical approach adopted in the&#13;\\nprevious chapter and provides an interpretation of the interaction between convicts,&#13;\\nprivate employers and the state. The purpose of Chapter Five is to make a critical&#13;\\nassessment of previous attempts to locate convict bushranging within the political&#13;\\neconomy of early white Australia. It will demonstrate the shortcomings of previous&#13;\\nstudies in this area and outline a fresh approach. Chapter Six will explore this theme in&#13;\\ngreater depth. Drawing on the findings of the previous chapters it will provide a new&#13;\\nanalysis of bushranging which throws fresh light on the operation of the convict system&#13;\\nin Eastern Australia.",

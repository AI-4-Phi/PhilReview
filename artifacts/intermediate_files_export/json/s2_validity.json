      "abstract": "This theoretical article proposes using J\u00fcrgen Habermas's theory of communicative action (TCA) as a normative instruction for texts intended for science popularization (SP). We used TCA approaches, such as the validity claims that should characterize argumentative debate and the interactive processes with \u2018lifeworld\u2019 components (culture, person and society), to create a theoretical relationship between Habermas's theory and SP practices. We propose that the TCA aligns with the objectives of a dialogic communication about science with the non-specialist public and can contribute to perspectives that emphasize dialogue about science in society. We conclude that the premises of communicative action can guide SP policies.",

      "abstract": "Debates within critical educational theory and its relation to capitalism have often been heavily influenced by the tradition of critical social theory. For instance, Jurgen Habermas\u2019 communicative action approach has proven to be a valuable theory that combines both analytical considerations regarding the conflict between the \u2018lifeworld\u2019 and \u2018system\u2019, and a decisively normative theory for deliberative and democratic discourse. However, Habermas\u2019 communicative action does not go without problems, as a critical linguistic approach may prove. As such, in this paper I attempt to analyse the issues of communicative action in the context of anti-capitalist discourse and debate within and about higher education. To do this, I first outline Habermas\u2019 and Fleming\u2019s theories on the colonization of higher education, followed by a critique by means of Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of language. As such, I attempt to argue that, in order to decolonize higher education from the \u2018logic of capital\u2019, we must reflect upon the language-games used when speaking about education.",

Patients\u2019 organizations represent an important link between individual patients and the health system. Social theories are increasingly being used to explain doctor\u2013patient\u2013system interactions, expanding understanding beyond the mere clinical perspective. In this sense, patient involvement in HTA can also be considered through the Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action. From a Habermasian perspective, HTA as part of the instrumental rationality contributes to an increased efficiency of resource use within the system; however, such rationalization threatens to colonize the lifeworld by making it \u201cincreasingly state administered with attenuated possibilities for communicative action as a result of the commercialization and rationalization in terms of immediate returns.\u201d Using Habermasian system/lifeworld framework, this paper explores opportunities and obstacles to patient involvement in HTA, whereby trying to understand current and possible roles of patients\u2019 organizations as a mediating force between HTA as a function of the system and the lifeworld represented by patients.",

      "abstract": "This article contributes to understanding the role and position of worker cooperatives in society, providing a socio-political explanation to their existence as well as conceptual tools that can be used to imagine and implement economic democracy practices. It uses and complexifies Habermas\u2019s social theory and its separation between system and lifeworld to show that cooperatives may act, intentionally and idealistically, at the interface of these two domains. This positioning enables cooperatives to participate in resisting colonization of the lifeworld by endowing individuals with resources favouring communicative action and by redefining institutional arrangements within the system. This article identifies factors explaining the varying degrees of resistance to colonization by cooperatives. It also contributes to theorizing the potential effects of organizing work in an economically democratic way.",

We build on the concepts of lifeworld and systems, developed in Habermas\u2019 theory of communicative action. The discussion is supported and enriched by the work of Feenberg and van Dijck, integrating insights from Science and Technology Studies and media studies. Technology philosopher and critical Science and Technology Studies scholar Feenberg introduces technology as a steering \u201cmedium\u201d that delinguistifies and possibly colonizes the lifeworld by reinterpreting media sociological perspectives of Habermas, Marcuse, Latour, and Callon. In a similar way, media scholar van Dijck analyses the transition from human connectedness to automated connectivity in the context of social media. We then illustrate the delinguistification and the colonization of lifeworld with a systematic analysis of the contingent evolution of Facebook as one particular case in social media. We focus on three specific artifacts in Facebook, framed as obligatory passage points: EdgeRank, Sponsored Stories, and Gatekeeper. Each of them gives an idea how the private space is subsumed under the commercial space and how the colonization reconfigures the public space in social media like Facebook. In this sense, we complement the political economy analysis of prosumer commodity with the action-theoretical autonomist approach of immaterial labor, highlighting new potential threats of the current social media development.",

The global integration of CGAIS, however, bears various risks, including the one of colonizing the social through data. In this article, we are interested in the colonization of a new territory: that of conversations. We therefore investigate the nature of conversations individuals have with these technologies. Following Habermas, the realm of the communicative is what enables to construct a common social world, a lifeworld. Conflating the communicative and the instrumental threatens lifeworld construction and more broadly our democracy. We explore CGAIS technical and conceptual properties, and show that they do not support communicative action. Rather, CGAIS should remain confined to the realm of instrumental action. Yet, as they give the impression to belong to the realm of the communicative, we conceptualize them as colonialist agents. Notably, they are imperialist agents because they are increasingly used for all types of activities at work and in the private and public spheres. This reduces the space for communicative action. In addition, they are derealization agents as they distort conversation, by giving the illusion of communicative action. As a result, they threaten the co-construction of a common lifeworld, that forms the basis of our democratic societies.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the relevance of J\u00fcrgen Habermas's thought in understanding the phenomenon of modern spirituality and the social dynamics of Generation Z in the digital era. Using a qualitative research method with a philosophical-analytical approach, this study examines Habermas's central concepts such as communicative action, the public sphere, the lifeworld, and discourse ethics. The results indicate that modern spirituality, which is personal and fluid, serves as a form of cultural resistance against the colonization of the lifeworld by the instrumental rationality of economic and bureaucratic systems. Meanwhile, Generation Z faces significant challenges within a digital public sphere that is often distorted by algorithms, polarization, and misinformation, which hinders the establishment of rational and deliberative communication. The study concludes that Habermas's theory provides a crucial normative framework for revitalizing healthy dialogue, constructing emancipatory digital ethics, and assisting Generation Z in restoring the depth of life's meaning amidst the pressures of the modern system.",

      "abstract": "\n This article examines J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 concept of communicative power and describes how it transforms into political power in actual decision-making. For this purpose, the article develops the use of Habermas\u2019 typology of validity claims in communicative action as a framework for analysis. This means analyzing how public performances invoking these validity claims affect actors\u2019 authority, which is then capitalized in policymaking. The article thus integrates Habermas\u2019 procedural view on deliberative politics with the more culturally oriented view on political performances. It also contributes to the discussion about the \u201cmediatization of politics\u201d by introducing a communicative perspective to complement the more common institutional and systems perspectives. This theoretical and analytical approach is illustrated by examples drawn from evidence in 16 semi-structured interviews conducted with participants in the policy networks involved in the 2015 Finnish labor market negotiations.",

      "abstract": "The contemporary proliferation of \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d and \u201cecho chambers\u201d seems to render obsolete the notion of a public sphere in the singular. In my article, I would like to argue against this view: Following J\u00fcrgen Habermas, \u201cthe public sphere\u201d can be understood as the concomitant horizon of communicative action, while the latter permeates society as a whole. On the basis of this socio-philosophical approach, the omnipresent tendencies toward fragmentation appear as reactive attempts to ward off this socially established and context-transcending context of discussion. Habermas himself, however, has never adopted this perspective. Instead, he interprets the various symptoms of the decline of the public sphere\u2014including its fragmentation\u2014as the result of a \u201ccolonization of the lifeworld\u201d by economic, bureaucratic, and technological system logics. However, on the basis of the concept of \u201csystematically distorted communication,\u201d which was still crucial for Habermas\u2019s early work, it is possible to reconstruct how the lifeworld context of communicative action, out of which the public sphere emerges, is not only corroded and cut through from the outside by system logics but also exhibits its own dialectic of the refusal of discourse and the overcoming of this refusal. The fragmentation of the public sphere that we are confronted with today can be theoretically interpreted and politically addressed as a precarious standstill of this dialectic.",

      "abstract": "While the critique of neoliberalism, as the form of contemporary capitalism, has been advanced from Marxian and Foucauldian perspectives, it has had limited attention from the perspective of Critical Theory. Largely unrecognized is the suitability of the theory of reification for this critique, specifically, Habermas\u2019s version. This article reconsiders Habermas\u2019s colonization thesis as the basis for a critical theory of neoliberalism, refining its theoretical framework to deepen its critical diagnosis. Against the dismissal of the system\u2013lifeworld concept, a novel critique is advanced to suggest its original elaboration fell confusedly between two versions of social systems theory. Drawing from late developments, the scheme is reinterpreted as distinguishing two forms of communication in capitalist society: delinguistified and linguistic. This opens the way to reframe and communicatively transform colonization as relinguistification; that is, the translation of monetary coding into ordinary language such that communicative action is distorted from within by reifying concepts.",

Thus, the design of responsibly autonomous agents faces an essential tension: these agents must both (1) respect applicable norms and (2) deviate from those norms when blindly following them may lead to diminished outcomes.\n\n\n\nWe propose a conceptual foundation for norm deviation. As a guiding framework, we adopt Habermas's theory of communicative action comprising objective, subjective, and practical validity claims regarding the suitability of deviation.\n\nOur analysis thus goes beyond previous studies of norm deviation and yields reasoning guidelines uniting norms and values by which to develop responsible agents.",

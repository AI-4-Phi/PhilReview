      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Among mainstream political philosophers, Charles Mills is probably best known, not as the author of The Racial Contract, but for his long-running critique of ideal theory and Rawls for his association with it. Yet the critique of ideal theory that followed the publication of The Racial Contract is prefigured in that very work, where we find in inchoate form what would be further developed later on. In the book, this early formulation of the critique occupies a small part of a larger, more general argument condemning mainstream political philosophy for the way that it has ignored race. In this paper, I explore the relation of the critique to this more general argument. It might be thought that the general argument leads inevitably to the critique of ideal theory. I will argue that this is not so. I will show how Mills\u2019 more general argument can be made without taking the further step of critiquing ideal theorizing. The blame for why mainstream political philosophy has ignored race, and continues to ignore race, I will argue, should be placed elsewhere.",

As remarkable in its scope as in its perspicacity, the book re-envisions modern political theory by centering its racialized constitution and imbrications in Euro-American practices of racial exploitation. Taking a half-millennium of global white supremacy as its point of departure, it both exposes racial divides encoded within social contractarianism and lays the groundwork for a non-ideal theory of justice, conjoining a penetrating critique of white domination with a methodologically innovative liberalism. This chapter (a) situates TRC\u2019s main arguments within their contexts of emergence, (b) considers certain lines of criticism to which it has been subjected, along with Mills\u2019 adaptations to them, and (c) reflects on its downstream impacts, in terms of Mills\u2019 own trajectory and of the discipline\u2019s grappling with race.",

      "abstract": "This essay argues that Charles Mills\u2019s normative vision for racial justice\u2014a reformed, race-attentive liberalism\u2014is fundamentally self-undermining because it embraces the liberal property form. Specifically, I show how Mills\u2019s insistence on the practical utility of the property form for racial justice ignores both W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s signal warning about the reactionary power of propertied interests and how the hegemony of Lockean liberalism is a key mediator of racial/colonial domination in the United States. The essay first shows how Mills\u2019s anti-racist, social democratic liberalism relies on and legitimizes a property rights framework. I then analyze Du Bois\u2019s critique of liberal abolition-democracy during Reconstruction, surfacing how white propertied interests constantly threaten progressive gains and social democratic change. Building on Du Bois, I argue that Mills\u2019s reformed liberalism, by preserving the property form, places racial justice on an inherently unstable foundation while also excluding struggles for Indigenous sovereignty. Finally, I question Mills\u2019s pragmatic argument for restricting racial justice to a reformed liberalism. Mills\u2019s \u201cBlack radical liberalism\u201d is not as straightforwardly practical as he suggests because of the deep historical hold of Lockean, rather than Kantian, liberalism. Here, I excavate how hegemony around Lockean liberalism in the United States has been periodically reconsolidated, looking at the interwar and Cold War context as well as the deeper influence of Locke on US constitutionalism. Ultimately, against a politics that restricts racial justice to a social democratic horizon, I contend that it is necessary to challenge the liberal property form in the pursuit of racial justice and Indigenous sovereignty.",

Mills suggests that the vision of contract defined by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan comes much closer than its Lockean and Enlightenment successors to understanding the physics of power: the relationship between the texts of contracts and the kinetic forces that they regulate. In this essay, I develop a framework for a counter-history of the racial contract by locating Hobbes' Leviathan in the timeline of a slave-trading contract called the Asiento de Negros. As texts and contexts for each other, Leviathan and the Asiento de Negros suggest how the history of the racial contract evolves in relation to a kinetic relationship between the forces of race war and racial capitalism as defined respectively by Michel Foucault and Cedric Robinson. Peace was one name for this kinetic relationship, as I show through a reading of the Anglo-Spanish peace treaty signed at Madrid in 1667. Leviathan and the Asiento both explain the combination of historical forces that drives this treaty from within \u2013 their absence from its juridical exterior helps explain how the race of peace and peace of races advances the contradiction between white supremacy in its de facto and de juro manifestations.",

      "abstract": "This essay sets out to show that (1) the seemingly contradictory claims in the first part of Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment on aesthetics as well as the relation between Kant\u2019s aesthetic and the Third Critique\u2019s second part on the teleology of nature turn out to be completely coherent if we look at them through the lens of Charles W. Mills\u2019s The Racial Contract. The essay argues that Kant\u2019s Third Critique is not only implicitly based on a differentiation between truly human beings as opposed to subhuman human beings; much rather, said differentiation is explicitly elaborated on in Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment. The essay then (2) shows that the racial differentiations around which Kant\u2019s Third Critique revolves cannot be restricted to Kantian aesthetics. Much rather, Kant\u2019s conceptualization of the disinterested subject of aesthetic experience as a distinctively civilized being structures Western aesthetic theories to this very day. This is why the essay then (3) proceeds to show why it is not enough to acknowledge the exclusions of Kant\u2019s aesthetic and to grant everybody access to the kind of aesthetic civilization towards autonomy that Kant restricted to a few white gentlemen of taste. Much rather, the autonomous, detached, and disinterested subject that is at the center of Kant\u2019s aesthetic needs to be thoroughly questioned in favor of a heteronomous, relational subject. In conclusion (4), I argue that the transformation of the autonomous subject into a vulnerable and dependent being also raises doubts as to the plausibility of Mills\u2019s Black Radical Liberalism that revolves around a subject whose Kantian autonomy Mills hardly ever questions.",

      "abstract": "Global relations are largely shaped by what Charles Mills calls \u201cthe racial contract\u201d: the sometimes explicit and sometimes unspoken agreement that social arrangements must favor whites over nonwhites. This bias is strong among white political philosophers and especially in the liberal contractarian theories of Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Kant, and, most recently, Rawls. While these theories pay lip service to nominal equality in the name of universalism, they also ignore the inequality and disadvantage that nonwhites suffer at the hands of whites, and thus they contribute to epistemic obscurantism and racial domination. In this paper, first, I strengthen Mills\u2018s argument by providing an even more convincing objection against the procedural requirements of John Rawls\u2018s theory of justice; second, I argue that this objection gives us a good reason to distinguish between Rawls\u2018s liberal contractarianism and other theories in white political philosophy that are far more sensitive to Mills\u2018s critique; and, finally, I offer a partial defense of Martha Nussbaum\u2018s and Amartya Sen\u2018s capability\u2013based approach, which I think is uniquely situated to address the inequalities of the racial contract.",

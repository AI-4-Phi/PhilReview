====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers Enrique Dussel's sustained philosophical critique of
Habermas's communicative ethics and discourse theory from the standpoint
of Latin American philosophy of liberation. The central debate concerns
whether communicative rationality — as developed by Habermas following
Apel — already presupposes and systematically excludes those who are not
full members of the "communication community": the colonized, the poor,
and the victims of the modern world-system. Dussel's Ethics of Liberation
(published in Spanish in 1998, English 2013) is the pivotal work, offering
a systematic alternative built on three principles (material, formal, and
feasibility) that prioritizes the "living subject" — the suffering body of
the victim — over the formal conditions of discourse. The Apel-Dussel
debate of the 1990s is the most direct philosophical exchange, conducted
through a series of essays (partially collected in the 1996 Humanity Press
volume). Habermas himself never directly engaged Dussel; the indirect
engagement runs through Apel, who shared Habermas's discourse-ethics
framework but differed in application.

Dussel's concept of "transmodernity" (developed most fully in a 2012
essay and the 1994/1996 works) contests Habermas's defense of modernity
as an "unfinished project": where Habermas diagnoses a pathological
completion of modernity (colonization of the lifeworld by the system),
Dussel argues that modernity itself is constituted by colonial exclusion
from the start. The "Other" — those excluded from the communicative
community — issues a "trans-ontological" or "analeptic" claim from
exteriority; this is not merely a request for inclusion in existing
discourse but a challenge to the ontological framework that generates
the discourse community.

Secondary literature ranges from sympathetic interpretations of Dussel's
critique (Maldonado-Torres, Mendieta) to assessments of the
Apel-Dussel debate (Hurtado Lopez, Zuniga), defenses of Habermas against
decolonial critics (Danner from within Latin American philosophy), and
comparative studies of how the Dussel-Habermas-Apel triangle maps onto
current questions about exclusionary discourse.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is the primary domain for the research project's aim of
situating Dussel's decolonial critique of Habermas within a broader
landscape of exclusion critiques. Dussel provides the most philosophically
systematic decolonial challenge: not only arguing that Habermas's framework
is Eurocentric in application but that its foundational categories
(communicative rationality, the ideal speech situation, the
communication community) are structured to exclude trans-ontological
claims from the colonized "Other."

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The direct Apel-Dussel exchange volume (Apel and Dussel, eds., Etica del
discurso y etica de la liberacion, 2005, Trotta) is not indexed in English-
language academic databases and could not be verified through CrossRef or
S2. The 1996 Humanities Press volume (The Underside of Modernity) is
searchable through S2/OpenAlex but has no CrossRef DOI, so no verified
fields are available from that source. Habermas's own response (if any)
to Dussel has not been found through any search; there is no evidence of
a direct Habermas-Dussel exchange. The Hurtado Lopez Pensamiento article
(2012) returned a false CrossRef match; the OpenAlex record confirms it
exists but DOI was not verified.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, distinguish carefully between: (1) Dussel's direct
critique of Apel/Habermas formal discourse ethics; (2) Dussel's concept
of transmodernity as a challenge to Habermas's "unfinished project of
modernity"; and (3) secondary assessments of the debate's philosophical
stakes. The analeptic/trans-ontological claim of the victim is Dussel's
key innovation against the ideal speech situation.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dussel (Ethics of Liberation, 1997/2013): 7 papers — Critical principle
  of liberation as alternative to formal discourse ethics
- Apel-Dussel dialogue: 3 papers — direct exchange on discourse ethics
  vs. material ethics
- Transmodernity as decolonial alternative to Habermas's modernity: 4
  papers
- Defenders of Habermas against decolonial critique: 1 paper

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel's magnum opus, originally published in Spanish
  in 1998, develops a six-principle architecture for an ethics of
  liberation: the material principle (the reproduction of human life),
  the formal-moral principle (a reformulation of discourse ethics that
  subordinates formal validity to material content), the principle of
  feasibility, the ethical-critical principle (taking the standpoint of
  the victim), the principle of critical validity (the anti-hegemonic
  community of victims), and the liberation principle. The work directly
  engages and critiques Habermas and Apel's discourse ethics, arguing
  that formal communicative rationality presupposes participation in a
  communication community from which victims are structurally excluded.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for understanding Dussel's
  systematic alternative to Habermas. The treatment of discourse ethics
  (especially chapters 2-3) shows precisely how Dussel incorporates but
  subordinates Apel/Habermas's formal principle: the material content of
  life and the claim of the victim are prior to, and normatively superior
  to, the procedural conditions of discourse.

  POSITION: Primary text; the most complete statement of Dussel's critique
  of discourse ethics and his constructive alternative.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel develops his concept of "transmodernity" as a
  project distinct from both postmodernity and the "unfinished project of
  modernity" (Habermas). Modernity, for Dussel, is not simply a European
  achievement marred by incomplete realization but is constituted from the
  start by the colonial exclusion of non-European cultures. Transmodernity
  involves the mutual enrichment of Western and non-Western traditions from
  a position of exteriority rather than inclusion in a universal
  (Eurocentric) project.

  RELEVANCE: This is the key text for understanding how Dussel's concept
  of transmodernity challenges Habermas's defense of modernity as an
  unfinished but viable normative project. The essay shows that the
  decolonial critique is not anti-modern but proposes a genuinely
  pluriversal alternative to Habermas's reformed modernity.

  POSITION: Dussel's mature formulation of transmodernity, contrasting
  it explicitly with Habermasian and postmodern alternatives.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel traces his engagement with the Frankfurt School
  (especially Marcuse and Habermas) and identifies the key point of
  divergence: critical theory's subject remains the European worker or
  the victim of Nazism, while philosophy of liberation begins from the
  excluded Other of the global colonial system. Dussel argues that
  Habermas's lifeworld/system distinction cannot account for the
  "materiality" of colonial suffering — the victims of the global
  world-system since 1492 — which requires a "material" principle prior
  to the formal conditions of communicative action.

  RELEVANCE: This autobiographical and critical essay maps precisely the
  intellectual distance between Dussel and Habermas, making explicit the
  structural reasons why communicative ethics misses colonial exclusion.
  Essential for understanding how Dussel positions himself relative to
  Habermas in the context of the project on exclusion from public reason.

  POSITION: Dussel's own retrospective on the Frankfurt School exchange,
  articulating why his philosophy goes "beyond" critical theory.

  abstract = {After considering the proper tone for my participation in this "dialogue" between Europeans and Latin Americans about "Critical Theory," I have concluded that my argumentative strategy should primarily be to take seriously the "subjects" of the dialogue and their locus enuntiationis: who we are and from where we speak.These sorts of dialogues are not frequent nor are their terms obvious, 1 and it is even less common for such a debate to occur symmetrically, by which I mean that it takes place between philosophers within a community of horizontal communication who are respected as equals, as colleagues, but who nevertheless demand to be recognized in their alterity.Such efforts are not exempt from a certain degree of incommunicability and incommensurability that can create misunderstandings, but are nonetheless united by a solidaristic will to attempt to advance a critical philosophy with global validity.Such a philosophy, which would accordingly set out from the perspective of those excluded from the global system (peripheral countries) and those excluded within particular states (impoverished masses), has not existed to date: I consider its construction the specific task of philosophy in this twenty-first century that we are beginning. The first contacts with the Frankfurt School (with the "first generation")As for myself, I participate in what we have called the "Philosophy of Liberation," 2 which since its origin has maintained a constant dialogue with Critical Theory.Just as the events of Paris '68 did not have the same meaning as those in Berkeley, the Latin American context was equally distinct. 3 Paradoxically, under military dictatorships (imposed by the Pentagon and the Kissinger Doctrine between 1964 and 1984), the works of Marcuse -and especially One-Dimensional Mancame to influence us within a context that was similar to the totalitarian horror under which the first Frankfurt School was born (the "first generation").The "dirty war" which led to the murder, torture, and disappearance of thousands would last almost two decades (as in Brazil, for example). 4 But along with Marcuse, we read the Martinican Frantz Fanon's Les Damnés de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth, 1961), since our reflections were situated in the post-colonial periphery, in the global South.Moreover, our reference point was critical social science -like Dependency Theory, which was later continued by Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory.This global structure of inequality finally burst onto the scene since the Clinton administration under the name of "globalization" (which passed from a period characterized by the internationalization of the productive part of capital -as transnational corporations -to a financial and monetarist era with global implications).The point of all this is the following: our first lesson in Critical Theory was non-Eurocentric.My 1975 work Philosophy of Liberation begins thus:From Heraclitus to Karl von Clausewitz and Kissinger, "war is the origin of everything," if by "everything" one understands the order or system that the world dominators control by their power and armies [...] I am trying, then, to take space, geopolitical space, seriously.To be born at the North Pole or in Chiapas is not the same thing as to be born in New York City. 5 Through the first Frankfurt School, we discovered "materiality" in the sense of living corporeality, a question that does not frequently interest those dealing with the theoretical positions of the School 6 : "Whoever resigns himself to life without any rational reference to self-preservation would, according to the Enlightenment -and Protestantism -regress to prehistory." 7 "Materiality," for the Frankfurt School, consists of an affirmation of living corporality (Leiblichkeit) as in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, which is vulnerable and has desires (Freud), and which needs food, clothing, and shelter (Feuerbach).This anthropological materiality, a far cry from Soviet dialectical materialism, was perceptibly close to our situation in an impoverished, starving, and suffering Latin America.In the Southern Cone, the multitude of demonstrations shouted: "bread, peace, and work!" three necessities that refer strictly to life, to the reproduction of its corporeal content (Leiblichkeit).For that reason, the political-economic sphere had a special relevance for us, as did the need for a frontal critique of capitalism (Marx).Will, affectivity and emotions, unconscious drives, and economic requirements were all integrated into the discourse of the first Frankfurt School.But its subject was a "negative" materiality, focusing especially on the negative effects of the dominant system, its pain and misery.The "positivity" of the system always obscures the "negativity" over which it is constructed: "Hence the convergence of specific materialism with criticism, with social change in practice [...] to abolish suffering.The telos of such an organization or society would be to negate the physical suffering of even the least of its members." 8"Philosophy of Liberation" set out from the locus enuntiationis of the material victim, from the negative effect of authoritarianism, capitalism, and patriarchy.However, this is the root of a profound divergence with Critical Theory that continues up to the present (and which should be an explicit subject of our dialogue), that of the material negativity of colonialism (of the indigenous peoples, the African slave, the Opium Wars in China, etc.), a phenomenon which corresponds to metropolitan capitalism, Modernity, and Eurocentrism.The victim for us was no longer -as for Horkheimer, Habermas, or the "third generation" of Critical Theory -only the worker, the persecuted Jew in Auschwitz, the citizen under Nazism, women, or the working world facing the crisis of the welfare state.We were equally concerned with the victims of a global system (a globalized World-System 9 since 1492), which included the Latin American hacienda system that exploited indigenous people, the mita system of indigenous slave labor which extracted silver (colonial capitalism's first global currency) from mines like that at Potosi in Bolivia, the plantations of African slaves brought to tropical America, the Indian women forced to serve as concubines for the conquistador, the children brought up with Christianity (cultural domination through foreign religion), etc.It was in this context that the ontological category of Totality 10 -so important for Hegel,},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel presents the formal architecture of the ethics of
  liberation in a philosophical context directly engaging Apel and
  Habermas. He argues that the material principle (the reproduction of
  human life) must be foundational rather than derivative of formal
  discourse: the living subject who can participate in discourse is prior
  to any communicative community, and the victim who cannot participate is
  the "starting point" of a critical ethics.

  RELEVANCE: This is Dussel's clearest English-language statement of how
  his ethics both incorporates and transforms the Apel-Habermas framework,
  specifically addressing the discourse ethics tradition in a venue
  (Philosophy and Social Criticism) that also publishes Habermasian work.

First, it clarifies why discourse ethics has difficulties with the grounding and application of moral norms. Second, it turns to a positive appropriation of the formal and proce dural aspects of discourse ethics. The goal is the elaboration of an ethics that is able to incorporate the material aspects of goods and the formal dimension of ethical validity and consensuability. Every morality is the formal application of some substantive good. Every ethical perspective demands its evaluation in terms of its uni versability. In order to achieve this mediation, it is suggested that we must incorporate not only the historical dimension of moral systems, but also the role of critical consciousness and the negativity embod ied by those who are victims of the existing consensus. The essay con cludes with six points that need to be considered when formulating a material ethics that is universalizable and, most importantly, that can address the massive poverty and dehumanization of those excluded from the present community of communication.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited collection assembles essays from leading
  scholars — including Apel himself — on Dussel's philosophy of liberation.
  Apel's contribution ("Can Ethics Be Assimilated under Ethics?") directly
  engages the Apel-Dussel debate, while Schelkshorn's "Discourse and
  Liberation" attempts a critical coordination of discourse ethics and
  liberation ethics. Mignolo, Mendieta, Alcoff, and others assess the
  geopolitical and epistemological stakes of Dussel's thought.

  RELEVANCE: The most important secondary volume on the Dussel-Apel
  exchange in English, making it essential for understanding how Dussel's
  critique of discourse ethics (and by extension Habermas) was received
  by sympathetic and critical interlocutors. Apel's contribution
  constitutes an indirect Habermasian response.

  abstract = {Fichte'sWissenschaftslehreserves an existential as well as a scientific function, and the latter is in the service of the former. So runs a central thesis, and a central theme, of Daniel Breazeale's substantial and long-awaited book on Fichte's early (or 'Jena') philosophical system. That theWissenschaftslehrehas a scientific function is a point that Fichte often trumpets. In one of his preferred formulations, its task is to identify the ground or explanation of the system of representations that are accompanied by a feeling of necessity, and of the feeling of necessity itself. Elsewhere he emphasizes that its task is to identify "die Bestimmung des Menschen" -- the specific determination (or 'vocation') of man. On Breazeale's account, however, these scientific aims are in the service of an existential purpose that is perhaps best described as palliative. TheWissenschaftslehreis Fichte's "means for coming to terms with, and if possible, mitigating, the painful existential division within our own selves" (125).
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That striking formulation of Fichte's ambition was first proposed by Breazeale twenty years ago, in a paper published inFichte-Studien.Fichte-Studien, alas, is not on the shelves of every university library. But this book should be. Breazeale himself is the undisputed dean of Fichte scholarship in the English-speaking world, and among the most important commentators writing on Fichte in any language. Over the past four decades he has not only published scores of papers on Fichte, he has also translated the vast bulk of Fichte's Jena corpus into English, producing a series of masterful critical editions. Both through his own work, and though his influence on the broader scholarly project, he has improved exponentially both the quality and the quantity of primary and secondary material available on Fichte in English. The volume under review comprises fourteen of his papers, all of which were previously published in one form or another. But this is by no means simply a volume of collected essays. Like Fichte himself, Breazeale has not been content to leave his own earlier ideas alone. He has revisited and rethought all of these papers, and the reworking has in most instances led to substantial additions and revisions. The result is a book of great clarity and insight, the mature fruit of long reflection, and one that is really without equivalent in any language.

A memorable passage from the early correspondence provides an instructive glimpse of Fichte's existential project. Writing in the summer of 1795, Fichte was seeking a rapprochement with Jacobi, who would later denounce theWissenschaftslehreas "nihilism." Fichte's letter includes a riff on the Genesis narrative, in a paragraph that concludes with this thought: "Presumption led us to philosophize, and this cost us our innocence. We caught sight of our own nakedness, and since then we have had to philosophize for our salvation." (Breazeale quotes this passage at 137, 263, 379; the mode of composition of the book does result in a certain amount of repetition). So why exactly are we in need of salvation, on Fichte's story, and how could something as obscure and technical as theWissenschaftslehreserve such a function?

Breazeale's answer is framed in terms of "the divided self." Part of the human condition, on this accounting, is to find oneself torn. The division has apsychologicalmanifestation (again and again Breazeale emphasizes the resultingpain), and seems also to have hadbiographicalreality for Fichte himself (drawing on the earliest unpublished "night thoughts," Breazeale argues that Fichte's philosophical work was driven in no small part by personal anguish). But at its root, Breazeale argues, the division is ontological. There is, according to Breazeale's Fichte, "a division at the heart of man's very being as a free, finite agent acting within a spatio-temporal world" (134).

So what is this division, and how can the project of theWissenschaftslehreprovide any kind of help in coping with it? Breazeale characterizes it in a variety of interrelated ways. On one formulation, the division is between "theory and practice," or as Fichte sometimes puts it, between "head and heart." An essential part of human existence is that we both seek knowledge about the world and also act in it. According to Fichte, developing a theme from Kant's antinomies, this dual existence threatens a rupture, specifically with respect to human freedom. From our theoretical perspective, we treat all events, including human actions, as strictly determined; as agents, as Kant's famously puts it, "we act under the idea of freedom." For Fichte, the problem of free will is no mere intellectual puzzle. It puts us at odds with ourselves, with our most developed theoretical reflections threatening to make nonsense of our commitments as agents -- and vice versa. Breazeale: "[Man is] Torn between, on the one hand, the practical certainty of one's own freedom (or moral vocation) and, on the other, the equally undeniable feeling of constraint attendant upon one's empirical awareness of oneself as part and parcel of the natural world-order" (133).

Framed in these terms, one might expect that the "philosophical salvation" about which Fichte writes to Jacobi would take the form of some kind of compatibilism. If your existential suffering derives from the problem of free will, then the philosophy section of your local library is well-stocked with remedies that promise to ease the pain. It is surprising to see how little attention Fichte devotes to this option, particularly since Hume (arguably the grandfather of modern compatibilism) plays such an important role in Fichte's intellectual landscape, as Breazeale shows in his chapters on Aenesidemus (Ch. 2), Maimon (Ch. 3), and skepticism (Ch. 9). Breazeale finds a hint of quasi-rationalist "divine compatibilism" (8) in Fichte's very early book on religion, but the compatibilist theme in Hume's writings seems not to have made any impact on Fichte. Breazeale does at one point describe Fichte's transcendental idealist as "look[ing] for some way to reconcile the experienced passivity of the intellect with the practical certainty of his own freedom or capacity for self-determination" (249). But as we shall see, the reconciliation (such as it is) is highly attenuated, and informed by deeply incompatibilist commitments.

One possible source of those commitments comes into view with a second framing of the existential division: the tug-of-war between autonomy and heteronomy. Sometimes this contrast is framed in Kantian terms as a division between pure moral reason and heteronomous passions. Human nature exhibits "an unstable combination of rationality and sensibility" (345); the result is strife in the human soul. But this familiar and ancient description of the human struggle sits alongside something distinctively modern and idiosyncratically Fichtean. The telltale sign can be found in the particular way in which the drive for autonomy is framed. As Breazeale puts it, the Fichtean I is "predetermined to will independence and self-sufficiencyas the ultimate end of all actingand as the norm for evaluating particular, concrete courses of action" (179, emphasis added). Moreover, the Fichtean conception of self-sufficiency [Selbständigkeit] requires that the I "establish [its] independence and freedom . . .fromany source of external determination" (348, emphasis added).

It is worth pausing to reflect on just how extreme this position really is. The ancient Cynics and Stoics were agreed in placing a very high value on self-sufficiency [αὐτάρκεια], but its value was in large part instrumental. If I am dependent on other things or other people for my happiness, then my happiness is to that extent fragile and vulnerable. Cultivating self-sufficiency is thus a strategy to secure happiness and insure against contingencies that might result in ethical harm. Kant had of course made autonomy a central principle of ethics, but he did not treat autonomy as itself the ultimate end in action. For Kant the ultimate end was thesummum bonum, understood as a combination of happiness and virtue. The Fichtean position on autonomy seems to be much more extreme -- so extreme that it merits a name all its own. Let's call it autono-mania. Autonomy is not simply a value, or an important or central value in human existence; it is the final aim of all action, and requires an absence of determination by anything other than oneself.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Maldonado-Torres situates Dussel's philosophy of
  liberation within the broader "decolonial turn" in Latin American thought,
  tracing how Dussel's analeptic method (moving from the exteriority of

  to questions of colonial exclusion from reason. Essential context for
  understanding why "transmodernity" is not merely cultural pluralism but
  a structural critique of Eurocentric rationality.

  abstract = {Liberation philosophy, as a Latin American project for critical thought, is one among many expressions of a shift in global power dynamics and in epistemic perspective that has taken place since the Second World War.*The European crisis, or more than a crisis, its own internal devastation after the war, opened at least three paths for the train of history and thought.On the one hand, the United States -which had proven itself as an international power through the expansion from the thirteen colonies, the war with Mexico, and the Spanish-American War -became after the Second World War a hegemonic force that would both assist and displace Northwestern Europe as the power-axis of the modern world-system.With this, Americanism -the triumphalist and assimilationist ideology of the United States which had already burst onto the scene with Theodore Roosevelt in the late nineteenth century -was decisively introduced to the rest of the world.This Americanist discourse would dictate the terms for the assimilation of non-Catholic European immigrants, some of which were seen as belonging to darker races. 1 This ideology has taken various turns with McCarthyism and Reagan in the context of the Cold War, and today it takes on a new spirit in formulations like that offered by Samuel P. Huntington, who has forcefully rearticulated Americanism with respect to immigrants and ethnic minorities in the United States. 2 But today, after the Cold War and the attacks of 11 September, it is no longer European immigrants that allegedly pose a "challenge" to U.S.-American identity, but rather Latin American (im)migrants, particularly Spanish-speaking Mexicans and Chicana/os. 3 There is, accordingly, a particular importance today for exploring the decolonial potential of those cultural forms originating in Latin America, Mexico, and in the borderlands between Mexico and the United States, among other "frontier" territories both to the north and south of this border. 4e second path that opened with the decline of Europe was, clearly, that of the Cold War rival of Americanism: Soviet communism.Soviet communism, or at least socialism (which is a different but related political system/ideology), would become for many a viable option for a different future, beyond both fascist and liberal Europe.Europe itself would come to be divided between these two newly regnant ideologies and neo-imperial geo-political projects.Other regions also suffered the force of this clash of political projects, while many nations tried to find a space between or in alliance with the two dominant blocs.Now, the decline of Europe opened a third path, which we will call -following Frantz Fanon -that of the "wretched of the earth," as well as the "de-colonial turn." 5 This door would be definitively forced open through the combination of the internal and external devastation of Europe, that is to say, not only by the perverse force of Nazism in its interior but also by the encouraging force of the decolonization of European territories abroad.In contrast to the Latin American liberation struggles of the nineteenth century, which took place in a context in which the weakening of Southern Europe left intact the fascination with the increasing strength of Northern Europe (especially France and England), mid-twentieth century Europe was destroyed by Nazism and completely demoralized.As the},

  abstract = {Enrique Dussel is Latin America’s foremost philosopher, renowned for his contributions to ethics, political philosophy, and liberation theology. Designed for classroom use, this collection of essays engages with Dussel’s encyclopedic work, making his valuable contributions accessible to English-speaking students. In addition to being one of the most original, prolific, and widely known members of the Latin American Philosophy of Liberation movement, Dussel has also made important contributions to world philosophy, the history of philosophy, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and the understanding of Karl Marx. Dussel famously engaged in a decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel on the relationship between material and formal ethics—that is, between an ethics of the community of life and an ethics of the community of discourse—and he has produced novel interpretations and analyses of the concepts of alterity, exteriority, the other, and the world history of ethical systems. Most recently, Dussel extended his work on an ethics of liberation into a politics of liberation, developed over the course of three published volumes. In this book, scholars from around the world assess Dussel’s work in ways that are both appreciative and critical. Two essays by Dussel bookend the volume: the collection opens with a consideration of the (im)possibility of multiple modernities and ends with an autobiographical trajectory of the philosopher’s thinking.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel (with management scholar Ibarra-Colado) applies
  the ethics of liberation to organizational theory, arguing that
  Habermas's ideal of communicative rationality within organizations
  presupposes a symmetric communicative situation that does not exist in
  globalized capitalism. The article introduces key concepts — the "victim"
  of the economic system, "exteriority," and the "analeptic" move — to
  critique Habermasian communicative ethics in organizational contexts.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how Dussel's critique of Habermas extends from ethics
  into political economy and organization theory, making the exclusion
  argument concrete: the asymmetric position of peripheral/excluded
  workers in globalized capitalism means they cannot participate in
  idealized communicative rationality.

  abstract = {The paper discusses three related issues that have a growing importance in the light of current developments in the contemporary debates around modernity and its future. These are globalization, organization and the ethics of liberation. The first section recognizes the specific meaning of globalization when it is confronted with the prevailing Eurocentrism. The result should be a critical posture that understands the world as a system that goes far beyond Europe. The second section discusses the nature of the problems of organization related to globalization. The organization of human activities related to production and commerce required a permanent process of ‘simplification’. This was achieved by means of the ‘rationalization’ of the world of life in all its economic, political, cultural and religious subsystems. One of its undeniable consequences has been the production of victims and exclusion, proving the asymmetrical organization of ‘modern’ life. The final section, centred in the ethics of liberation, will allow us to clarify the elements and determinants for the transformation of this modern condition to guarantee the production, reproduction and development of life. A new type of theoretical possibility emerges to think of the world as a trans-modern organization of life characterized by its plurality, diversity and reasonability.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mills provides a systematic introduction to Dussel's ethics
  of liberation, covering all six principles of the architectonic, the
  analeptic method, the role of the victim, and Dussel's engagements with

  note      = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Danner argues that both Habermas and Weber suffer from
  a "historical-sociological blindness": they reconstruct European modernity
  as an endogenous process without acknowledging its constitutive relation
  to colonialism. Contra Habermas, who defends modernity's normative
  paradigm as viable if reformed, Danner argues that the decolonial
  critique demands the "self-restraint of modernity" and an anti-colonial
  politics of reparation as the condition for any genuine universalism.
  The essay engages Dussel's analysis as well as Mignolo's coloniality
  framework.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a direct philosophical comparison of Habermas's
  defense of modernity with the Latin American decolonial critique,
  articulating precisely what is at stake when Dussel accuses Habermas
  of Eurocentric blindness. Shows a position between full acceptance of
  Habermasian reform and Dussel's transmodern alternative.

  POSITION: Latin American philosophical critique that works through the
  Habermas-Dussel contrast and argues for a decolonial corrective beyond
  Habermas.

  abstract = {The paper argues on the Latin-American philosophy as a decolonial praxis which unveils and overcomes the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity (such as Max Weber and Jürgen Habermas). This historical-sociological blindness is characterized (a) by the separation between European culture and the modern Realpolitik of the colonialism as non-dependent and non-mutually-supported moments, and (b) by the reconstruction of the process of constitution of the European modernity as an endogenous, self-referential and basically internal movement of evolution, ignoring again its correlation and profound linking with colonialism. The paper argues that the critical and emancipatory role of the modernity’s normative paradigm only is possible by that historical-sociological blindness. So, the Latin-American philosophy, the moment it denounces and unveils the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity, points directly to the self-restraint of the modernity’s normative paradigm as the basic theoretical-political agenda and praxis for a decolonial philosophy, as condition also to the correction of the modernity itself. Contrarily to Habermas, who defends the renewal of the modernity’s normative paradigm as a non-fundamentalist epistemological-moral universalism, the decolonial philosophy will show that the historical-sociological blindness only can be resolved from the self-restraint of the modernity and from an anti-colonial politics based on the reparation for colonialism as a critical-normative concept for theoretical analysis and political praxis regarding modernity-modernization as a totalizing epistemological-cultural-societal movement towards colonialism.    },

  CORE ARGUMENT: Grosfoguel uses Dussel's concept of transmodernity (along
  with Quijano's coloniality of power and Mignolo's border thinking) to
  critique both postcolonial studies and Marxist political economy for
  their failure to break with Eurocentric epistemology. He argues that
  transmodernity — the affirmation of the exteriority of non-Western
  traditions — is the appropriate decolonial alternative to Habermas's
  reformed modernity and Wallerstein's world-systems analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Provides intellectual context for Dussel's transmodernity
  within the broader decolonial/coloniality tradition (Quijano, Mignolo,
  Grosfoguel), showing that the critique of Habermas's modernity-defense
  is part of a wider movement. Establishes the theoretical neighborhood
  within which Dussel's Habermas critique operates.

  situates Habermas as exemplary of the Eurocentric modernism that

  CORE ARGUMENT: The article traces how Dussel's concept of transmodernity

  the best of modernity's rational character while reversing its colonial
  domination via the analeptic affirmation of cultural exteriority. The
  article also examines how Castro-Gomez appropriates transmodernity for
  a "transmodern republicanism" that differs from Dussel's liberation
  perspective.

  RELEVANCE: Helpful for clarifying what exactly Dussel means by
  "transmodernity" as a political and philosophical concept — particularly
  its distinctive claim to go beyond (rather than reject) modernity, which
  is what makes Dussel's position different from simple anti-modernism.

  reformed modernity.

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures —ana- lectic—. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity —its rational character—, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-Gómez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: The article directly compares Dussel's and Habermas's

  for the third world: Habermas's universalism is "attached to the old
  world" and cannot meet the emancipation needs of peripheral peoples.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a direct philosophical comparison of the two thinkers
  in the context of Latin American critical theory. Shows the tension
  between Habermas's procedural universalism and Dussel's material ethics

  abstract = {The goal of the present paper is to establish a parallel between the ethical perspectives presented by Dussel and Habermas and, from these assumptions, to argue if the universal consensus meets the citizenship demands of the Latin American man. On the one hand, Dussel starts from a responsible exegesis of Marxian writings which, purged in the light of third world demands, leads to the idea of praxis as the path to man's self-liberation. It is, in fact, a loosening of the Europeanist aspect of the critique of the nineteen hundred, in order to create, through social work, the disalienation. On the other hand, although Habermas shows some sensitivity to the problem of man excluded by capital relations, his universalism is attached to the old world. It is therefore necessary to ask whether this whole theoretical building is sufficient to meet the emancipation needs of the third world man. Such an analysis leads us, certainly, to the concept of utopia, so dear to Dussel, thematized as a space yet to happen, as a possibility for the realization of man. Aspect that for Habermas is linked to the future as a construction of democracy.},

  abstract = {It has been more than 15 years since the philosopher Enrique Dussel published Ethics of Liberation in the Age of Globalization and Exclusion in Spanish; its recent publication in English points to how it has become a touchstone for contemporary critical thinking. The importance of this work lies, on the one hand, in how it demonstrates the force of philosophical thought that reproduces itself in the periphery of the world-system and, on the other hand, in how it poses theoretical, ethical, and political questions radically important for humanity in this third millennium. In this sense, the book questions the hegemonic ethics that postulates the “save who you can” ideology of capitalism and even justifies social Darwinism.We have before us a work that from the introduction confronts the hegemonic vision of history — in Walter Benjamin's sense of the term — as not part of the Hellenic world but of North Africa and the Middle East, relativizing the role of Europe in the formation of a global culture. One should note that this historical description has the “philosophical intent” of calling into question the myth of modernity, the ideology of progress, and alleged Western superiority (p. 1).In the first part, “Foundation of Ethics,” the author states the three primary principles (or moments) that configure the architectural framework of the book. First is the “material principle,” which touches upon “suffering corporeality” derived from the victim's negative experiences (p. 284). Second is the “formal principle of morality” (p. 141), which refers to the application of the truth/validity norm and furthermore most valuably reformulates the “discourse ethics” proposed by Karl-Otto Apel (p. 121); this principle maintains a fruitful dialogue with and complements the material principle. Last is the “principle of feasibility,” which focuses upon context or environment, consequently weighing what is factually possible. With this principle, the instrumental role of reason is properly placed by precisely subsuming it to a single objective: the production, reproduction, and development of human life in community. Yet the author mentions that no perfect system or institution exists, maintaining that every system always produces an unintentional negative effect.In the second part, “Critical Ethics, Antihegemonic Validity, and the Praxis of Liberation,” the author lays out the other three principles that configure the ethics of liberation. First is the “ethical-critical principle,” a structurally central component and part of the negativity of the victims. Following the reflections of Karl Marx, critical theory, and Emmanuel Levinas, Dussel postulates the creation of a new ethical system based upon a universal rationality of liberation that has as a reference point the alterity and exteriority of the victim. Second, the “principle of validity” addresses the necessity and possibility of a situation of intersubjective consensus to conform to this new ethics. Following the thinking of Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, the author rehabilitates the role of utopia in ethical and social projects. The last principle, the “liberation principle,” is the moment when the victims raise themselves to a radical transformation of the system, or, in other words, when they leave the situation of material negativity in which they find themselves. In this regard, the author addresses a prickly subject for contemporary political philosophy: violence. While the author suggests that we are not naive to advocate violence, he notes that it exists as an unavoidable resource with which you always have victims. The author also retakes the most valuable aspect of Marxist philosophical thought by approaching the question of the constitution of subjects, of historical actors who, in their praxis, envision building a just, free, and democratic society.Finally, the validity and coherence of the ethical material proposed by the author reveal themselves obviously, since it takes as its starting point the pain of the bodily reality of the victims in order to rebuke the destructive logic of this “actually existing modernity.” In this sense, I maintain that Ethics of Liberation marks an important point not only in the trajectory of this Argentine philosopher but also in the development of the history of contemporary thought. For this, I consider the publication and diffusion of this monumental work in the English-speaking world important.},

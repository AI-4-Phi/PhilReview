## Conclusion

The foregoing review has traced a multi-stranded body of critique unified by a convergent structural diagnosis: that Habermasian communicative rationality and the normative account of the bourgeois public sphere do not merely fail to include marginalized groups but encode the social position of a normatively particular subject — rational, able-bodied, bourgeois, male, and European — as the unmarked baseline of communicative competence. Feminist critiques established the paradigmatic vocabulary (counter-publics, interactive universalism, communicative democracy) and identified exclusion at the procedural level. Race-critical and disability-theoretic critiques deepened the diagnosis: not merely procedural disadvantage but the ontological foreclosure of the conditions under which subjects can present themselves as valid speakers at all. The decolonial tradition pressed the argument to the foundational level, charging that the normative resources of modernity — communicative rationality, the public sphere, the ideal of rational learning — are themselves constituted through the colonial exclusions they cannot acknowledge without self-undermining (Allen 2016; Bhambra 2021). Each descent to a deeper level of critique has required a correspondingly more radical response: from procedural supplement, to epistemic reconstruction, to foundational replacement.

Dussel's transmodern critique occupies the most philosophically radical position within this landscape. His argument is not that Habermasian discourse ethics reaches wrong conclusions but that its formal architecture already presupposes what the modern world-system has structurally denied: membership in the communication community. The material principle — the reproduction of human life as the content of moral obligation — is prior to, and the condition of, the formal discourse principle; victims of the global system issue their claims from an exteriority that the communication community's internal logic cannot register (Dussel 2012). Three features mark this position as distinctive rather than merely more extreme. First, it engages the formal architecture of Apel's and, by extension, Habermas's discourse ethics at the level of architectonic design, not only application. Second, the concept of exteriority — drawn from Levinas's ethics of alterity but transformed from phenomenological encounter into the structured exclusion of colonial modernity — names a position that cannot be accommodated within any counter-public logic, because counter-publics remain within the ontological framework that exteriority contests. Third, the grounding is ethical-material rather than epistemological or identitarian: it is the living, suffering body of the victim, not epistemic standpoints or identity positions, that constitutes the starting point of critical ethics.

The reconstructivist responses have grown in sophistication in direct proportion to the pressure the exclusion critiques have applied. Bohman's epistemic diversity arguments, Benhabib's multicultural extension of discourse ethics, and Mendonça and Asenbaum's (2025) six-move decolonizing framework represent genuine philosophical advances, each addressing a different level of the exclusion critique while remaining committed to the universality of communicative competence as the normative baseline. The decolonial challenge's force depends on whether Habermas's formal-pragmatic distinction between communicative competence and lifeworld contents is sustainable — whether there is a level at which communicative rationality is universal rather than Eurocentric. Quijano's (2000) coloniality of power argument denies this: the attribution of communicative competence is not free from the colonial classifications that determine who counts as a rational agent. Consani (2023) defends the distinction from the other side, arguing that abandoning rationality as a normative criterion — as Allen's critique tends to require — undermines the normative ground on which any critique of domination must stand. This exchange is not yet resolved, and its resolution is what would settle the question of whether immanent repair or structural replacement is philosophically required.

Four unresolved tensions define the productive research frontier the present project enters. The first is the debate between immanent repair and structural replacement itself: whether any reconstruction of Habermasian universalism can survive the decolonial challenge, or whether the critique is structural enough to require foundational alternatives. The second is Allen's (2016) question about progress-teleology: whether a decolonized critical theory must abandon the developmental normativity that gives Habermasian critique its normative traction, and what — if anything — can do the same work without encoding a Eurocentric hierarchy of development. The third, and most directly bearing on the research project ahead, is whether Dussel's material principle — human life as the foundational content of moral obligation — constitutes a viable normative foundation that is neither relativist nor Eurocentric, and whether this foundation can sustain the kind of cross-cultural critical universalism that decolonial ethics requires. The fourth is whether feminist and decolonial critiques can be brought into a productive joint framework or whether their divergences — about embodiment, epistemology, standpoint, and the subject of liberation — reflect deeper incompatibilities. Torres (2025) documents that the Frankfurt School is now conducting this reckoning institutionally; whether it can do so philosophically, without abandoning the emancipatory project, is what the current state of the debate leaves open.

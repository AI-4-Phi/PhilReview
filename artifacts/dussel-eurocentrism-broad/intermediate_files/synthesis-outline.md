## Overarching Argumentative Threads

Three threads run across all sections and should be woven into the review rather than treated as topics in isolation:

1. **The totality/exteriority dialectic**: Dussel consistently diagnoses Eurocentrism as the philosophical operation by which a particular perspective (European modernity) posits itself as the totality of reason, thereby rendering invisible those who stand outside it. The victim, the colonized, the poor appeal from an "exteriority" that dominant philosophy cannot see. This thread connects his myth of modernity thesis, his ethics of liberation, his epistemology, and his political philosophy.

2. **The performative tension in Dussel's own project**: A persistent challenge across critics (Vargas, Chambers, Irvine, Vizcaino, Maldonado-Torres on Levinas) is that Dussel critiques Eurocentrism using European philosophical tools (Levinas, Marx, Hegel, discourse ethics). Whether this represents a productive appropriation or a self-undermining contradiction is unresolved in the literature. The review should track this tension rather than resolve it.

3. **Universalism without Eurocentrism**: Dussel insists that critiquing Eurocentric universalism does not entail relativism. His proposals for "analogical universality," "pluriversality," and "transmodernity" all attempt to articulate a genuinely universal standpoint grounded in intercultural dialogue and the material principle of life. Whether this project succeeds is the deepest philosophical question the review addresses.

## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism, define the concept's scope and function across his philosophy, and preview the review's thematic structure.

**Content**:
- Dussel as a major figure in Latin American philosophy of liberation, and his distinctive positioning: thinking from the "underside" of European modernity, from the experience of 1492 and colonial violence
- Brief characterization of what "Eurocentrism" means in Dussel: not a bias to be corrected but a structural feature of how European modernity constitutes itself — as center, as universal, as the telos of world history
- Note that Dussel's critique is simultaneously historical (modernity's origin in 1492, not the Renaissance), ethical (European ethics presupposes inclusion rather than victims), epistemological (knowledge is geopolitically situated), and political (liberal democracy as Eurocentric institution)
- Preview the five thematic sections; note that they organize debates across domains, not domain-by-domain summaries
- Acknowledge scope: review prioritizes Spanish-language secondary literature, engages both sympathetic and critical positions, and identifies unresolved tensions

**Key Papers**: Pimenta 2025 (intellectual reconstruction of Dussel's concept of modernity); Gracia 2000 (SEP entry, intellectual-historical context); Maldonado-Torres 2011 (Dussel in the decolonial turn); Grosfoguel 2011 (modernity/coloniality program); AlcoffMendieta 2000 (foundational English-language collection)

**Word Target**: 350-450 words

## Section 1: Modernity, 1492, and the Structure of the Myth

**Section Purpose**: Establish Dussel's foundational thesis — that Eurocentrism is not a contingent bias but is structurally embedded in how modernity narrates its own origin — and map the main debates over his periodization, his critique of European theorists of modernity, and his historiographical method.

**Key Debate/Tension**: Dussel argues that modernity originates in 1492, not in intra-European events (Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment). This is not merely a historical claim but a philosophical one: the colonial encounter simultaneously produces Europe's self-image as "modern" and enacts sacrificial violence on colonized peoples. The "myth of modernity" is the narrative by which this violence is justified as a necessary cost of progress. The tension in secondary literature is whether this thesis offers a genuinely new historiography or overstates the rupture of 1492 at the expense of more complex accounts of modernity.

**Subsection 1.1: The 1492 Periodization and the "Myth"**

**Papers**: Camelo 2018, AyalaColqui 2019, Pimenta 2025
**Content**: Exposition of Dussel's claim that 1492 is the origin of "Modernity as concept" — the moment when European self-understanding is constituted through the covering-up (encubrimiento) of the non-European Other. The myth operates not as falsehood but as a justification: colonial violence is presented as the civilizing burden necessary for modernity's emancipatory project. Show how Dussel's critique of the "developmental fallacy" targets the assumption that non-European societies are merely "underdeveloped" rather than alternative life-forms.
**Connection**: This establishes why Eurocentrism is structural, not accidental: it is built into the self-narration of modernity as emancipatory and universal.

**Subsection 1.2: Dussel's Critique of European Theorists of Modernity**

**Papers**: Dallmayr 2004, Orrego 2025, Ramaglia 2019
**Content**: Dussel's critique of Habermas (for accepting the intra-European origins of modernity), Hegel (for reading world history as culminating in Europe), and Adorno/Heidegger (for diagnosing modernity's dialectic without seeing the colonial underside). Show how Dallmayr attempts to mediate between Dussel and Frankfurt School critical theory. Note Ramaglia's comparison of Dussel and Echeverria as two distinct Latin American critical strategies.
**Connection**: Establishes what Dussel argues is missing in European self-critique: the perspective from the colonial periphery.

**Subsection 1.3: Transmodernity as Alternative**

**Papers**: Deere 2025, LozanoSuarez 2021, Grosfoguel 2011, Dussel 2025
**Content**: Dussel's constructive proposal: transmodernity does not reject modernity but proposes a pluriversal alternative in which the suppressed cultural resources of colonized peoples enter into dialogue with modernity's rational achievements. Distinguish transmodernity from postmodernity (internal European critique) and from cultural nativism. Note how Grosfoguel integrates Dussel's transmodernity into the broader modernity/coloniality research program.
**Connection**: Sets up the universalism-particularity debate that runs through the rest of the review.

**Section Summary**: Dussel's myth of modernity thesis offers a distinctive diagnosis of Eurocentrism as constitutive of modernity's self-image. Secondary literature broadly accepts the framing but debates the adequacy of the historiography and whether transmodernity succeeds as an alternative.

**Word Target**: 550-700 words

## Section 2: Exteriority, the Victim, and the Ethics of Liberation

**Section Purpose**: Examine how Dussel's ethics of liberation diagnoses and responds to Eurocentrism in moral philosophy — through the concepts of exteriority, the material principle of life, and the victim — and assess the Dussel-Apel debate as the central controversy over material versus formal ethics.

**Key Debate/Tension**: Dussel argues that Kantian and discourse-ethical frameworks are Eurocentric not because they have European authors but because they presuppose an ideal community of communication from which victims are excluded. His material principle — the obligation to produce, reproduce, and develop human life — grounds ethical critique in corporeal vulnerability rather than abstract consensus. The debate with Apel turns on whether ethics must begin from participants within discourse or from those excluded from it.

**Subsection 2.1: Levinas Transformed — Exteriority as Material-Historical Category**

**Papers**: Barber 1998, Barber 2020, Beach 2004, MaldonadoTorres 2011
**Content**: Dussel appropriates Levinas's concept of the "face" and the ethical demand of the Other, but transforms it from a transhistorical phenomenological category into a material-historical one: the Other is the colonized, the poor, the victim of globalization. Beach's article on Dussel's challenge to Levinas is essential here — Dussel historicizes Levinas by grounding the Other in specific colonial structures. Note that this transformation is also contested: Maldonado-Torres argues Dussel should have been more Fanonian than Levinasian, and Vargas identifies the Levinas reliance as an instance of the "Eurocentrism Problem."
**Connection**: Introduces the performative tension thread.

**Subsection 2.2: The Material Principle and the Dussel-Apel Debate**

**Papers**: Dussel 1997, Apel 2000, Zuniga 2021, Sorensen 2010, HurtadoLopez 2012
**Content**: Dussel's architectonic of ethics: material principle (life-reproduction), formal principle (discourse validity), feasibility principle (strategic-institutional). His claim is that material ethics has priority because discourse presupposes participants whose life has already been affirmed — victims cannot enter discourse as equals. Apel's defense: discourse ethics already contains resources for addressing excluded victims; liberation ethics cannot ground universal norms without presupposing communicative rationality. Sorensen's critique: Dussel's ethics may reproduce the ideological universalization it diagnoses. Zuniga's defense: corporeal vulnerability is genuinely universal, providing non-Eurocentric grounding for the material principle.
**Connection**: Central to the universalism-without-Eurocentrism thread.

**Subsection 2.3: The Victim as Epistemological-Ethical Standpoint**

**Papers**: Knauss 2013, DiazFernandez 2022, AllenMendieta 2021
**Content**: Dussel's argument that victims have epistemological privilege — they know that the system denies life in ways that participants cannot know. This is the ethical-epistemological link between his critique of Eurocentric ethics and his broader epistemology. Allen's essay in the 2021 volume examines whether Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism inadvertently relies on Eurocentric categories of development. Diaz Fernandez provides a critical secular reading from within Latin American philosophy, noting tensions in the ethics-politics transition and the Cerutti critique (Dussel's early populism).
**Connection**: Prepares the epistemology section.

**Section Summary**: Dussel's ethics of liberation constitutes his most systematic critique of Eurocentrism in philosophy. The debate with Apel remains unresolved: sympathetic readers (Zuniga) defend the material principle's universality; critical readers (Sorensen, Quintana Paz) identify internal tensions; feminists (Lange, Vuola) argue for additional correctives.

**Word Target**: 600-750 words

## Section 3: Epistemology, Geopolitics of Knowledge, and the Eurocentrism Problem

**Section Purpose**: Examine Dussel's epistemological critique of Eurocentrism — the claim that knowledge production is geopolitically situated and that "Western epistemology" masks European particularity as universal reason — and assess the major objections to this project.

**Key Debate/Tension**: Can a critique of Eurocentrism in epistemology be coherent when it uses European conceptual tools? Vargas's "Eurocentrism Problem" and Chambers's charge of self-undermining relativism represent the strongest external objections. Timmenga, Retamozo, and Barber defend Dussel's epistemology as neither relativist nor surreptitiously Eurocentric. This debate is the most philosophically acute in the secondary literature.

**Subsection 3.1: The Geopolitics of Knowledge**

**Papers**: Retamozo 2017, Alcoff 2000, Hoagland 2020, Stone-Mediatore 2023
**Content**: Dussel's claim that knowledge is always geopolitically situated — the "ego cogito" of Descartes presupposes the "ego conquiro" of colonial conquest. Retamozo's systematic treatment (in Spanish) of how this translates into social science methodology: objectivity, demarcation, and the logic of research must all be rethought from the standpoint of liberation philosophy. Stone-Mediatore applies the geopolitics of knowledge critique to global ethics pedagogy — a concrete case study showing how seemingly progressive frameworks reproduce colonial power. Alcoff's dialogue between Dussel and Foucault clarifies what the geopolitics of knowledge adds beyond Foucauldian genealogy.
**Connection**: Grounds the epistemological dimension of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique empirically.

**Subsection 3.2: The Eurocentrism Problem — Does Dussel Escape It?**

**Papers**: Vargas 2005, Chambers 2020, Irvine 2010/2011, Vizcaino 2021, Timmenga 2025
**Content**: Vargas's formulation of the problem: liberation philosophy relies on Levinas, Hegel, Marx, and discourse ethics despite condemning European conceptual frameworks. Chambers extends this into a systematic charge of relativism: decolonial epistemology (Dussel, Quijano, Mignolo) misreads Enlightenment figures and ultimately cannot ground the social science it needs. Irvine's analytic challenge to Dussel's "trans-ontology": does analectics genuinely transcend Western ontology? Vizcaino's internal critique: Dussel's use of "anti-fetishism" (from Marx) smuggles in Eurocentric categories. Timmenga et al. defend Dussel as a "relational thinker" whose universalism is context-sensitive rather than abstractly Eurocentric. Note that Vargas's challenge has not been adequately answered in the literature.
**Connection**: This is the section most directly critical of Dussel; essential for the review's balance.

**Subsection 3.3: Feminist Corrections to Decolonial Epistemology**

**Papers**: Mendoza and Grijalva 2022, Lange 1998/2000, Schutte 1993
**Content**: Mendoza and Grijalva argue that Dussel's epistemology neglects Latin American feminist scholarship while citing Chicana theory — a form of epistemological colonialism within the decolonial project. Lange's feminist reading of Dussel's construction of indigenous peoples as passive victims rather than active agents. Schutte's earlier critique of liberation philosophy's masculinism. Together, these show that Dussel's account of exteriority is incomplete: gender, sexuality, and racialized femininity are not adequately theorized as axes of colonial exclusion.
**Connection**: Demonstrates the internal limits of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique.

**Section Summary**: Dussel's epistemological critique of Eurocentrism is the most contested area of his philosophy. The objections are serious: Chambers's relativism charge, Vargas's performative contradiction, Vizcaino's internal critique, and feminist challenges to the gendering of exteriority. Defenders (Timmenga, Retamozo, Barber) argue that Dussel's analectics successfully navigates between dogmatism and skepticism. The debate is unresolved.

**Word Target**: 600-700 words

## Section 4: Political Power, Fetishism, and the Decolonial Alternative

**Section Purpose**: Examine how Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism extends to political philosophy — his diagnosis of liberal democracy and social contract theory as Eurocentric, his potentia/potestas distinction, and his concept of the fetishization of power — and assess debates about transmodernity as a political project.

**Key Debate/Tension**: Dussel argues that liberal democratic theory is Eurocentric not only in its origins but in its structure: it begins from constituted power (the state, representative institutions) rather than from the constituent power of the people (potentia). When institutions sever their connection to popular will, power becomes fetishized. The debate in secondary literature concerns whether Dussel's populist framework is viable or whether, as Castro-Gómez argues, it requires revision in the direction of republican democracy.

**Subsection 4.1: Potentia, Potestas, and the Fetishism of Power**

**Papers**: HerreraTorres 2016, GomezCarbajal 2018, Padilla 2023, Rizzo 2025
**Content**: Dussel's fundamental political distinction: potentia (the will-to-live of the community, what he calls "hyperpotentia" or "poder popular") versus potestas (institutionalized power that can become fetishized). HerreraTorres provides the most systematic Spanish-language exposition of this distinction. GomezCarbajal traces the passage from Marx's critique of commodity fetishism to Dussel's critique of power fetishism — the conceptual continuity between Dussel's reading of Marx and his political philosophy. Padilla and Rizzo address the theological dimension: Dussel's political theology critiques Eurocentric political theology (Schmitt, Agamben) by centering liberation rather than sovereignty.
**Connection**: Extends the totality/exteriority dialectic into political ontology.

**Subsection 4.2: Transmodernity as Political Project — Internal Debates**

**Papers**: Camelo 2024, LozanoSuarez 2021, DiazFernandez 2022, Achenbach 2021
**Content**: The most productive internal debate in the literature: Castro-Gómez argues that Dussel's populist politics of liberation is inadequate because it lacks republican institutional resources — it theorizes the "people" as a unified anti-fetishist force but cannot account for institutional complexity and democratic disagreement. Camelo shows that transmodernity is the convergent point between Dussel and Castro-Gómez despite their disagreement on populism and democracy. Achenbach examines the Ricoeur-Dussel exchange on universality and world-historical agency. DiazFernandez provides the secular critical reading connecting the Castro-Gómez and Apel critiques.
**Connection**: Shows that Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism generates internal disagreements within decolonial political thought.

**Subsection 4.3: Comparative Dialogues with European Political Philosophy**

**Papers**: SagerSpencer 2016, Reynolds 2014, CoronadoPreciado 2018
**Content**: Dussel in dialogue with Dewey pragmatism (Sager and Spencer: both emphasize marginalized perspectives and democratic inquiry, but Dewey's fallibilism vs. Dussel's phenomenological starting point). Reynolds compares Dussel to Rorty on utopian politics — liberal ironism vs. philosophy of liberation. CoronadoPreciado's overview of Dussel's politics as counter-hegemonic field emphasizing Las Casas/Vitoria heritage. These dialogues help assess whether Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism in politics has constructive alternatives or remains primarily diagnostic.
**Connection**: Tests the transmodernity thread against concrete alternative political frameworks.

**Section Summary**: Dussel's political philosophy extends the Eurocentrism critique into institutional analysis. The potentia/potestas distinction is his most original political contribution; the internal debate with Castro-Gómez is the most productive critical engagement. The question of whether Dussel's politics of liberation can account for institutional complexity without collapsing into populism is unresolved.

**Word Target**: 550-650 words

## Section 5: The Limits of Liberation — Feminist, Internal, and Philosophical Critiques

**Purpose**: This section is not a separate thematic area but an organizing frame for critiques that run across sections 1-4. It synthesizes the main objections to Dussel's account of Eurocentrism as a whole, giving the review its necessary critical balance.

**Note to Synthesis Writer**: Many of the critical papers appear in earlier sections. This section should not repeat what is covered there. Instead, synthesize: are there patterns across critiques? Do critics ultimately call for revising Dussel's framework or abandoning it? What does the pattern of objections reveal about the underlying tensions in his project?

**Content**:

- **The performative contradiction (Vargas, Chambers, Irvine)**: The strongest philosophical objection is that Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism is self-undermining. Vargas's Eurocentrism Problem has not been adequately answered in the literature. Chambers extends the charge to the entire decolonial epistemological project. Whether Timmenga's defense of Dussel's "relational universalism" resolves or merely reframes this objection.

- **Feminist limits (Lange, Vuola, Mendoza-Grijalva, Schutte)**: Feminist critics across decades have made a consistent point: Dussel's account of the excluded Other privileges class and colonial position but undertheorizes gender, sexuality, and the intersection of racial and sexual domination. The "victim" in Dussel's ethics tends to be figured implicitly as male. This is not merely an oversight but a structural gap — Dussel's concept of "exteriority" needs to reckon with how gender functions as a constitutive axis of colonial exclusion.

- **Internal decolonial tensions (Castro-Gómez, Cerutti)**: From within liberation philosophy and decolonial theory, critiques focus on Dussel's populism (Castro-Gómez) and early problematic moves (Cerutti's critique of the pre-1977 Dussel). These show that the decolonial project is internally contested, not a unified program.

- **What the critiques converge on**: Dussel's framework is most powerful as a diagnostic tool (identifying how Eurocentrism operates structurally) and less developed as a constructive program (transmodernity and pluriversality remain somewhat programmatic). The best critiques reveal this asymmetry.

**Key Papers**: Vargas 2005, Chambers 2020, Lange 1998, Mendoza and Grijalva 2022, Camelo 2024, DiazFernandez 2022, Timmenga 2025

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize Dussel's account of Eurocentrism across its philosophical dimensions and identify unresolved questions that map future research directions.

**Content**:
- Dussel's account of Eurocentrism is not reducible to any one domain: it is a comprehensive diagnosis of how European modernity constitutes itself as universal by suppressing the perspective of the colonized. The totality/exteriority dialectic unifies his historical, ethical, epistemological, and political critiques.
- The material principle of life and the figure of the victim provide a non-relativist standpoint for critique that is grounded in corporeal vulnerability rather than abstract reason — this is Dussel's most distinctive philosophical contribution.
- The most serious unresolved question is the performative tension: Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism deploys European tools (Levinas, Marx, discourse ethics) in ways that critics have not found adequately justified. Whether this represents a productive appropriation or a self-undermining dependence remains contested.
- Feminist and intersectional critiques have identified a genuine gap: Dussel's account of exteriority undertheorizes gender as a constitutive axis of colonial exclusion.
- Transmodernity as a political-philosophical program is ambitious but remains underdeveloped in secondary literature relative to the diagnostic critique.
- Research would benefit from: systematic comparison of Dussel's account of Eurocentrism with African and Asian decolonial thinkers (beyond Fanon); more sustained engagement with the feminist correctives; analytic-philosophical assessment of whether the material principle of life grounds the universalist claims Dussel needs it to bear.

**Word Target**: 350-450 words

        "Modernity is not in this case a merely intra-European phenomenon that belongs to a periodization of history enunciated from the West. It is, on the contrary, a moment that arose from the experience of colonization of the non-European Other. As Dussel argues, 1492 will be the moment of the \u2018birth\u2019 of Modernity as a concept, the concrete moment of the \u2018origin\u2019 of a very particular \u2018myth\u2019 of sacrificial violence and, at the same time, a process of \u2018covering up\u2019 of the non-European.",
        "Understanding the context of the emergence of this colonizing experience, that is to say, of the other worlds of life before and outside of this European Modernity, is the objective of this fifth section. For this, four moments are addressed in the text: China, the Ottoman Empire, pre-modern and eastern Venice, the Italian Renaissance."

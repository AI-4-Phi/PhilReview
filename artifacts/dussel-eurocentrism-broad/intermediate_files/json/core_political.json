      "abstract": "Enrique Dussel and John Dewey share commitments to philosophical theory and\n          practice aimed at addressing human problems, democratic modes of inquiry, and progressive social reform, but also maintain productive differences in their fundamental starting point for political philosophy and their use of the social sciences. Dussel provides a corrective to Dewey\u2019s Eurocentrism and to his tendency to underplay the challenges of incorporating marginalized populations by insisting that social and political philosophy begin from the perspective of the marginalized and excluded. Simultaneously, Dewey encourages a modest experimental and fallibilist approach to social transformation that promises more feasible social\n          reforms than Dussel\u2019s approach rooted in phenomenology and the critical social sciences",

By utilizing an interdisciplinary perspective, the research draws upon liberation theology, liberation psychology, liberation pedagogy, and liberation ethics to support the moral mandate for providing education for all God\u2019s children, including those persons with disabilities. The study challenges Catholic educational leaders to reimagine their positions on how schools might promote a more inclusive, liberatory approach to serving the special needs of children with disabilities.

After the \u2018dilution\u2019 of \u201creal\u201d hip-hop by record labels seeking to package the sound for mainstream consumption, is it fair to say that hip-hop retains political relevance? To address this question I make two moves. In the first, I approach hip-hop from a perspective that moves beyond lyrics, seeking to understand what the music \u2018does\u2019 rather than what it represents. In the second, I take this approach to the study of race in hip-hop culture, examining how phenotypical variation affects the affordances and subject-positions available to a given body in hip-hop culture. In approaching hip-hop through the materiality of racial difference, I find that the \u201cpolitical\u201d in hip-hop emerges in moments of creative and ethical experimentation in the face of alterity",

Yet this subject has never ceased to inspire contemporary minds as well. My aim in this paper is to consider the communities known as favelas that have formed on the edges of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro as a contemporary form of utopian community. The paper begins with a brief analysis of the concept of utopia. Then follows a discussion of the Favela as an urban utopia as seen from the perspective of Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel\u2019s philosophy of liberation as represented in his book, The Philosophy of Liberation. The remainder of the paper will consider in what sense the Favela settlements can be understood as a form of utopia. Among additional sources for this paper, I will refer to the research on the favelas by such scholars as Janice Perlman and Catalytic Communities. Other sources will include art projects in the favelas, the novel and film City of God made on site, and photographs of Miguel Rio Branco taken in the Favelas. All of these artists\u2019 representations reflectactual experiences of life in the Favelas. An underlying question throughout will be the role that art might play in understanding utopias",

      "abstract": "Contemporary politics is often said to lack utopias. For prevailing understandings of the practical force of political theory, this looks like cause for celebration. As blueprints to apply to political practice, utopias invariably seem too strong or too weak. Through an immanent critique of political realism, I argue that utopian thought, and political theory generally, is better conceived as supplying an orientation to politics. Realists including Bernard Williams and Raymond Geuss explain how utopian programs like universal human rights poorly orient their adherents to politics, but the realists wrongly conclude that utopias and other ideal theories necessarily disorient us. As I show through an analysis of utopian claims made by Michel Foucault, Malcolm X, and John Rawls, utopias today can effectively disrupt entrenched forms of legitimation, foster new forms of political identity, and reveal new possibilities within existing institutions. Utopias are needed to understand the political choices we face today",

Contemporary philosophy \u2013 especially the reading of Bergson, Heidegger, Arendt, Schmitt, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari \u2013 helps us to do so in at least two ways: first, by testifying that space and the material world represent a kind of obstacle to the visions prevailing in modernity, that give the human being a privileged relationship with time and a right to separate himself from the world in order to dominate it; second, showing us the ways in which spatiality is presented as a political stakes irreducible to both rigid territorializations and pure and simple despatializations. From this point of view, even the current telematic technologies are proof of this irreducibility re-spatializing the world with their systems for tracking, surveillance, monitoring, etc",

We suggest that while postcolonial and related critical theoretical perspectives furthered understandings of the consequences of colonisation, such critical theorising has not provided an epistemological perspective of tourism which legitimises the cosmologies of, and actively empowers, traditionally marginalised groupings. We review published tourism research which adopts critical and postcolonial perspectives, and argue that while these have been valuable in terms of exposing the existence and effects of dominant discourses and practices in tourism, their emancipatory objectives are limited because tourism knowledge is still predominantly colonial. Epistemological decolonisation is thus presented as a more radical project which can provide an \u2018other\u2019 way of thinking, being and knowing about tourism.\n\nKeywords: colonial; decolonisation; decolonial theory; de-linking; epistemological; postcolonia",

      "abstract": "In political, scholarly and cultural discussions in the \u2018Global North\u2019, ideas of freedom, democracy and human rights were considered universal and legitimated for political and military interventions mostly in non-Western countries. Debates about the universality of the right to intervene are discussed in the frame of universality versus particularity. Whereas universalists defend their arguments in the name of modernity, their challengers opposed to these kinds of universal assumptions refer to the importance of particularism\r\nand relativism; yet, both groups consider modernity as their main point of reference. To overcome this stalled discussion, I look at modernity through the deconstruction of epistemic dichotomies and hierarchies in order to open up a space for critical reflection on the concept itself. Contextualizing my reflections on modernity in the rich literature by scholars who challenge the dominant Western concept of modernity, I demonstrate that Western knowledge is not universal in an epistemic sense. Rather, it can be considered as a contentious concept with problematic assumptions about an epistemically\r\nneutral subject, adopting a universalistic perspective while erasing the meaning of geopolitical location (Grosfoguel 2011). Arguing against this idea of an \u2018assertive universality\u2019, the metaphor of \u2019travelling theories,\u2019 as proposed by Edward Said\r\nand Clifford Geertz, helps to reflect upon the local, social and individual positioning of knowledge. The focus of this contribution is the utilisation of feminist and postcolonial perspectives to contribute to the deconstruction of modernity as a homogenous monolithic bloc. Considering the frame itself, I question the hidden, not explicated assumptions in the production of Western knowledge. Arguing that knowledge\r\nproduction is not a question of geography but of epistemology, I deconstruct the modern project from the inside in order to overcome the epistemic dichotomy of modernity itself. The implications of this analysis for us as social scientists and researchers will be discussed at the end of the paper.peer-reviewe",

Second, it presents a methodology running throughout the Series \u2014analogical hermeneutics\u2014to approach the problem of unity. Third, it conceptualises the source of unity as political identity (and solidarity). Fourth, it advances that such identity could be found in a shared, analogical language: the political culture of human rights which is arguably common to all EU present and potential member states. Fifth, it submits the conditions under which such political culture could ground political identity (through an open public sphere). Notwithstanding that the economic crisis can be solved by means of a sound economic strategy (which is not the main object of my work), any successful economic strategy requires\u2014as a precondition\u2014a certain degree of political unity (the central concern of my research)",

      "abstract": "In this article I survey historical writing related to the twentieth-century Afghan-Pakistan frontier, particularly Pashtun-majority locations in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa: the former Northwest Frontier Province. I focus on works that help conceptualize history beyond issues of political economy. Some locate themselves solely in the Anglophone academy, but this is not intended as a complete survey of their field. Rather, I place those works in dialogue with, and prioritize, eclectic histories that are both \u2018about\u2019 and \u2018of\u2019 the borderland; and I discuss this combined field with reference to other scholarly work on \u2018thinking from borders\u2019 in both the political-economic and intellectual-cultural senses. My goal is to intervene in the second set of borders, to disrupt boundaries between global academic culture and \u2018other\u2019 intellectual milieus. Taking tazkiras and autobiographies as examples, I argue that genres of writing from regions heavily fragmented by imperial bordering, among other factors, are social theory in action, not just representation for historians to appropriate. Engaging border history genres and taking seriously the insight they offer requires a willingness to engage the webs of social commitments that produced these works: to work in contribution to their milieus rather than merely writing about them",

Presentamos una historia de esta categor\u00eda que realiza el autor y a partir de la cual se\u00f1ala c\u00f3mo el reconocimiento supone o da por sentado situaciones de desigualdad, tanto pol\u00edtico-jur\u00eddica como econ\u00f3mica. Por tal motivo el autor propone un abandono de esta categor\u00eda y un paso a la tolerancia, en t\u00e9rminos de amor al pr\u00f3jimo. Nosotros proponemos una reconsideraci\u00f3n del reconocimiento, pues sostenemos que puede pensarse desde la diversidad y no \u00fanicamente desde la desigualdad. Incluso en la misma Filosof\u00eda Intercultural que postula FornetBetancourt hay elementos que atienden espec\u00edficamente a la diversidad y\r\na partir de estos intentamos rehabilitar el reconocimiento. Trabajamos tambi\u00e9n los aportes de Arturo Roig, quien retoma esta categor\u00eda desde otras perspectivas te\u00f3ricas y nos permite pensar un reconocimiento leg\u00ed-timo a partir del autoreconocimiento.In this work we analyze the category of recognition proposed by Raul Fornet-Betancourt. We introduce a history of this category that the author makes and from which he indicates how \u201crecognition\u201d supposes situations of inequality, both political, legal and economical. For this reason the author proposes an abandon of this category and go over to \u201ctolerance\u201d, as love to the neighbor or the other. We propose a reconsideration of \u201crecognition\u201d, cause we support it could be thought from diversity and not only from inequality. Even in the same Fornet-Betancourt\u00b4s Intercultural Philosophy, there are elements that attend specifically to diversity\r\nand cause of that we try to rehabilitate \u201crecognition\u201d. We work also Arturo Roig\u2019s contributions since it takes \u201crecognition\u201d from other theoretical perspectives and allows us to think a legitimate recognition from the autorecognition.Fil: Scherbosky, Mar\u00eda Federica.

This article seeks to outline some key aspects of the disputata quaestio about justice, based on the inputs of critical theory. These issues have already been proposed by several authors of Latin American philosophy and it is inspires on some of these developments to advance various ideas about the contextualization of justice that allows progress in a meta-critical dialogue between philosophical traditions, and which some would name \u201canamnestic\" and \u201cintercultural\" justice.

At some level, decolonization ought to be conceived as a kind of translation. Emmanuel Levinas' project to \"translate\" Judaism into Greek is one way of staging such decolonial translation by providing us an internal critique of coloniality while remaining receptive to indigenous inspirations that enrich eco-phenomenological ways of encountering place. In the final instance, however, this paper calls for encountering place through the indigenous languages that make place ethically legible. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]Ye",

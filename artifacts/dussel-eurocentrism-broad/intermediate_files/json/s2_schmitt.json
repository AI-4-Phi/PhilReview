These turn out to be plentiful and illuminating. Yet the nature of Latour\u2019s revision and its implications are obscure. The implications of his notion of cosmopolitics for political theory are minimal, and in other respects the Schmittian picture is unchanged. Unlike Schmitt, who embeds political theory in political theology, and presents a political theology in order to problematize political theory, but provides a meta-theology, Latour presents an alternative political theology, and not a meta-theology.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, a theological turn had a pervasive influence in the reception of Carl Schmitt\u2019s writings. According to this view, his thought has a strong, substantial religious foundation. With regards to understanding not only Schmitt\u2019s position but also his current influence in authoritarian countries, this essay argues that this interpretation is misleading and proposes a different and comprehensive analysis of Schmitt\u2019s concept of political theology that replaces it in a political-legal framework. Against the theological reading, it argues that Schmitt\u2019s concept of \u201cpolitical theology\u201d refers to his own conception of legal theory as an attempt to relegitimize authority in a secular context. As \u201cpolitical theology,\u201d this legal theory is designed to overcome normativism and parliamentarism by \u201csubstantializing\u201d the legal form. Using Schmitt\u2019s post-1933 works as an example, the essay shows that, as theology translates faith into a written doctrine, legal theory must, according to Schmitt, substantialize the legal form by translating the political idea into jurisprudence. Hence, this article concludes that Schmitt\u2019s theory might be described as \u201cpolitical theology\u201d but only in a formal, ideological sense. It is part of an authoritarian theory that is not religious but uses theology to revive an appearance of absolute legitimacy.",

Within the framework of the study, the author draws on the theoretical research of some important European political thinkers of the 20th century for the purpose of interpretation. The means for interpreting Schmitt's doctrine are the ideas of the modern Italian thinker Giorgio Agamben, who develops Schmitt's ideas about sovereign power and state of exception in his extensive project Homo sacer. The novelty of the article lies in the formation of a system of ideas about the main categories of political theology in the light of Schmitt\u2019s and Agamben\u2019s intellectual projects. As a result, the author draws conclusions about the eschatological essence of political theology, the binary nature of sovereignty, the messianic significance of the sovereign and its decision, and links it with the geopolitical concept of nomos of the Earth.",

      "abstract": "The text of C. Schmitt\u2019s \u201cPolitical Theology\u201d was published in 1922, when the actual fall of the Weimar Republic provoked the beginning of the ideological struggle of German intellectuals the result of which was the rise of national socialism. In connection with this, \"Political Theology\" is rightfully considered an actual scientific representation of the history of Germany in the twentieth century, and his theory of sovereignty and sovereignty represents a conditioned choice of the country in favor of national socialism. Unlike most theologians of the 20th century, Schmitt considers political theology as a methodological approach with which it is possible to reconstruct the corresponding (to a particular historical period) picture of the world, using the similarity between metaphysical and state-legal concepts as the basis for such reconstruction. The key concept confirming this similarity is the concept of sovereign, which is historically and legally associated with the concept of absolute power. The author of the article focuses on the multiplicity of interpretations (from purely positive to extremely negative) offered by Schmitt's supporters and opponents regarding his understanding of political theology in general and absolute power in particular. The basis for putting forward a number of critical arguments against Schmitt's political theology is the recognition of its methodological inconsistency, which is explained by the lack of any evidence on the part of its author regarding the identity between theological and state-legal concepts. As a result, political theology is often used as an orthodox rhetorical practice, which leads to direct, non-critical borrowing of religious concepts by modern political leaders.",

      "abstract": "The author of the article attempts to analyze the concept of sovereign according to Carl Schmitt\u2019s legal decisionism and political theology. \u2013 the doctrines developed by the German philosopher and jurist Carl Schmitt (1888\u20131985). Decisionism is rightfully considered as one of the basic concepts of Schmitt\u2019s political and legal discourse. In his voluminous treatise \u201cDictatorship\u201d (1910), Schmitt initiates a detailed doctrine of decizionism, which is based on the adoption of a political decision justified by the relevant authority (and not the law). Later (in 1922), Schmitt publishes his \u201cPolitical Theology\u201d, which again takes into its optics decisionalism and those of its state-legal concepts that can be correlated with theological ones. Sovereign, sovereignty and state of emergency are the first to belong to them. And finally, in his work \u201cOn Three Types of Legal Thinking\u201d (1934), he works out classification of legal thinking (in which it is permissible to assume the simultaneous existence of all three of its types), rejecting normativism and justifying his own inclination towards decisionism and thinking in terms of the specific order. Some researchers of Schmitt\u2019s works \u2013 and in particular his \u201cPolitical Theology\u201d \u2013 believe that by correlating sovereign with God, state of emergency with a miracle, and political action with Way of the Cross, Schmitt tried to protect his doctrine of decisionism from any criticism, since being \u201cpassed\u201d through the prism of the theological, not the critical politics, it became an object of faith, taking the form and expression of an indisputable dogma. In fact, such an \u201cexploratory\u201d vision of Schmitt\u2019s analogies did not explain either the interpretatively complex theory of the sovereign or his political theology, but only simplified and sometimes vulgarized it. While researching the genealogy of political power, Schmitt attempted to establish a type of sovereign being characteristic for a particular era (the Pope \u2013 during the Early and Classical Middle Ages (V\u2013XIV centuries); the Protestant reformer (represented by J. Calvin) \u2013 during the late Middle Ages (XVI century), the absolute monarch \u2013 during the period of European absolutism (XVI\u2013XVIII centuries), the German people \u2013 during the existence of the Weimar Republic in Germany (1918\u20131933), the Reich president \u2013 during the birth of national socialism (the 30s of the XX century). The essential nature of each of them is revealed in the process of taking only those political decisions that the German Schmitt defines as decisions on introducing a state of emergency. At the same time, each epoch \u201csets\u201d its own sovereign, what implies the obligatory subordination of its political decision to the spirit of the time in a particular historical period. Thus, with the progressive development of political theology, (legal) decisionism is also developing, resulted in the concepts of sovereign, sovereignty and emergency decision \u201cacquiring\u201d new semantic meanings",

      "abstract": "Abstract Is there a political theology of revolution in Carl Schmitt or is his political theology only and exclusively autocratic? Schmitt sees the key to revolutionary politics in the construction of the idea of the people as a constituent power. This idea, and the first event it produced, namely, the French Revolution, not only establishes a concrete state of exception but also makes exceptionality both at the same time a constituent and a de-constituent element of the political order of the Modern State. The exception goes from coming from \u201coutside\u201d the political order to being integrated into it as an element of stasis, that is to say, of destabilization. Hence, all modern politics, under the mask of legality, become permanently revolutionary. This article analyses the juridical genealogy and the theological\u2013political transfers involved in the construction of the modern revolutionary political era that follows from Schmitt\u2019s insights.",

      "abstract": "From Christian dominionists in the United States to farright Jewish nationalists in Israel to Hindu supremacists in India, theocratic movements are on the rise. For liberal democrats the stakes seem clear: on one side, reason, secularism, and Enlightenment; on the other, a new dark age. Yet consider a discomforting thought: What if this framing gets the danger all wrong? What if the very democratic systems to which theocracies are counterposed were never actually secular? What if theology has always been constitutive, in some form, of political order\u2014if politics, no matter how modern, must rely, explicitly or covertly, on elements of religion? That is the provocative and timely question posed by Miguel Vatter in this landmark book. For Vatter, the question theorists should ask today is not how the west might finally escape from its entanglement with political theology, but rather how to find the right one: a \u201cdemocratic political theology\u201d that can realize the values of equality and nondomination without slipping into the fetters of market governmentality or charismatic authoritarianism. To help answer it, Vatter traces this quest from its origins in Carl Schmitt to the present day, offering a dazzling and learned retelling of postwar European political thought. Each chapter ofDivine Democracy covers an astounding terrain of texts, authors, and ideas, from ancient Jewish, Christian, Hellenistic, and Roman thought to medieval constitutionalism, early modern and Enlightenment philosophy, and contemporary democratic theory. Just as remarkably, this breadth does not come at the expense of either historical sensitivity or engagement with secondary scholarship. Consider Vatter\u2019s reading of Schmitt. Vatter (1) masterfully shows how Schmitt developed his ideas, in reaction to Hans Kelsen\u2019s discussions of law, representation, state \u201cpersonification,\u201d and political-theological analogies (pp. 25\u201335); (2) transports us back to Hobbes and early modern debates about church\u2013state authority (pp. 35\u2013 48); (3) moves us horizontally through Schmitt\u2019s engagement with Eric Peterson and consequent intellectual evolution (pp. 53\u201357); and (4) sends us forward to consider the normative implications of Schmitt\u2019s ideas on representation for debates in contemporary democratic theory (64\u201365). The same wonderful qualities\u2014richness, nuance and attention to both historical detail and contemporary relevance\u2014characterize the chapters on Voegelin, Maritain, Kantorowicz, and Habermas. Vatter ingeniously links Voegelin, reputed for his conservatism, to post-Marxist Ernesto Laclau\u2019s theory of populism (pp. 91\u201393), whereas Maritain\u2019s analysis of natural law and democracy is joined to Alain Badiou\u2019s \u201cradical universalism\u201d (pp. 122\u201332). With Kantorowicz, we find a fascinating exposition on Dante (pp. 172\u201380), as well as the concept of \u201creverse political theology\u201d: a medieval \u201ctheologization of the law as a way to emancipate forever the modern state from the Church\u201d (pp. 141\u201342, 160). And with Habermas, we discover\u2014with a supporting cast including Hegel, Kant, Cohen, Bloch, Jaspers, L\u00f6with, Derrida, and others\u2014that there is actually a kind of messianic \u201ccondition of possibility\u201d to democratic legitimation (pp. 202\u20133). Divine Democracy does raise a few questions\u2014not so much criticisms as invitations for further discussion. To begin with, the book\u2019s very scope poses a conceptual dilemma. Vatter\u2019s framing implies that it will trace how the specifically Schmittian formulation of political theology is taken up in postwar political thought. In fact, political theology is used in the book in many ways, only some of which fit with Schmitt\u2019s usage (for the better). Schmitt\u2019s stated aim is methodological: we can gain insights into fundamental political issues, like legitimacy, by considering whether their formulation derives from a theological analogue. Vatter impressively demonstrates how each thinker was himself responding to, or building on, Schmitt\u2019s thought. Yet the risk remains of political theology coming to refer to almost any relation between politics and religion\u2014of the concept becoming so \u201cstretched\u201d as to lose its distinctive explanatory power (Giovanni Sartori, \u201cConcept Misformation in Comparative Politics,\u201d American Political Science Review, 64(4), 1970). For instance, is Voegelin\u2019s \u201cpolitical religion\u201dmost accurately understood as a \u201ctheologico-political treatment\u201d of totalitarianism (p. 68)? Or, following Voegelin himself,",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, thinkers like Alain Badiou, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, and Giorgio Agamben have argued for a serious political engagement with early Christian thought and its emphasis on collectivity and community. Notwithstanding their important theoretical contributions, these writers often remain within a limited Eurocentric framework, foreclosing the possibility of a truly decolonial political theology. Crucially, their relatively recent reappraisals tend to ignore important precursors of Christian Marxism from the Global South, namely liberation theology and the philosophy of liberation, as elaborated by the Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel. This essay contextualizes Dussel\u2019s liberational thought in the contexts of political theology and literary representation. It pays particular attention to Dussel\u2019s study of the Theological Metaphors of Marx by synthesizing a model of literary inquiry based on his philosophy and applying it to a reading of counter-hegemonic poetry by the Caribbean poet Pedro Mir, namely his long poem \u201cCountersong to Walt Whitman.\u201d This reading makes explicit the implicit theological dimension of Mir\u2019s poetic text. Finally, the essay conceptualizes this interpretive model as a poetics of liberation: a mode of engagement with mutually determining discourses \u2013 politics, poetics, aesthetics \u2013 as well as a mode of reading which unravels the transformation of these discourses in lyrical forms. Writing from the periphery of the US empire, Mir therefore constructs a mode of address which arms itself with both political and theological discourses, however implicitly. To the empire\u2019s miraculous state of exception, Mir counterpoises a redemptive state of rebellion.",

By focusing on the work of prominent members of the Ritter School \u2013 Hermann L\u00fcbbe, Ernst-Wolfgang B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde, and Odo Marquard \u2013 and on the contributions of Hans Blumenberg, I will demonstrate how Schmitt\u2019s thought was appropriated and critically inverted, in order to provide theoretical support to liberalism. This project of liberalizing Schmitt involved developing a \u201cweak decisionism,\u201d which avoids the state of exception, providing a liberalist reading of Schmitt\u2019s Hobbes-inspired narrative on the origin of the modern state and even formulating a \u201cpolitical polytheology.\u201d Finally, this article offers a reflection on \u201cpolitical theology\u201d as a conceptual field. I argue that the liberal\u2013conservative, \u201cneutralizing\u201d reading of Schmitt is to some extent already available as an option within this framework, and I conclude that this finding problematizes Schmitt\u2019s own dualistic antagonism.",

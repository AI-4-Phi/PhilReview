      "abstract": "The need to rethink the classical European systems that excluded the possibility of the existence (of the idea) of the Other from the ontological order was a key factor in the self-determination of subjects representing a nonWestern type of philosophical discourse. Un-ontological status deprived the Other of the right to be a subject and deprived his words of authenticity. The author of the article analyzes the views of Enrique Dussel, one of the primary figures in the Philosophy of Liberation philosophical movement. An attempt to justify the existential status of the Other is made by E. Dussel by addressing European philosophers, whose ideas intended to overcome the anti-anthropological attitude and dehumanization tendencies, once begotten by the discourse of Totality. The content of the concept of the Other is clarified through its correlation with the concept of the Otherness. The explanatory potential of these ideas is revealed for the possibility of bringing the Other out of oblivion. Keywords\u2014Enrique Dussel; Latin American Philosophy of Liberation; anthropological protest; Totality; Other; Otherness",

      "abstract": "This article analyzes the work of Walter Benjamin, focusing on his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" and his critique of progress as a central axis of capitalist and socialist modernity. Drawing on the reflections of Bol\u00edvar Echeverr\u00eda and Enrique Dussel, the text argues, from a reading that intertwines Benjamin's Jewish condition and his connection with European culture, that the vision of progress is a historical construction that hides the underlying barbarity in power structures, both in capitalism and in real socialism. When the author proposes his interpretation of history \"against the grain,\" he challenges the linear and triumphalist conception of progress, proposing a historical materialism based on the memory of the oppressed and the redemption of the victims of the past. The work also highlights how Benjamin's critique of modernity, far from being an abstract reflection, has a practical and revolutionary dimension, linking his ideas with Latin American liberation philosophies and the need for a new critical look at history. In this sense, the article argues that theology, in Benjamin's thought, does not propose a doctrine, nor a treatise on God, but rather a critical tool that allows for the interruption of the hegemonic narrative of progress and the reconfiguration of social struggles from a radically new perspective, centered on resistance and the historical transformation of the oppressed.",

After defining liberation theology, this study identifies the crucial contributions made to it by Emmanuel Levinas\u2019s assertion of the primacy of ethics over ontology and critique of the egocentric nature of Western philosophy. It then delineates the epistemological and deontological criticisms made of Roman Catholic orthodoxy\u2014and institutionalized Christianity in general\u2014by Latin American liberation theologians, particularly Enrique Dussel and Jos\u00e9 Porfirio Miranda. These are compared with Wang\u2019s critique of the Rationalist Neo-Confucianism that had been official orthodoxy and the legitimating philosophy for imperial China for three centuries. The study finds that Wang\u2019s Idealist philosophy incorporates epistemological, spiritual, and ethical perspectives with powerful democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure the development of late-twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. Thus, contrary to the conventional view of Confucianism as a conservative philosophy, these elements in Wang\u2019s Neo-Confucianism render it a theology (or philosophy) of liberation.",

This essay places Goswami\u2019s critique within a context of \u201cthe thought from outside,\u201d which, beginning with Foucault\u2019s reading of Blanchot, continuing through the geopolitics of Dussel\u2019s philosophy of liberation, and prominent in Catherine Malabou\u2019s conceptualization of plasticity, demonstrates how political critiques of philosophical hegemony contain an implicit theorization of \u201cliterature.\u201d If \u201cliterature\u201d gives voice to the thought from outside, does it in turn \u201cdecolonize\u201d philosophy? If so, what itinerary of thought ought to follow the relationship between this literary decolonization of philosophy and its imbrication within the fold of philosophical thought? How to conceptualize the plastic relation between inside and outside, between center and periphery, without subordinating the latter to the hegemony of the former? This essay argues for a coherence between Goswami\u2019s and Malabou\u2019s materialist understandings of difference and a conceptualization of literature as an \u201coutside\u201d to philosophy that operates \u201cexcentrically\u201d \u201cinside\u201d philosophy.",

In this direction, we take as reference the propositions of Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation (PL), which are critically situated in Latin America. In the first part, we present a comprehensive overview of this vast oeuvre, justified by the partial and even incoherent appropriation that has been happening in OS. In the second part, we discuss some of these appropriations considering some Latin American authors of the OS field, highlighting specially the Brazilian context. This critical dialogue is indispensable to liberate the path for the contribution of Dussel's PL to the exercise of a critique that negates, side by side with the victims, the legitimacy of a system that explores and oppresses, and that, simultaneously, gets involved with the affirmation of human life in community, and therefore, with the praxis of liberation.",

      "abstract": "This paper analyzes Enrique Dussel's ethics of liberation from a propositional logic perspective, evaluating the validity of its ethical-practical framework as a basis for the praxis of his philosophy of liberation. Initially, an outline of the fundamental principles and criteria that compose this ethics is provided. Subsequently, the framework is subjected to a basic logical review, revealing significant inconsistencies that could compromise its validity. Among the main observations, it is highlighted that dividing the framework into two strands is unnecessary and counterproductive, as it could be structured as a single practical and logically coherent framework. Furthermore, a deeper critique is posed regarding the assumption of transforming specific aspects of capitalism to reduce its victimizing effects, since this system, by its very nature, generates victims. It is concluded that total structural transformation is a prerequisite for any ethical process of liberation. Only after establishing a new system could the necessary adjustments be addressed to mitigate the new forms of oppression that may eventually emerge. Thus, it is argued that, from a logical perspective, revolution must be the unavoidable starting point of Dussel's framework.\u00a0",

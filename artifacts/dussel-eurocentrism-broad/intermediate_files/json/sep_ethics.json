        "His incomplete magnum opus Filosof\u00eda de la realidad hist\u00f3rica (1991) aimed to develop a philosophy of history that celebrated the \u201chistorical intelligence\u201d that is the sediment of praxical beings taking charge of their historical reality that aims at greater liberty. It is to be noted that Ellacur\u00eda\u2019s philosophy of history and \u201cfeeling logos\u201d have been most effectively taken up in Dussel\u2019s most recent work on the ethics and politics of liberation, which is one reason that, as was noted above, the \u201canalectical\u201d designator may no longer be a useful denomination for a current that has been influenced so profoundly by recent developments in Latin American philosophy (Dussel 1998, 2007, 2009, 2017, 2018; Bautista 2014; Grant 2020; Mills 2018).",
        "This problem is the other side of the question about the historical subject of liberation. What is the relationship between the individual subject, whether it be conceive as an epistemic or ethical agent, and their belonging to a macro-historical subject, where this may be conceived as \u201cel pueblo\u201d that is either a national-cultural unit, or a transnational, cultural entity, such as the \u201cAmericas\u201d. As a chapter in phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy, the philosophy liberation has addressed the nature of the particular and distinct embodied, free, historically located, and dependent subject.",

Mill and Taylor tend to overemphasize the roles of women who are wives. Mill\u2019s works especially emphasize the benefits to family and domestic life as reasons to support the liberation of women from subjugation.",

        "Arguments against gender abolition suggest that gender abolition comes with new costs of its own, including the failure to do justice to the gender identifications of trans people (Cull 2019, Jenkins 2016, Kapusta 2016), when self-labeling as a particular gender may be a morally valuable form of agency (Camp and Flores 2024). Gender-norm authenticity may be liberating and morally important to individuals (Bell 2024). The salience of gendered caregiving roles for ethical reasoning has been a major focus of feminist ethics.",
        "Some Black feminists have advocated for a framework of the \u201cpolitics of care,\u201d arguing that \u201ccare does more than require a posture of mutual respect, responsibility, and obligation between individuals\u201d and propose instead non-ideal theories of care rooted in liberation struggles which present \u201cnew possibilities for living together\u201d (Woodley 2021, 891\u20132). Relational approaches have been particularly important in the development of feminist bioethics (Jennings 2016; Sherwin and Stockdale 2017; Stoljar and Mackenzie 2022) (see also the entry on Feminist Bioethics), gender-affirming and trans youth care (Marvin 2019), and animal ethics (Gruen 2015)."

To achieve this ascent, the students have to undergo, first, a preparatory schooling of ten years\u2019 duration in the \u2018liberal arts\u2019: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and theoretical harmonics (518c\u2013531c).",

Underlying these political disagreements was the distinction between \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d environmental movements, a distinction introduced in the early 1970s by another major influence on contemporary environmental ethics, the Norwegian philosopher and climber Arne N\u00e6ss.",
        "Feminism represents a radical challenge for environmental thinking, politics, and traditional social ethical perspectives. It promises to link environmental questions with wider social problems concerning various kinds of discrimination and exploitation, and fundamental investigations of human psychology. However, whether there are conceptual, causal or merely contingent connections among the different forms of oppression and liberation remains a contested issue (see Green 1994).",
        "Some writers have argued, for example, that critical theory is bound to be ethically anthropocentric, with nature as no more than a \u201csocial construction\u201d whose value ultimately depends on human determinations (see Vogel 1996). Others have argued that the demands of \u201cdeep\u201d green theorists and activists cannot be accommodated within contemporary theories of liberal politics and social justice (see Ferry 1995).",

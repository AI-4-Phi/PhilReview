We suggest that while postcolonial and related critical theoretical perspectives furthered understandings of the consequences of colonisation, such critical theorising has not provided an epistemological perspective of tourism which legitimises the cosmologies of, and actively empowers, traditionally marginalised groupings. We review published tourism research which adopts critical and postcolonial perspectives, and argue that while these have been valuable in terms of exposing the existence and effects of dominant discourses and practices in tourism, their emancipatory objectives are limited because tourism knowledge is still predominantly colonial. Epistemological decolonisation is thus presented as a more radical project which can provide an \u2018other\u2019 way of thinking, being and knowing about tourism.\n\nKeywords: colonial; decolonisation; decolonial theory; de-linking; epistemological; postcolonia",

Approaching this question with regard to Pakistan and Afghanistan opens a series of conceptual questions that\n\nare useful beyond these cases. Above all, we contend that support to marginal specializations, particularly in service of making them less marginal, must involve an openness to the world beyond professional academic life. By this, we first mean an openness to different purposes for knowledge that are related to political and social stakes in countries other than India. Second, we suggest the need for a greater openness to different sources and forms of knowledge than have traditionally been admitted into academic conversation in the global north",

      "abstract": "In political, scholarly and cultural discussions in the \u2018Global North\u2019, ideas of freedom, democracy and human rights were considered universal and legitimated for political and military interventions mostly in non-Western countries. Debates about the universality of the right to intervene are discussed in the frame of universality versus particularity. Whereas universalists defend their arguments in the name of modernity, their challengers opposed to these kinds of universal assumptions refer to the importance of particularism\r\nand relativism; yet, both groups consider modernity as their main point of reference. To overcome this stalled discussion, I look at modernity through the deconstruction of epistemic dichotomies and hierarchies in order to open up a space for critical reflection on the concept itself. Contextualizing my reflections on modernity in the rich literature by scholars who challenge the dominant Western concept of modernity, I demonstrate that Western knowledge is not universal in an epistemic sense. Rather, it can be considered as a contentious concept with problematic assumptions about an epistemically\r\nneutral subject, adopting a universalistic perspective while erasing the meaning of geopolitical location (Grosfoguel 2011). Arguing against this idea of an \u2018assertive universality\u2019, the metaphor of \u2019travelling theories,\u2019 as proposed by Edward Said\r\nand Clifford Geertz, helps to reflect upon the local, social and individual positioning of knowledge. The focus of this contribution is the utilisation of feminist and postcolonial perspectives to contribute to the deconstruction of modernity as a homogenous monolithic bloc. Considering the frame itself, I question the hidden, not explicated assumptions in the production of Western knowledge. Arguing that knowledge\r\nproduction is not a question of geography but of epistemology, I deconstruct the modern project from the inside in order to overcome the epistemic dichotomy of modernity itself. The implications of this analysis for us as social scientists and researchers will be discussed at the end of the paper.peer-reviewe",

      "abstract": "Este art\u00edculo compara dos forma de traducir el conocimiento de los subalternos en Am\u00e9rica Latina. Por un lado, en las dos \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, los estudios decoloniales han tratado de proponer una forma alternativa para pensar el continente centr\u00e1ndose en el conocimiento de las comunidades locales. Las estrategias de traducci\u00f3n utilizadas por estudios descoloniales apuntan a poner el conocimiento de los subalternos en el centro de un proyecto intelectual descolonizaci\u00f3n. Por otro lado, mucho antes del surgimiento de los estudios decoloniales, Bolivia fue escenario de un proyecto de traducci\u00f3n sumamente interesante que fundamentado en el conocimiento ind\u00edgena. En la d\u00e9cada de 1980, el Taller de Historia Oral Andina (THOA) desarroll\u00f3 un proceso epist\u00e9mico, cuyo objetivo principal fue la recuperaci\u00f3n de las experiencias ind\u00edgenas para la construcci\u00f3n de nuevos marcos anal\u00edticos. La traducci\u00f3n fue uno de los ejes de este proyecto historiogr\u00e1fico, fue utilizada como una herramienta en la lucha de estas comunidades para articular sus historias a su manera. Porque el THOA es pr\u00e1cticamente desconocido en Am\u00e9rica Latina, sus m\u00faltiples contribuciones \u1e55ara rearticular los discursos subalternos trav\u00e9s de la traducci\u00f3n han sido poco estudiadas. Al contrastar estos dos proyectos, este trabajo muestra los usos y abusos de la traducci\u00f3n del conocimiento subalterno en Am\u00e9rica LatinaAs a cultural text based on deeply conflicted social accents, Pascual Co\u00f1a\u2019s testimonial work continues to question different generations of readers-addresses, asking each of them \u2014and us\u2014 to take a position, to make an interpretation of the events and the participants which would always be historically located. In the light of other previous and contemporary readings, this article examines Co\u00f1a\u2019s diverse and even opposite footings across time in three dissimilar though related contexts: discourse production, the n\u00fctram \u2018stories\u2019 included in the book, and the circulation contexts for the published work. From a perspective that istinguishes in this work the interaction of multiple voices, the analysis incorporates the notion of contact zone, understood as the social space in which geographically and historically separated peoples come into contact and establish lasting relations based on coercion, inequality, and conflict (Pratt, 1992). It concludes that Pascual Co\u00f1a\u2019s work, on the one hand, manages to subvert the \u00abauthor\u00bb role that Moesbach allocated to himself in the first edition\r\nand, on the other, it also gains profound sense within the framework of the saga of narratives circulating in the area about the tragic fates of leading Mapuche longko on both sides of the Andes after their defea",

It is basically a call towards a just social order that gives priority to human life. It is inherently ethical and fundamentally liberational. This work looks into the insufficiency of Modern Ethiopian establishment in attaining an inclusive and pluralist arrangement. It assumes this establishment as a hegemonic totality that marginalizes its others. It argues that the Modern Ethiopian establishment is an ontologic totality that needs to be liberated and transformed. Based on Dussel\u2019s Philosophy and Ethics of Liberation, Transmodern Ethiopia is anticipated as an entity that could transcend the Modern and come up with a different arrangement. This would be an ethical arrangement which accepts the other as other. The three principles of Ethics of Liberation (material principle, formal principle and feasibility principle) are used as an ethical framework for the construction.Key words: Transmodernity, Liberation philosophy, Analectic, Ethics of Liberation, Modern Ethiopia, Transmodern Ethiopia, Pluriversal polylogu",

In my perception and interpretation, I shall deal with the theoretical-methodological implications of the testimonies-artistic works of this revolutionary Christian community. How can a person from far away India listen to and interact with the voices from Solentiname, Nicaragua, and produce \u201cscientific\u201d knowledge about the same in a context where the very framework (terms, words, categories, concepts, methodologies, etc.) of the production of that knowledge, emanates from the processes of colonization/otherization/domination of the non-western? The point of discussion is the ambivalent tension between the \u201csubject\u201d and the \u201cobject\u201d of the research, localized on the exteriority (the two \u201cOthers\u201d are relatively different but not distinct) to the modern-colonial scientific paradigm, whose basic research framework must shape the process of research. Subsequently, it discusses a useful methodological-theoretical praxis of \u201cNon-negligence\u201d\u2014of Buddhist soteriological origins\u2014in interaction with the works of decolonial studies and, also with the concepts of reflexivity and epistemological vigilance debated in recent developments in social sciences, seeking to engage in a conversation by way of a pluriversal translation.&nbsp",

      "abstract": "For a long time, colonial modernity has tried to rehabilitate Muslims with \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam to repress the \u201cradical\u201d potential in their culture. Tariq Ali\u2019s Shadows of the Pomegranate Tree problematizes this crisis in an Andalusian story. Andalusia has been revisited since its fall in 1492. Squeezed between philia and phobia, Andalusia is either de-orientalized by nostalgic counter-narrations coming from the Global South and East, or it is under the influence of re-Westernization, epitomized by recent anti-immigration sentiment in the Global North. Does it make Andalusia an impossible state, then? Against modernist \u201cnation in becoming\u201d or postmodernist transcendental green nationalism projects, Andalusia, nevertheless, will become a decolonized option as an intercultural plurinational state in this article. Islam has been in a defensive position against the West and modernity. It is now time to come forward with its epistemologies and stop trying to persuade the West. It is time to \u201cwrite what we want\u201d and \u201cchange the interlocutor\u201d. Its convivencia, dhimma, \u00fclfet, and cyclical history will decolonize modernist myths of democracy, secularism, and linear historiography, respectively",

      "abstract": "This essay explores one possible interpretation on how Latin American intellectuals and activists use the concept of utopia. &nbsp;The first part of the essay provides a sketch of how European and US scholars, particularly those following Ernst Bloch, have articulated utopia. &nbsp;The section ends with a pessimistic reading of utopia due to the institutional power of settler colonialism, white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy. &nbsp;In the second section of the essay, the author begins by using some of the work of Jose Boaventura de Sousa Santos to explore Quijano\u2019s coloniality of power. &nbsp;In the process the author demonstrates how much of European thought around utopia assumes knowledge as an un-positioned, un-located, neutral, and universalistic position. &nbsp;So utopia, as articulated by European thinkers, becomes part of the violent history and epistemology that invented America and can be said to be tainted with this original sin. &nbsp;In response, Latin American scholars and activists turn to concepts that emerge from struggles of resistance against Eurocentric thought and practices, like sumac kaway, pachamama, or the Zapatista struggles to restore utopia as part of the struggle for el buen vivir. &nbsp;This approach helps disentangle ourselves from the projects of modernity and permits a collective mode of thinking that is produced and thought from difference, towards liberation. &nbsp;So Latin American activists and scholars, like others from the Global South, are endeavoring to reevaluate utopia by going beyond European thought and restoring value to the struggles of communities whose heritage have been erased, especially native communities that have resisted coloniality",

      "abstract": "In the last years, more and more literary accounts of recent and current wars in the Middle East have been published. In most cases, they are authored from a Western viewpoint and provide a narrow account of the Muslim world. This article focuses on Sinan Antoon's The Corpse Washer because it opens the scope. That is, it constitutes an alternative to the imagery of the American film industry. Moreover, as Antoon is a Christian, his account of contemporary Iraq is particularly peripheral and hybrid. To analyse the novel, this article makes use of Transmodernity, a concept coined by Rosa Maria Rodriguez Magda in 1989. Yet, instead of Magda's Transmodernity as a neatly Euro-centric phenomenon of worldwide connectivity, Ziauddin Sardar's version of the concept is preferred. Sardar's Transmodernity adds to connectivity a message of reconciliation between progress and tradition, particularly in the context of non-Western cultures. This paper defends that Antoon's novel opens the debate on Islam to challenge the prejudiced Western discourses that have legitimized' war. To do so, Sardar's borders' and Judith Butler's grievability are particularly useful. In a Transmodern context, novels like Antoon's show that humans should never be bare lives",

      "abstract": "Based on Maldonado-Torres\u2019s formulation of the term, we conceive the decolonial turn as a form of liberating and decolonising reason beyond the liberal and Enlightened emancipation of rationality, and beyond the more radical Euro-critiques that have failed to consistently challenge the legacies of Eurocentrism and white male heteronormativity (often Eurocentric critiques of Eurocentrism). We complement Maldonado-Torres\u2019s account of the decolonial turn in philosophy, theory and critique by providing an analysis of the trajectories of academic philosophy and clarifying the relevance of decolonising philosophy and of the decolonial turn for current efforts in transforming philosophy in face of the challenges of social movements such as the Third World Liberation Front and Black Lives Matter in the United States, and Rhodes Must Fall in South Africa and England. After a brief analysis of the trajectory and current status of philosophy as a discipline in the modern Western research university, we provide examples of the decolonial turn and of decolonising philosophy in three areas: the engagement with (1) Asian and (2) Latin American philosophies, and (3) debates in the philosophy of race and gender",

      "abstract": "This essay will study the relationship of religion and politics in the context of two specific liturgical practices. These practices originate in the historical congregations formed during the Liberation Theology movement in Latin America and in the context of the neo-Buddhist Ambedkarite movements in India. The idea of the congregation will be articulated with the liturgical logic of \u201cpublic service\u201d in so far as the Greek word(s) for liturgy refers both to the physical assembly of citizens and the structural capacity for creating a space for the \u201ccommon.\u201d Coupling congregation with the collective sharing of a \u201ccommon feeling\u201d (Ambedkar) provides the essential material for a political analysis of two historical societies of the global South. In the case of Chile, from the time of the reign of Pinochet, political resistance came from several quarters, including that of the Christian religion, not as practiced by the Church but as a subversive challenge posed by Liberation Theology. The Ambedkarite conversion from Hinduism to Buddhism in 1956 created a strange conjuncture, wherein conversion both signified liberation from the erstwhile religious oppression of the Hindus and the entry into a new form of communitarian thought. But the future of such an act of conversion could only be realized in history if the forms of thought of a new Buddhism were to be actualized in real ethical-political practices of a people called Dalits, which means being oppressed. This paper will confront the precarious task of a comparative analysis of incommensurable situations and affirm the political universalism of a world-historical tradition of the oppressed/Dalit",

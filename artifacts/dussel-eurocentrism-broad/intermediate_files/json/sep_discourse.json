        "Maeve Cooke argues that Habermas\u2019s theory contains implicitly a \u201cutopian promise\u201d of a rationalized lifeworld, that is \u201creproduced through processes of intersubjective evaluation of validity claims\u201d (Cooke 1994: 162), so that substantial ethical reasons ground its normative claims. Other commentators, such as Honneth, assume that discourse ethics provides the account of its normative foundations that, according to Habermas, earlier critical theory stood in need of (Honneth 1985 [1991: 282]).",
        "Instead, it is an evolving research programme, presented in a series of essays most of which are contained in two volumes published in English as Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (1990a) and Justification and Application (1993). The development of Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics falls into two phases, roughly 1983\u20131990 and 1991\u20131996.",

This assumption has been bolstered by the tendency, prevalent until recently, to base an understanding of Descartes\u2019 philosophy primarily on his two most famous books, Discourse on the Method and Meditations on First Philosophy.",
        "The best-known expression of Descartes\u2019 ethical views is the \u201cprovisional moral code\u201d (une morale par provision) that appears in Part Three of Discourse on the Method. Some have read this as a reliable statement of Descartes\u2019 considered position, but this is consistent neither with the content of the Discourse itself nor with that of his later writings.",

        "Here is it worth noting that while it is virtue that links ethics to the broader goal of the cultivation of reason, Descartes gives no less weight to the importance of happiness, in the form of tranquility. This is made clear near the end of the Discourse, when he explains why, in spite of his reservations, he has published the book under his own name: \u201cI am not excessively fond of glory\u2014indeed if I dare to say so, I dislike it in so far as I regard it as opposed to that tranquility which I value above everything else\u2026."

        "At the heart of discourse theory is a principle of discursive justification that Habermas refers to as the \u201cdiscourse principle\u201d or \u201cD,\u201d which states: \u201cjust those norms of action are valid if all persons affected could agree as participants in rational discourse\u201d (Habermas 1992 [1996, 107]).",
        "He further specifies discourse theory with a universalization principle (\u201cU\u201d) that is operative when arguing about moral norms, and a democratic principle that is operative when attempting to justify legal norms within a democratic society."

        "Although it differs from discourse ethics in important respects, this account also promises to ground public reason in a broader account of the nature of social morality and epistemology. It is thus also vulnerable to similar worries about whether public reason ought to be embedded in a comprehensive and controversial philosophical theory of morality and epistemology.",
        "For example, some suggest that everyone affected by some proposed norm should be a participant in the public use of reason regarding the validity of that norm, provided they are willing to engage in a respectful justificatory dialogue with others (e.g. Bohman 2003).

        "Much of the literature on this subject focuses on the question of whether the Internet encourages or hampers the free exercise of deliberative public reason, in a manner informed by J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s (1992/1998) account of discourse ethics and deliberative democracy in the public sphere (Ess 1996 and 2005b; Dahlberg 2001; Bohman 2008).",
        "A related debate concerns the ethical and social value of the kind of social media acts of moral policing frequently derided as insincere or performative \u2018virtue signaling.\u2019 To what extent are social media platforms a viable stage for moral performances, and are such performances merely performative? Are they inherently \u2018grandstanding\u2019 abuses of moral discourse (Tosi and Warmke 2020), or can they in fact be positive forces for social progress and reform (Levy 2020, Westra 2021)?",
        "When SNS in particular are considered in light of these questions, some distinctive considerations arise. First, sites like Facebook and Twitter (as opposed to narrower SNS utilities such as LinkedIn) facilitate the sharing of, and exposure to, an extremely diverse range of types of discourse."

That is to say, happiness or well-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought and conduct, and the virtues (aret\u00ea: \u2018excellence\u2019) are the dispositions/skills needed to attain it.",
        "The difficulties of assessing Plato\u2019s ethical thought are compounded by the fact that the metaphysical underpinnings seem to change during his long life. In the Socratic dialogues, there are no indications that the search for virtue and the human good goes beyond the human realm.",
        "Though Plato\u2019s late works do not show any willingness to lower the standards of knowledge as such, Plato indicates that his design of a rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an acknowledgment that finds its counterpart in his more pragmatic treatment of ethical standards and political institutions in his last political work, the Laws."

He took up this insight through the philosophy of discourse that he developed on the basis of the increased emphasis on language in his philosophy.",
        "To make sense of the fullness of language, therefore, philosophy has to develop a theory of interpretation since actual discourse is not always, if ever univocal and its meanings do change over time when acts of discourse outlive the speakers and situations in which they were originally produced."

      "abstract": "This paper examines and assesses Hume's skepticism regarding the social contract theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Consequently, Hume, in response to the assertions of contractarians who argued that political power is founded on a contract among rational individuals, contended that political authority originates from custom, use, and historical precedent. His critique consequently refutes the function of reason in establishing the legitimacy of political institutions, contending that they develop over time. Hume adopts a radical enlightenment perspective, asserting that every revolution always results in political instability. The paper seeks to elucidate the political theories of David Hume and articulate the relevance of this philosopher's ideas in analyzing contemporary politics and political systems, as well as in assessing which political frameworks should be considered legitimate today. This research analyses Hume's perspectives on custom, gradualism, and the emotional foundation of political authority, providing a comprehensive account of political legitimacy in historical and present contexts.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the critique of social contract theory in Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan through the lens of Georges Bataille's notion of sacrifice. Bataille and Hobbes share several key motifs, including death, violence and sovereignty. However, they interpret these motifs in different ways. Hobbes rationalises these concepts by introducing the concept of the social contract, whereby individuals relinquish their freedom in exchange for security. For him, the state is a means of protecting people\u2019s lives through rational submission to the social contract. In contrast, Bataille emphasises the role of the irrational and the sacred, viewing them as a means of liberation from the fear of death, the material world and domination. Sacrifice plays a pivotal role in Bataille's philosophy, serving as a conduit to the sacred and a unifying force within communities through shared experiences of loss and sacrifice. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that over time, the significance of sacrifice has increased in terms of utilitarian value, while its intrinsic value as an act of gratuitous giving for the sake of affirming the \"fertility of life\" has diminished. Hobbes's social contract can be presented in basic terms as the sacrifice of a good for the sake of exchanging it for another good. This is exemplified by the exchange of the right to liberty for protection from the sovereign. For both Hobbes and Bataille, the fear of death is the rationale behind the relinquishment of freedom and the introduction of prohibitions. But Bataille, unlike Hobbes, proposes to build society not on the fear of death, but on overcoming this fear and sovereign rejection - the rejection of both one's freedom and the transfer of it to someone else. Thus, reading Leviathan through Bataille's logic helps to debunk the image of the sovereign as a mortal god and omnipotent protector.",

This work presents Hume's critique of the Lockean version of the social contract, and identifies the issues responsible for such criticism. In Book 3 of Hume's Treatise on Human Nature (henceforth T), Hume displays his systematic criticism of social contract theory. Hume did not consider social contract theory as an important trend in the history of political thought. One of his points was that 'social contract theory' was quite new, strange and 'heterodoxical' in politics. This work offers an appraisal of Hume\u2019s stance on the Lockean variant of \u201cSocial Contract Theory\u201d and proposes a more judicious textual reading of his contributions in this regard.",

      "abstract": "While the Value-Free Ideal (VFI) had many precursors, it became a solidified bulwark of normative claims about scientific reasoning and practice in the mid-twentieth century. Since then, it has played a central role in the philosophy of science, first as a basic presupposition of how science should work, then as a target for critique, and now as a target for replacement. In this paper, we will argue that a narrow focus on the VFI is misguided, because the VFI coalesced in the midst of other important shifts in the relationship between science and society. In particular, the mid-twentieth century saw the acceptance of the \u201csocial contract for science,\u201d a tacit agreement between scientists and government officials, and more broadly between science and society. It was built around three core concepts: a distinction between basic and applied science, a conception of scientific freedom that limited social responsibility for scientists, and a justification for public funding of basic science in the form of the linear model. Within the conceptual framework of the social contract for science, it is clearer both (1) why the VFI was adopted, (2) why it is difficult to replace the VFI within the old social contract, and (3) how we need to revise the social contract for science in order to replace the VFI.",

      "abstract": ": John Locke's thought on natural law possesses both destructive and constructive qualities. Its destructiveness lies in the profound critique of the divine right of kings, whereas its constructiveness is primarily articulated through a systematic exposition of social contract theory. The foundation of social contract theory is built upon the support for individual freedom and rights, economic freedom, and property rights. The transition from the state of nature to the formation of government is key, involving the partial surrender of people's rights, while the essence of effective government operation is the limitation of state power. Human rights and the contract grant legitimate life to the government, while the implementation of separation of powers and the rule of law ensures the practical realization of human rights. Locke's social contract theory has a profound impact on modern democratic politics and the construction of the rule of law, warranting repeated reading and contemplation.",

More specifically, our analysis draws from the work of Charles W. Mills, a philosopher of race and liberalism, as well as the theoretical and praxis framework of intersectionality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSocial contract theory supports hierarchies and inequities that may be used to sustain unfair and unjust differences in oral health between social groups. When dentistry's social contract becomes a tool of oppression, its practice does not promote health equity but reinforces damaging social norms.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDentistry must embrace an anti-oppression framing of equity and elevate the principle of justice to one of liberation and not just fairness. In doing so, the profession can better understand itself, act more equitably and empower practitioners to advocate for justice in health and healthcare in its fullest sense. Anti-oppressive justice supports health not as merely an obligation but as a human duty.",

Informed by Sylvia Wynter\u2019s generative notion of genre, I show that by centering on freedom rather than oppression, Wittig\u2019s affirmation of the genre of contract represents a compelling and emancipatory alternative to feminist and critical race critiques.

Beginning with the famous phrase \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains,\" Rousseau questions the source of legitimate political authority. The work argues that individuals must renounce their natural liberty and unite around a \"General Will\" formed by their own volition. Through this contract, individuals gain civil liberty and property rights. The book emphasizes that sovereignty belongs to the people and is inalienable and indivisible. While presenting direct democracy as the ideal form of government, Rousseau states that the government is merely a servant of the people. Furthermore, by examining the origins of inequality (in the Discourses section), he critiques how private property and civilization have corrupted human nature.",

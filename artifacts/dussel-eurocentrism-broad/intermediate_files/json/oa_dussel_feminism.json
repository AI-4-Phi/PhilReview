      "abstract": "This special issue of Transmodernity, \"Thinking through the Decolonial Turn: Post-Continental Interventions in Theory, Philosophy, and Critique,\" stands on three fundamental premises that serve as the starting point for the dialogical encounters between intellectuals from Latin America, the Caribbean, and from minoritized sectors in the United States, particularly Latina/o and African American, who are featured here.The first one is that just as there has been a linguistic and a pragmatic turn, among other such turns in theory and philosophy, there has also being a decolonial turn with distinct features, some of which will be elucidated in these two issues. 1Different from these other turns, however, the decolonial turn has long existed in different ways, opposing what could be called the colonizing turn in Western thought, by what I mean the paradigm of discovery and newness that also included the gradual propagation of capitalism, racism, the modern/gender system, and the naturalization of the death ethics of war. 2 The second premise or fundamental hypothesis is that the decolonial turn is anchored in specific forms of skepticism and epistemic attitudes out of which certain critical questions and the search for answers are generated.And the third is that this turn, its form of skepticism and attitude, are arguably most at home in spaces such as ethnic studies and gender and women's studies departments, units, and research centers in the Western academy, as well as in different institutions such as indigenous universities and among decolonial activists, independent scholars, and artists across the entire spectrum of the Global South, including the south in the north. 3To be sure, that the decolonial turn is particularly at home in spaces such as ethnic, women, or gender studies does not mean that every scholar in such spaces is effectively thinking through and contributing to the decolonial turn, or that the decolonial turn can only be found in such spaces.Arguably, because of its emancipatory goals and its suspension of method, the decolonial turn cannot be fully contained in single units of study, or captured within the standard division of labor between disciplines or areas in the traditional arts and sciences.What is at stake is the larger task of the very decolonization of knowledge, power, and being, including institutions such as the university. 4e Decolonial Turn I have provided an initial genealogy and a description of the decolonial turn elsewhere, and Walter Mignolo adds important considerations in his contribution to this issue, but a succinct introductory note is in place here. 5 Decolonial thinking has existed since the very inception of modern forms of colonization-that is, since at least the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries-, and, to that extent, a certain decolonial turn has existed as well, but the more massive",

      "abstract": "Despite unprecedented access to information and diffusion of knowledge across the globe, the bulk of work in mainstream psychological science still reflects and promotes the interests of a privileged minority of people in affluent centers of the modern global order. Compared to other social science disciplines, there are few critical voices who reflect on the Euro-American colonial character of psychological science, particularly its relationship to ongoing processes of domination that facilitate growth for a privileged minority but undermine sustainability for the global majority. Moved by mounting concerns about ongoing forms of multiple oppression (including racialized violence, economic injustice, unsustainable over-development, and ecological damage), we proposed a special thematic section and issued a call for papers devoted to the topic of \"decolonizing psychological science\". In this introduction to the special section, we first discuss two perspectives\u2014liberation psychology and cultural psychology\u2014that have informed our approach to the topic. We then discuss manifestations of coloniality in psychological science and describe three approaches to decolonization\u2014indigenization, accompaniment, and denaturalization\u2014that emerge from contributions to the special section. We conclude with an invitation to readers to submit their own original contributions to an ongoing effort to create an online collection of digitally linked articles on the topic of decolonizing psychological science.",

It argues for a conceptualization of the asylum-migration nexus within the framework of Anibal Quijano\u2019s \u201ccoloniality of power\u201d by developing the analytical framework of the \u201ccoloniality of migration.\u201d Through the analytical framework of the \u201ccoloniality of migration\u201d the connection between racial capitalism and the asylum-migration nexus is explored. It does so by first focusing on the economic and political links between asylum and migration, and how both constitute each other. On these grounds, it discusses how asylum and migration policies produce hierarchical categories of migrants and refugees, producing a nomenclature drawing on an imaginary reminiscent of the orientalist and racialized practices of European colonialism and imperialism. In a second step, it focuses on migration and asylum policies as inherent to a logic of racialization of the workforce. It does so by first exploring the racial coding of immigration policies within the context of settler colonial-ism and transatlantic White European migration to the Am\u00e9ricas and Oceania in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and second, by discussing migration policies in post-1945 Western Europe.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, the terms \u2018decolonial\u2019 and \u2018decoloniality\u2019 have been deployed in an expansive manner and have gained increasing traction across many theoretical and political domains. Therefore, a critical assessment of the specific decolonial vocabulary is both timely and necessary. The relationship between the decolonial and the postcolonial especially requires more critical scrutiny than it has received so far. This special issue takes a step in this direction by staging critical dialogues between postcolonial and decolonial approaches on different terrains. While decolonial theory tends to operate as an expansive and centripetal force, pulling within its orbit a variety of other theoretical and political formation, our focus is on the original formulation of \u2018decoloniality\u2019 \u2013 or the \u2018decolonial option\u2019 \u2013 within the Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) group. In this introduction, we outline some of the main objections that decolonial critics have formulated against postcolonial theory, and we argue that these critiques have been instrumental in defining the decolonial option itself. While advocates of decoloniality have been very vocal in their critiques of postcolonial theory, we note among postcolonial critics \u2013 with some exceptions \u2013 a predominant tendency either not to respond to these charges or to downplay them in favour of reconciliatory moves. As an alternative to this tendency, we stress the value of a postcolonial critical response to the decolonial intervention. We argue that postcolonial theories still have something to offer to a critique of the present and the past. In the face of the decolonial claim to have radicalized or surpassed postcolonial theory, we suggest that the postcolonial must speak back and reclaim the value of its critical apparatus in the context of the unfinished struggle for decolonizing knowledge and the social unconscious of postcoloniality.",

      "abstract": "This special issue is a response to Mar\u00eda Lugones's provocative invitation to engage in a methodological move toward decolonial feminisms in the attempt to philosophize about the ways race and gender intersect and intermesh. As editors of this special issue, we believe that Lugones's challenge is especially important for those interested in liberatory philosophies, broadly, and the critical philosophy of race and feminist thought, specifically.The authors gathered here offer provocative reflections on the myriad impacts of philosopher, activist, and popular educator, Mar\u00eda Lugones. The articles included emerged from a nexus of conversations that began at the conference, \u201cTowards Decolonial Feminisms: A Conference Inspired by the work of Mar\u00eda Lugones,\u201d held at The Pennsylvania State University in 2018. In co-organizing the conference, we (the editors) and those in attendance accepted Lugones's challenge to think toward what is required to take up the demanding coalitional work of decolonial feminisms. Lugones has long called on her readers to attend to multiple worlds of sense and the importance of what she has called \u201cdeep coalitions\u201d for liberatory theory and praxis (Lugones 2003). More recently, Lugones's work has inspired renewed attention to the effects of colonization on categorizations of people according to race, gender, and sexuality. Through her analysis of what she has termed the coloniality of gender, Lugones underscores the importance of simultaneous engagement with feminist and decolonial philosophy in order to understand systems of oppression as complex interactions of powerful economic, racializing, and gendering policies and practices.We have organized this introduction into four parts. In the first part, we locate decolonial feminism more broadly within what we will call anticolonial philosophies by differentiating decolonial philosophy from postcolonial philosophy and decolonial feminism from postcolonial feminism. Second, we point to what we take to be the particular methodological commitments of decolonial feminism as articulated by Lugones. Then, we focus on Lugones's analysis of the coloniality of gender and the colonial/modern gender system in order to demonstrate how her analysis contributes to the critical philosophy of race. Third, we outline our vision for the contributions the authors make in this special issue. Specifically, we sketch out the contours of the decolonial feminist philosophies that emerge within this particular special issue. Fourth, we briefly discuss the organization of the special issue. Inspired by the centrality of the rhythms of her coalitional ethos that saturate her oeuvre as well as her affection for dancing the tango, we group the papers together with such movements in mind.There has been a great deal of theoretical work in a myriad of contexts and traditions that has at its core a critique of the histories, impacts, and experience of colonialism across the world. Though many of these dialogues span centuries, the development of work critical of the legacies and impacts of colonialism in philosophy is relatively new, particularly to the mainstream scene of the discipline. By sketching a topography in which to locate decolonial feminisms, our intent is not to produce an exhaustive or conclusive account of philosophies that are critical of colonialism. Rather, our hope is to generate distinctions that remain attentive to the particularity of specific sites, contexts, histories, and experiences of colonialism and the way these impact the workings of coloniality. Doing so allows us to draw out what we take to be the contributions made by Lugones's articulation of decolonial feminism as well as by the authors of this special issue. To do this work in the spirit of a decolonial feminist methodology, we believe that it is imperative to first check our desires for grand narratives and origin stories that neatly unpack the way in which these strands of thinking have emerged. Rather, we must feel around, engaging in the practice that Lugones calls tantear, to discover the different threads that make up the distinct patterns and textures in the weave of decolonial feminism (Lugones 2003).In our tentative topography, we situate decolonial theory within a broader body of philosophical work that we refer to as \u201canticolonial.\u201d1 We use the term as the broadest register for naming philosophical work that positions itself against systems of colonial oppression. As Breny Mendoza explains, anticolonial philosophy is a \u201ctheoretical and political project that challenges imperialist and colonizing practices, past and present\u201d (Mendoza 2015). The topography we offer also invokes the terms postcolonial and decolonial as a useful heuristic to demarcate two distinct schools and orientations to anticolonial thought.2 However, it is not sufficient to simply delineate anticolonial thinking into only two schools of thought. Despite its usefulness as a heuristic, the risk of generating such a binary is that these schools might be taken to be largely internally homogenous, to share the same assumptions and methodological approaches, as well as the same response to experiences of a monolithic conception of colonization. In order to affirm differences among schools of thought in anticolonial philosophy, we further distinguish between decolonial thinking emerging from distinct geopolitical locations and histories of struggles against colonization: for example, Africana contexts, Black American contexts, Caribbean contexts, Indigenous contexts, Latin American contexts, and U.S. Latinx contexts. Though these strands of decolonial thought mutually influence and complement each other, they are not coterminous or exhaustive of one another nor are they in and of themselves internally cohesive or noncontradictory. This is, in part, due to diverse responses to multiplicitous forms and experiences of current and ongoing practices of colonization. These practices are found in settler-colonial contexts such as the United States, as well as in the continued and lasting imprint of past forms of colonization that Quijano has described as coloniality. Indeed, each form of decolonial thinking offers its own distinct contributions to anticolonial philosophy as it outlines and prioritizes different sets of decolonial imperatives. Further, as editors, we contend that it is important to remain attentive to differences among these imperatives while also building bridges between postcolonial theory and postcolonial feminism, decolonial theory and decolonial feminism, and postcolonial feminism and decolonial feminism. This task is significant because it is only through feminist postcolonial and decolonial theory that questions of sex, gender, and sexuality are brought into each respective school's analysis of colonialism.Inspired by Edward Said's landmark text Orientalism (1978), which unveils the way colonialism relies on an imaginary that generates binary distinctions such as East/West and Colonizer/Colonized, the body of theory that Western academics refer to as \u201cpostcolonial studies\u201d tends to point to the work of those in the South Asian Subaltern Studies Group.3 However, as a school of thought, postcolonial theory is a much wider tradition that reaches far beyond this narrow context. As an intellectual tradition, postcolonial studies\u2014particularly those works influenced by the Subaltern Studies Group\u2014largely responds to the colonial practices of Northern European countries, particularly to British and French imperial/colonial projects. The continued and far-reaching influence of the analytical lens of postcolonial theory on academic discourses is undeniable. As Nivedita Majumda writes, \u201cPostcolonial theory today is viewed as an indispensable framework for understanding how power works in modern social formations and, in particular, how the West exercises its dominance over the Global South\u201d (Majumdar 2017).Postcolonial theorists' engagement with Marxism, postmodernism, and poststructuralism results in distinctive approaches to re-thinking questions of the relationship between capitalism, nationalism, globalism, and colonialism. Indeed, this theoretical background guides the innovative interventions of those like Homi Bhaba, Ranajit Guha, and Gayatri Spivak.4 Beginning from the perspective of the colonized, postcolonial scholars generate theoretical and epistemological frameworks from which to approach the specificity of the workings of capitalism and modernity in the aftermath of colonization in the so-called \u201cGlobal South.\u201d5 This is especially exemplified in the critical lexicons postcolonial scholars have generated, such as the concepts of subalternity and subaltern subjects. Some of the key claims that many postcolonial scholars hold in common include a rejection of Eurocentrism and Eurocentric paradigms of reason and representation, a critique of modernity, an emphasis on difference, and theorization of the creation of a racialized \u201csubaltern\u201d class under British and French colonial capitalism (Mendoza 2015, Mujumdar 2017).6 Resistance and the agency of the oppressed are also key themes of postcolonial theory (Mendoza 2015, Mujumdar 2017).7 However, concerns regarding the impacts of gender and sexuality were often left unexplored by the approach of the Subaltern Studies Group. It is the work of postcolonial feminist theory that most effectively presents questions of gender and sexuality as inextricable to the theoretical and political projects of postcolonial theory.The work of Gayatri Spivak has been central to academic articulations of postcolonial feminism. Despite her role as one of the founders of the Subaltern Studies Group, Spivak's insistence on gender and sexuality as primary to the critical work of postcolonial theory led to her departure (and ostracization) from this group of theorists. By foregrounding race, gender, and sexuality as inseparable from postcolonial discourses, postcolonial feminists like Spivak, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Uma Narayan, and Lila Abu-Lughod have moved away from the homogenizing tendencies of some U.S. mainstream (white, imperial) feminism in order to bring attention to the lived experiences of women in the \u201cGlobal South.\u201d8 For example, in her landmark text \u201cUnder Western Eyes\u201d Mohanty challenges the homogenizing assumptions of Western feminist discourses that construct a monolithic image of the \u201cThird World Woman\u201d as a perpetual victim. In this work, Mohanty demonstrates that the epistemic violence contained in these representations erase the political agency of women in the \u201cGlobal South.\u201d Mohanty argues that by assuming \u201cwoman as an already constituted, coherent group with identical interests and desires, regardless of class, ethnic or racial location and contradictions,\u201d Western feminist discourses falsely universalize the experience of \u201cwomanhood' as well as the functioning of patriarchy and sexual difference, regardless of cultural or historical contexts (Mohanty 1984, 336\u201337). Postcolonial feminists challenge these foundational methodological assumptions in mainstream Western feminist discourses that attempt to prove universality and cross-cultural validity on the basis of a shared experience of \u201cwomanhood.\u201d Further, postcolonial feminists challenge the colonizing model of power that undergirds the political principles that motivate these theoretical and methodological approaches.Decolonial theory, as a distinct school of anticolonial thinking, has multiple roots that span geographical and cultural contexts. Whereas postcolonial thinking tends to focus on the impact of European colonial rule around the world in the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries, decolonial thinking, particularly the body of thinking that emerges from Latin American and U.S. Latinx contexts, appeals to 1492 as a point of departure. This shift in the locus of enunciation brings a longer view of the history of colonialism into focus in order to account for Spanish and Portuguese colonization of the Americas that significantly predates British colonialism. Thus, a decolonial lens highlights the history of colonization particular to the Americas that is often occluded in postcolonial theories.This special issue focuses on decolonial philosophy emerging from Latin American and U.S. Latinx contexts. This is due in large part to a conference focused on Mar\u00eda Lugones's contributions to decolonial feminisms. As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, decolonial thinking has many strands, each marking a particular experience and reaction to colonization. Though the trauma of colonization has affective resonances across many anticolonial texts, to evoke Gloria Anzald\u00faa, we must remain attentive to the specificity of the multiple heridas abiertas/open wounds of colonialism, colonization, and coloniality in order to give greater hermeneutic context to the experiences to which decolonial theorists are responding (Anzald\u00faa 1987). Thus, we contend that it is important to be mindful of the heterogeneity within decolonial theories and the responses to multiple forms and experiences of colonization and coloniality.The work of Mar\u00eda Lugones is central to the philosophical articulation of decolonial feminism. Lugones's thinking traverses questions of identity, epistemology, and the socio-political. Her move toward a decolonial feminism emphasizes the necessity of identifying and diagnosing the workings of the coloniality of power and its collusion with our contemporary understandings of race, gender, and sexuality. Situating decolonial feminism within both feminist and decolonial traditions and utilizing the critical tools of her training in philosophy,9 Lugones's methodological approach sketches the outlines of a decolonial feminist methodology. By putting the insights of Black, Indigenous, and Latina/x feminist thinkers such as Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Audre Lorde, and Paula Gunn Allen into conversation with thinkers in the modernity/coloniality group such as An\u00edbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, and Nelson Maldonado-Torres, Lugones deepens the philosophical complexity of decolonial as well as feminist thought.Lugones's contributions to decolonial philosophy stem, in large part, from her careful accounts of the coloniality of gender. She argues that the coloniality of gender is a defining apparatus of what she has called the colonial/modern gender system.10 In order to theorize the ways in which gender is a colonial imposition, Lugones places the work of U.S. women of color on gender, race, and colonization in conversation with Quijano's framework of the coloniality of power. In so doing, Lugones aims to demonstrate the depth and breadth of social and political complicity with this racializing and gendering system of oppression. Though Lugones engages with Quijano's framework, she is critical of the way in which his account naturalizes hegemonic understandings of gender. As she contends, In Quijano's model (pattern) gender seems to be contained within the organization of that \u2018basic area of existence\u2019 that Quijano calls \u201csex, its resources, and products.\u201d That is, there is an account of gender within the framework that is not itself placed under scrutiny and that is too narrow and overly biologized as it presupposes sexual dimorphism, heterosexuality, patriarchal distribution of power, and so on. (Lugones 2007, 193) Building from Quijano's work, Lugones argues that the question of gender is central to a critical analysis of coloniality and to the project of decoloniality.In order to intervene, Lugones engages the work of Black, Indigenous, and Latina feminists to demonstrate the ways in which the colonial production of race is co-constitutive of the production of gender. Just as race was used to generate a naturalized order of inferiority to justify the violent abuse and exploitation characteristic of the processes of colonization, gender played an important role in the practices and perceptions that led to forms of sociality generated by the modern/colonial system. Far from unproblematically biological, Lugones demonstrates that the modern/colonial system ushered in a sophisticated organization of gendered relations that Lugones terms \u201cthe coloniality of gender\u201d (Lugones 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011). Engaging the work of Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Julie Greenberg, Oy\u00e9ronk\u00e9 Oyew\u00f9m\u00ed, and Paula Gunn Allen (among others), Lugones provocatively argues that \u201cgender is a modern colonial imposition\u201d (Lugones 2011, 78).Similar to her expansion of Quijano's analysis of the coloniality of power, Lugones's engagement with Mignolo's concepts of the \u201ccolonial difference\u201d and \u201cfractured locus\u201d also figure as central in her theorization of the coloniality of gender (Lugones 2007, 2010, 2011). In order to give a sense of how Lugones is building from these important concepts in Latin American decolonial philosophy, in what follows we provide a quick overview and contextualization of these terms. According to Mignolo (who is himself building on the work of Enrique Dussel and Quijano), the colonial difference is a direct consequence of the coloniality of power (Mignolo 2002). The colonial difference introduces a fracture between coloniality and modernity under the modern/colonial system. In generating this fracture, the coloniality of power establishes a cleavage between the colonized and colonizer that has philosophical, social scientific, and historical consequences. Lugones refers to this distinction as the \u201cdichotomous hierarchy between the human and nonhuman\u201d in her theorization of the coloniality of gender (Lugones 2010, 743). This distinction, that is, the colonial difference, ushers in an array of further distinctions including: rational/irrational, civilized/uncivilized, nature/culture, and man (as male)/woman (as female). Relatedly, the concept of the fractured locus of enunciation, often shortened to \u2018fractured locus,\u2019 is meant to demarcate this shift in the self-narrativization of the West. As Alejandro Vallega describes this concept in Latin American Philosophy from Identity to Radical Exteriority (2014), \u201cThe break occurs because, as Mignolo understands it, the situation from which one speaks in the colonial world system, by virtue of that very colonial history, is the site of a broken enunciation, or the 'fractured locus of enunciation'\u201d (Vallega 2014, 176). Such fracture generates possibilities for resistance.In her theorization of the coloniality of gender and her methodological move toward decolonial feminism, Lugones situates herself and her theorizing at the fractured locus of the colonial difference. In so doing, she seeks to make perceptible what had not often been perceived in Western feminism, that is, the colonial difference. Further, her account of the coloniality of gender seeks to make perceptible what had not often been perceived in decolonial theory, that is, that the colonial difference is constitutive of the category of gender itself as well as the coloniality of power. As she contends in a footnote to her important article \u201cToward a Decolonial Feminism\u201d (2010), \u201cthe coloniality of gender is constituted by and constitutive of the coloniality of power, knowledge, being, nature, and language. They are crucially inseparable\u201d (Lugones 2010, 757n8). This assertion marks a major intervention in the philosophical articulation of coloniality emerging from the Latin American context.Through her critical engagement with Quijano's concept of the coloniality of power and Mignolo's concept of the fractured locus, Lugones demonstrates why decolonial thinking must strive for decolonial futures with the firm belief that otros mundos son posibles/other worlds are possible. For Lugones, to undertake decolonial feminist work we must begin by rigorously interrogating the reach of coloniality in our everyday lives as well as any lingering attachments to it that we may have. Despite coloniality's extensive reach, Lugones maintains that the processes of colonization and the logics of coloniality are not totalizing. We believe that it is worth quoting her at length on precisely this point: [I]nstead of thinking of the global, capitalist, colonial system as in every way successful in its destruction of peoples, knowledges, relations, and economies, I want to think of the process as continually I want to think of the colonized as simply and by the colonizer and coloniality in with the colonial and the of the colonial as a to a fractured locus the of the locus are in in and the its and the of the colonized in multiple (Lugones 2010, our we are made over by the processes of colonization, because ways of and gender and sociality have in the of the and of colonization, toward and within and between worlds of sense in ways that possibilities for and of the colonial difference\u201d (Lugones calls these of that in the and of coloniality and decolonial thinkers and As they and practices the and of modernity and coloniality. an that is not by the colonial of power and knowledge, and practices us to understand that by the coloniality of power not that we of its logics and and the in this \u201cThe that we are is not the of the of the modern that worlds and and and The decolonial feminism called for by Lugones contributes to this process of the of the colonial Her emphasis on everyday lives her the to the possibilities for in the She calls for an approach that and around for and practices that the of modernity/coloniality as well as for decolonial that practice feminist of and (Lugones what it to move decolonial As Lugones underscores across multiple papers that make up her to move toward decolonial feminism not a move away from forms of liberatory theory, particularly the work of Black, Indigenous, and Latina/x Rather, in her own to move toward decolonial feminism is to move a way of that more seeks among the colonized across histories and the be and only up (Lugones 2011, That is to to move toward decolonial feminism is to out a more with the of the and myriad threads of and that have emerged from the fractured locus of this section, we outline what we take to be the contributions that the authors in this special issue make by up Lugones's invitation to move toward decolonial feminisms.

      "abstract": "The article considers the main challenges faced by the post-Soviet social sciences in the global configuration of knowledge, marked by omnipresentcoloniality. In disciplinary terms this syndrome is manifested in the social sciences/ versus area studies divide from which the post-Soviet is either excluded or equalized with postcolonial discourses. The situation can be described as a general invisibility of the post-Soviet space and its social sciences and scientists for the rest of the world and the refusal of the global North to accept the post-Soviet scholar in the capacity of a rational subject. The reasons for this complex intersection of the post-Soviet, postcolonial and other post-dependence factors are both internal and external, political and epistemic. Following the methodological principles of decolonial option the author analyses such specific elements of the post-Soviet stagnant configuration in knowledge production as the external imperial difference and the double colonial difference, the geo-politics and body-politics of knowledge the way they are reflected in the knowledge production and distribution, paying specific attention to the possible ways out of this epistemic dead-end.",

      "abstract": "Organisation and management scholars are often preoccupied with developing, refining and advancing knowledge, and in so doing, the empirical process through which knowledge is advanced can be ignored together with the impact this process can have on participants and scholars. This article draws attention to how management scholars might negotiate the complexities of positionality and representation through an illustrative case: my experience of becoming a decolonial feminist ethnographer. Drawing upon my doctoral research, I share the experience of my ethnographic journey to become a decolonial feminist ethnographer. Developing a decolonial feminist approach to ethnography enabled me to identify positionality and representation as the key complexities of engaging in research with marginalised \u2018Others\u2019 while also providing me with the tools to address these complexities. This is not to say that becoming a decolonial feminist ethnographer is the only way to engage in research with marginalised \u2018Others\u2019, but this critical approach encourages researcher reflexivity and helps in addressing the issues of positionality and representation. My approach suggests an alternative way of \u2018seeing and doing\u2019 ethnography motivated by an ethical commitment to the participants and the desire to respect their knowledge and experiences.",

Such an unconventional understanding of the terms \"postcolonial\" and \"decolonial\" allows to transcend the long-going rivalry and geopolitical divisions between the postcolonial studies and the decolonial option through the medium of the post-socialist and post-dependence optics and discourses. The post-socialist intervention launches a number of concepts necessary for the analysis of the post-socialist/postcolonial intersections. Among them, the imperial difference; the geopolitics and corpopolitics of knowledge, being, gender, and sensing; decolonial aesthesis; and the reversal of temporal directions in the post-Soviet context. Postcolonial discourse needs to be contextualized and eventually radicalized. It means a shift from the explanation of the other in the language understandable by the same to delinking from the rhetoric of modernity with its hidden colonial logic and tracing other genealogies of knowledge and activism and other ways of interpreting modernity/coloniality.",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes 1. The concept of the coloniality of power was theorized by the Peruvian sociologist An\u00edbal Quijano. He argues that modern regimes of power are characterized by what he terms \u2018coloniality\u2019, which, as distinct from colonialism, is not simply defined by a formal redomination between empire and colony but primarily defined by global and national/cultural hierarchies (gendered, racialized, and sexualized) that are articulated differentially in time and space. See Quijano's (Citation1992, Citation2000). See also Mignolo (Citation2000), Lao-Montes (Citation2001), and Grosfoguel (2002). 2. For a discussion of the twinned logics of US empire (as a spatial territory) and as the cultures of US new imperialism (as a deterritorialized logic of capitalism), see Harvey (Citation2003). 3. See Althusser (Citation1971) and Butler (Citation1997). 4. See The Nature and Context of Minority Discourse (1990). 5. Deleuze & Guattari (1986). 6. See my \u2018Foreword\u2019 (2001), (2000a and b, 1996). 7. The postpositivist realism the Reclaiming Identity scholars defend emerges from within the philosophy of science, and is informed by the work of Charles Sanders Pierce, W.V.O. Quine, and Hilary Putnam, among others. I have profited from Putnam's autobiographical essay on the philosophy of science entitled \u2018A Half Century of Philosophy, Viewed From Within\u2019 (Citation1997). 8. Mohanty hypothesizes in Literary Theory and the Claims of History: \u2018instead of conceiving identities as self-evidently based on the authentic experiences of members of a cultural or social group, \u2026 or as all equally unreal to the extent that they lay any claim to the real experiences of real people because experience is a radically mystifying term, \u2026 we need to explore the possibility of a theoretical understanding of social and cultural identity in terms of objective social location. To do so, we need a cognitivist conception of experience \u2026\u2019 (1997, p. 216). 9. Brown (Citation1995). 10. As I have suggested above, the coloniality of power functions to organize cross-genealogical dialogues and theoretical developments around issues central to the futures of minority studies: identity, subjectification, power regimes, espistemology, and transformative politics. Among the scholars engaged in those dialogues are An\u00edbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, Agust\u00edn Lao-Montes, Ram\u00f3n Grosfoguel, Enrique Dussel, Catherine Walsh, and Freya Schiwy. 11. For far-reaching studies of the emerging problems in the intellectual and institutional organization of academic thinking, see Walllerstein et al. (Citation1996) and Mignolo (Citation2000). While the Wallersteinian Gulbenkian Commission's report is a highly analytical narrative of the social sciences over the past 100 years, and gracefully uses world system theory, chaos and dynamical complexity theory, contingent universalism, and a timely call for ethnoracial and gender diversity in the academy to overturn Max Weber's worn out call for a \u2018disenchantment with the world\u2019, Mignolo's study of the historical humanities in the modern world colonial system can be read as an exemplary corrective to the Gulbenkian Commission's call for universalizing the social sciences. Mignolo argues that the Gulbenkian Commission's position on universalism ends up subalternizing others. Briefly, the issue for Mignolo is not how to universalize the social sciences or the historical humanities, but how to better locate the \u2018colonial difference'embedded in our academic cultures of scholarship. Mignolo inists that we need to think in terms of local US Latino/a and global border knowledge (gnosis) rather than in terms of the disciplines. 12. For an understanding of how nineteenth-century America was obsessed about vernacular varieties of English, see Jones (Citation1999). 13. Nepantla is a word used by a Nahuatl-speaking people in the sixteenth century to define their own socio-cultural situation in the face of the Spanish conquest. As Walter Mignolo suggests, the word, nepantla, was recorded by Diego Dur\u00e1n, a Dominican missionary who was writing an ethnographic history of the Nahuatl speakers from the Valley of Mexico. When Dur\u00e1n asked one of his informants what he thought about the difficult situation that had been created for them by the Spanish invasion, the informant is reported to have responded \u2018estamos nepantla\u2019, (\u2018we are Nepantla\u2019), that is, \u2018we are in-between\u2019. Personal correspondence with the author, 15 January 1998. My emphasis on nepantla throughout the essay is meant to function as a reminder of the \u2018colonial difference\u2019 implicit in US Latino/a Studies, a translational and transnational memory that all cultural difference has to be seen in the context of power and of the relations of subalternity and domination. 14. Gloria Anzald\u00faa writes in \u2018Border Arte: Nepantla, El lugar de la Frontera\u2019, that border art \u2018depicts both the soul of the artist and the soul of the pueblo. It deals with who tells the stories and what stories and histories are told. I call this form of visual narrative autohistorias. This form goes beyond the traditional self-portrait or autobiography, in telling the writer/artist's personal story, it also includes the artist's cultural history\u2019 (p. 113). In a conversation with me at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on 17 October 1990, Anzald\u00faa described the form of Borderlands/La Frontera with the homegrown neologism, autohistoriteor\u00eda. 15. Anzald\u00faa's imaginative work has had the great fortune of having been treated by superb feminist and postcolonial critics. In addition to Mignolo, Sald\u00edvar-Hull, Sandoval,Yarbro- Bejarano, and Chabram-Dernesesian's work, readers can track an emerging debate in Chicana/o Studies between psychoanalytic and deconstructive work such as Norma Alarcon's and post-postivist realist work such as Paula Moya's. For Alarc\u00f3n, Anzald\u00faa's \u2018lesbo-erotic\u2019 text not only \u2018recodifies the multiple names of Woman\u2019 and recuperates \u2018a new mestiza consciousness\u2019, but also resituates Coatlicue through the author's own \u2018nonconscious memory\u2019 (p. 50). Briefly, for Alarc\u00f3n, Anzald\u00faa represents \u2018the non-(pre)-oedipal mother\u2019 in Borderlands/La Frontera and in the process \u2018gives birth to herself as inscriber/speaker of/for mestiza consciousness\u2019 (p. 50). More recently, Paula Moya in Learning from Experience, has responded to Alarc\u00f3n's and Chela Sandoval's reading of Anzald\u00faa by suggesting that in Alarc\u00f3n's and Sandoval's proto-poststructuralist approaches to Chicana feminism in general and Anzald\u00faa's work in particular, they have \u2018run the risk of theorizing \u2026 identity in terms of ambiguity and fragmentation so that the \u2018Chicana\u2019 becomes, in effect, a figure for marginality and contradiction in the postmodern world. I would argue that the term \u2018Chicana\u2019 should not denote a principle of abstract oppositionality\u2019 (p. 129). In contradistinction to Alarc\u00f3n's and Sandoval's readings, Moya calls for a post-positivist realist approach to Anzald\u00faa's work based on issues of identity and experience. Thus envisaged, Anzald\u00faa's new mestiza consciousness for Moya can be interpreted as a form of \u2018epistemic privilege\u2019, that is, \u2018a special advantage with respect to possessing or acquiring knowledge about how fundamental aspects of our society \u2026 operate to sustain matrices of power\u2019 (p. 188, fn. 36). While this is not the place to respond to this debate in Chicano/a Studies, I would like to note that Anzald\u00faa's work engages us with another \u2018take\u2019 on the \u2018post\u2019, that is, what we might call, the \u2018post-human\u2019. Throughout Borderlands/La Frontera, Anzald\u00faa asks an urgent question: how do we go about breaking down the barriers we pose between the human and the animal? In contradistinction to Weber and Descartes, Anzald\u00faa calls for a \u2018reenchantment with the world\u2019. Specifically, her \u2018alien\u2019 allegory builds on passages such as the following one in her autohistoriateor\u00eda: \u2018I tremble before the animal, the alien, sub-or suprahuman, the one that has something in common with the wind and the trees, \u2026 that possesses a demon determination and ruthlessness beyond the human\u2019 (p. 72, my emphasis). 16. I would like to thank my Berkeley colleague, Gautam Premnath for allowing me to read his superb dissertation entitled \u2018Arguments with Nationalism in the Fiction of the Indian Diaspora\u2019, which he completed at Brown University in 2003. I am especially indebted to Premnath's powerful suggestion that Arhundhati Roy politically declares herself and her characters to be \u2018mobile republics\u2019 in order to get at the fundamental failure of the Indian republic to come into its own. I read Premnath's work after I had completed the writing of this last section of the essay, and after I had formulated my arguments that Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things fundamentally critiques postcolonial coloniality and nationalism through her dystopian deconstruction of kinship in Kerala and alternatively uses the erotic as a utopian form of political and cultural critique. 17. Here in this last section, it should become clear that I am in substantial agreement with Satya P. Mohanty that our identities are not mere social constructions and hence \u2018spurious\u2019, nor fixed unchanging essences in a brutalizing world. I agree, further, with Mohanty that \u2018we have the capacity to examine our social identities, considering them in light of our best understanding of other social facts and our other social relationships\u2019 (1997, p. 201). My reading of Roy's The God of Small Things is indebted to what I take to be Mohanty's significant reformulation of experience and identity dispersed throughout his Literary Theory and the Claims of History (1997). 18. I read Roy's critique of the bourgeois nation in The God of Small Things as echoing Ranajit Guha's description of the South Asian Subaltern Group's project. In his essay, \u2018On Some Aspects of the Historiography of Colonial India\u2019 (1988), Guha defines the problematic of their project as \u2018the study of [the] historical failure of the nation to come into its own, a failure due to the inadequacy of the bourgeoisie as well as of the working class to lead it to a decisive victory over colonialism and a bourgeois-democratic revolution of either the classic nineteenth-century type under the hegemony of the bourgeoisie or a more modern type under the hegemony of workers and peasants, that is a \u201cnew democracy\u201d\u2019, p. 43. 19. I refer, of course, to the term Orlando Patterson in Slavery and Social Death (Citation1982) gives to the status of being a living being radically deprived of all rights. 20. See Dominick LaCapra's \u2018Representing the Holocaust: Reflections on the Historians\u2019 Debate\u2019 (1992). 21. My reading of kinship and positionality has profited from Judith Butler's Antigone's Claim: Kinship Between Life and Death (2000).",

Critiques and counter-projects that draw inspiration from Latin American decolonial thinking have become an increasingly prominent part of this, particularly in the past few years. In this article, I offer an assessment of this nascent decolonial IR. I make two broad arguments: that dominant modes of decolonial critique in IR need to be supplemented by projects that unravel-that is, make sense of and disrupt-racialized power and knowledge relations as they play out across multiple political, economic, and epistemic sites; and that achieving this requires more nuanced and targeted decolonial methodologies than those that are currently available. This leads me to reframe coloniality in IR as a methodological problem, not to supplant questions of epistemology, ontology, or ethics in decolonial IR but to render them more amenable to empirical analysis. Illustrating my discussion through reference to the global governance of \"traditional knowledge,\" I sketch out a methodological framework for decolonial IR that is attentive to the slow, context-specific processes through which coloniality (re)emerges but is also reshaped.",

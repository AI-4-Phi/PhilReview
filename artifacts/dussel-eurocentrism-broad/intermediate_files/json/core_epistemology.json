      "abstract": "This paper critically explores decolonial theory and its relevance for tourism studies. We suggest that while postcolonial and related critical theoretical perspectives furthered understandings of the consequences of colonisation, such critical theorising has not provided an epistemological perspective of tourism which legitimises the cosmologies of, and actively empowers, traditionally marginalised groupings. We review published tourism research which adopts critical and postcolonial perspectives, and argue that while these have been valuable in terms of exposing the existence and effects of dominant discourses and practices in tourism, their emancipatory objectives are limited because tourism knowledge is still predominantly colonial. Epistemological decolonisation is thus presented as a more radical project which can provide an \u2018other\u2019 way of thinking, being and knowing about tourism.\n\nKeywords: colonial; decolonisation; decolonial theory; de-linking; epistemological; postcolonia",

      "abstract": "In political, scholarly and cultural discussions in the \u2018Global North\u2019, ideas of freedom, democracy and human rights were considered universal and legitimated for political and military interventions mostly in non-Western countries. Debates about the universality of the right to intervene are discussed in the frame of universality versus particularity. Whereas universalists defend their arguments in the name of modernity, their challengers opposed to these kinds of universal assumptions refer to the importance of particularism\r\nand relativism; yet, both groups consider modernity as their main point of reference. To overcome this stalled discussion, I look at modernity through the deconstruction of epistemic dichotomies and hierarchies in order to open up a space for critical reflection on the concept itself. Contextualizing my reflections on modernity in the rich literature by scholars who challenge the dominant Western concept of modernity, I demonstrate that Western knowledge is not universal in an epistemic sense. Rather, it can be considered as a contentious concept with problematic assumptions about an epistemically\r\nneutral subject, adopting a universalistic perspective while erasing the meaning of geopolitical location (Grosfoguel 2011). Arguing against this idea of an \u2018assertive universality\u2019, the metaphor of \u2019travelling theories,\u2019 as proposed by Edward Said\r\nand Clifford Geertz, helps to reflect upon the local, social and individual positioning of knowledge. The focus of this contribution is the utilisation of feminist and postcolonial perspectives to contribute to the deconstruction of modernity as a homogenous monolithic bloc. Considering the frame itself, I question the hidden, not explicated assumptions in the production of Western knowledge. Arguing that knowledge\r\nproduction is not a question of geography but of epistemology, I deconstruct the modern project from the inside in order to overcome the epistemic dichotomy of modernity itself. The implications of this analysis for us as social scientists and researchers will be discussed at the end of the paper.peer-reviewe",

      "abstract": "Colonialism has ended, but the structure of colonial power persists, and education is a key vehicle for the colonization of the mind. Following the research of the Latin America collective project modernidad/ colonialidad, this paper analyzes the continuous reproduction of colonial power in European programs on education and training as well as in the production of educational knowledge. The neoliberal impact of European politics affects societies in and outside of Europe and intensifies a hegemonic struggle over educational knowledge production, educational studies, and the humanities. The complex praxis of what I call the \u2018epistemic community Europe\u2019 articulates the hegemonic and colonial power. I, then, take a closer look at the elements of this epistemic community and discuss two of them in detail: the \u2018scientification\u2019 of politics and the relevance of the human capital approach. The neoliberal turn of European governance produces standardized educational knowledge and, simultaneously, \u2018absences.\u2019 Resistance emerges from absent experiences and knowledges, which open the field for decolonial options.Nach dem Ende des Kolonialismus existieren koloniale Strukturen und Denkmuster weiter, und Erziehung und Bildung tragen wesentlich zu ihrer Reproduktion bei. In diesem Artikel werden im Anschluss an Forschungen des kollektiven lateinamerikanischen Projekts modernidad/ colonialidad Programme der europ\u00e4ischen Politik zu Erziehung und Training sowie zur Offenen Methode der Koordinierung auf hegemoniale und koloniale Strukturen untersucht. In einem ersten Schritt beschreibe ich die Governance-Praktiken als epistemic community Europe. In einem zweiten Schritt analysiere ich zwei Elemente dieser epistemic community genauer: die \u201aVerwissenschaftlichung\u2018 der Politik und die Bedeutung des Humankapitalansatzes. Die neoliberale Politik der Europ\u00e4ischen Union produziert zusammen mit transnationalen Organisationen wie der OECD nicht nur standardisiertes Wissen \u00fcber Bildung und Erziehung, sondern sie produziert damit auch sogenannte \u201aAbwesenheiten\u2018 und erzeugt damit Alternativlosigkeit.

Given this assumption, three recurring perplexities- of territoriality, parochiality-imperiality and coloniality \u2013 appear to preoccupy much critical thinking on the subject. I suggest a different reason underpins the invention and operation of Human Rights. I argue that Human Rights, as a (post)colonial technology of subjectification, operates in perverse coherence, to rationalize and regulate the global (b)ordering of differentiated subject-beingness: of license, containment and abandonment. As such efforts that aim to rescue Human Rights for the human-subject merely reinforce the adaptive operations of global governmentality to norm-alise and resettle the World. Against this I suggest a return to an anti-colonial philosophical orientation of desubjectification",

      "abstract": "This paper discusses selected dispositions and characteristics of the modern liberal/Cartesian subject observed in students\u2019 responses to a survey on internationalization of higher education in Canada. The data on which this paper draws is part of a larger database of surveys, interviews, policy analyses and case studies that were developed within the framework of the Ethical Internationalization in Higher Education (EIHE) research project. The EIHE project was funded by the Finnish Academy of Science and was conducted between 2012-2016. This paper draws on three key findings from the responses of students (1451) of seven participating Canadian universities to present a broader (theoretical) context that could be inferred from what was observed in the data. For this purpose the paper first discusses some of the theories related to the existence and prevalence of the modern global imaginary that could be considered as a meta-framework under which such relations between the (modern) subject and his/her Other are normalized. In the next step it draws on psychoanalytical strands of decolonial and postcolonial critiques of the modern subject in an attempt to sketch some of problematic (and often unacknowledged) characteristics of the modern liberal/Cartesian subject that lead to constant re-production of binary hierarchical relations grounded on epistemic violence and privilege.peer-reviewe",

Approaching this question with regard to Pakistan and Afghanistan opens a series of conceptual questions that\n\nare useful beyond these cases. Above all, we contend that support to marginal specializations, particularly in service of making them less marginal, must involve an openness to the world beyond professional academic life. By this, we first mean an openness to different purposes for knowledge that are related to political and social stakes in countries other than India. Second, we suggest the need for a greater openness to different sources and forms of knowledge than have traditionally been admitted into academic conversation in the global north",

First, I return to Heidegger\u2019s theorisation of \u2018planetary technicity\u2019 as the ontology of modernity, arguing, with Heidegger, that in order to respond to this problem we must return to the question of Being. From here, I link Heidegger\u2019s theory of technicity with the work of decolonial theory on the \u2018coloniality of Being\u2019, suggesting that one reason for Heidegger\u2019s pessimism is that he did not think technicity from beyond a Eurocentric perspective. The recent \u2018ontological turn\u2019 in decolonial anthropology that seeks to study Indigenous thought as ontology, however, shows that there are resources for thinking beyond the onto-logic of technicity. Yet, here, I return to Irigaray\u2019s critique of Heidegger for his forgetting of sexuate difference in his analysis of technology to say that a move to a decolonial ontology beyond planetary technicity can only take place if we go through an ontology of sexual difference: because, as Irigaray shows, the onto-logic of technicity that underwrites coloniality and modernity begins in an ontological annihilation of life, sexuate difference, and the maternal debt, the only way to recover this is by thinking the question of sexuate difference. Finally, I conclude by examining the case of the Kogi peoples of Colombia who have warned Westerners that the destruction of the planet can only be stopped if we learn to recompense our common Mother. This case, I suggest, shows how and why the turn to non-Western ontologies as a way out of the death project of modern technicity must reckon with the work of Irigaray",

I focus on works that help conceptualize history beyond issues of political economy. Some locate themselves solely in the Anglophone academy, but this is not intended as a complete survey of their field. Rather, I place those works in dialogue with, and prioritize, eclectic histories that are both \u2018about\u2019 and \u2018of\u2019 the borderland; and I discuss this combined field with reference to other scholarly work on \u2018thinking from borders\u2019 in both the political-economic and intellectual-cultural senses. My goal is to intervene in the second set of borders, to disrupt boundaries between global academic culture and \u2018other\u2019 intellectual milieus. Taking tazkiras and autobiographies as examples, I argue that genres of writing from regions heavily fragmented by imperial bordering, among other factors, are social theory in action, not just representation for historians to appropriate. Engaging border history genres and taking seriously the insight they offer requires a willingness to engage the webs of social commitments that produced these works: to work in contribution to their milieus rather than merely writing about them",

      "abstract": "This paper analyses the tension between the double focus on critique and alterity within decolonial discourses. We argue that an excess of critical thinking could lead to scepticism, whereas an overemphasis on alterity could result in dogmatism. Consequently, since both approaches end up obstructing epistemic decolonization, we argue that it is necessary to strike a balance between critique and alterity; a balance that does not resolve the tension, but seeks to reveal its underlying relation. The first section locates decolonial theory within the framework of critical theory. We highlight how Quijano, Dussel and Mignolo invoke the critical tradition, whilst simultaneously claiming that a radical departure from it is necessary. Turning more explicitly to Dussel in Section 2, we explain Dussel's analectics as a method to localize discourses, in which globally excluded perspectives are foregrounded. In the third section, we defend Dussel's universalism and rationalism against criticisms from Castro-G\u00f3mez and Vallega by interpreting him as a relational thinker. Ultimately, the paper concludes that the success of epistemic decolonization hinges on its ability to reconcile classic notions of universality and rationality in a manner that avoids dogmatism and scepticism, namely by a continual grounding of philosophical discourse in material life.</p",

Focusing on the role of grief in recent prorefugee activism in Europe, this article argues that these ethical perspectives contribute to an ideological formation that disconnects connected histories and that turns questions of responsibility, guilt, restitution, repentance, and structural reform into matters of empathy, generosity, and hospitality. The result is a veil of ignorance which, while not precisely Rawlsian, allows the European subject to re-constitute itself as \u201cethical\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d, innocent of its imperialist histories and present complicities",

      "abstract": "This article makes explicit a hidden tension between post-Marxism and decolonial studies, which points to a challenge for intercultural dialogue. While post-Marxism seeks to rehabilitate a universal foundation for the construction of truth claims\u2014a universal already formed within Western modernity\u2014the decolonial critique seeks to dismantle all universals connected to the myths of modernity and therefore demands a departure from the standpoint of the cultural periphery. In fact, Alain Badiou and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, like other post-Marxists, have been rather critical of the standpoints articulated by decolonialists who strive to include cultural differences and marginalised identities in the process of knowledge production, but the reality is that the decolonial critique, more so than post-Marxism, is well-supported by the historical evidence, thus demonstrating the need for Enrique Dussel calls a \u2018transmodern pluriverse\u2019 in the academic world. In pursuit of diffusing this tension between the post-Marxists and the decolonialists, this article calls for further investigation in terms of determining if real dialogue is possible between these two trajectories of thought",

      "abstract": "This thesis opens up theoretical pathways for decolonial epistemologies for energy planning in Brazil. The critical analysis is verticalized from the 2015\u20132024 Brazilian Decennial Energy Expansion Plan (DEEP) to better highlight the epistemological problems in energy planning. Epistemological challenges demand a critical understanding of the ethical system we live in \u2013 the ethics of exhaustion \u2013 to enable a comprehensive radical transformation of the consideration of energy futures, since epistemology is part of the formalization of ethics. This thesis argues that energy planning in Brazil is based on the ethics of exhaustion to epistemically impose the colonial agenda of power. Energy futures are planned as necessary harm to achieve the fetishized good, normalized as the ethical intersubjective and human\u2013environment relationships. Critically analysing the ethical system enables understanding the epistemologies for energy planning in Brazil as the formal moment of the ethics of exhaustion, which can only be challenged in an intersectional manner by framing the multilateral and collateral aspects of the violence consistent in planning energy futures regardless and to the detriment of the existence of life. Epistemic diversity is the first step towards decolonizing energy planning. It comprises: the inclusion of indigenous and communal perspectives when elaborating the energy plans; having persons directly affected by energy enterprises as the majority of the personnel involved in the activity of planning; setting the priority of energy planning as the production and reproduction of all lives in a non-hierarchized manner; recognizing the necessary balance in the human\u2013environment relationship; privileging local needs in relation to transnational markets; and intentionally de-hierarchizing the benefits of energy exploitation by delinking energy studies, production, and distribution from financial capital. This work challenges colonial epistemologies, based on the ethics of exhaustion, from the standpoint of the colonial difference, proposing epistemic diversity as the impulse for decolonial energy planning in Brazil. It is an urgent academic task to perceive epistemic decolonization to transform the present in order to stop condemning the future to social and environmental catastrophes",

In distinction from the Christian, Religious, and racialized understandings of the blues, this dissertation focuses on the space in which the blues emerges, the Delta Region of the United States. By attending to space, this dissertation shows how critical consideration of geography and region can reveal nuances that are often veiled behind racialized and theologized ways of understanding the people of the Delta Region. Reading the blues in space discloses the ways in which the blues dislocates the confines of interpreters that label it a racialized phenomenon on one hand, and  the devil\\u27s music  on the other. By wresting the blues from colonialist and racist logics, this dissertation contends that the space that produces the blues can be recovered as a viable resource for reimagining a theology of revelation",

      "abstract": "Epistemology and Domination: Problems with the Coloniality of Knowledge Thesis in Latin American Decolonial Theory Latin American decolonial theory is built around the thesis of the \u201ccoloniality of knowledge\u201d, which claims that the socio-political domination of Latin America and other regions of the global periphery by European countries and the United States is directly related to the initial colonial imposition and subsequent cultural reproduction of so-called \u201cWestern epistemology\u201d and science. I argue that the epistemological claims of four decolonial thinkers (An\u00edbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, Enrique Dussel, Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez) that make up the coloniality of knowledge thesis are problematic for several reasons: they are based on distorted and simplistic readings of Descartes, Hume and other Enlightenment figures; they make contentious generalizations about so-called Western epistemology; and they ultimately lead to epistemic relativism, which is a problematic basis for the social sciences and, contrary to decolonial aspirations, renders the subaltern unable to speak.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article provides a Latin American feminist critique of early decolonial theories focusing on the work of An\u00edbal Quijano and Enrique Dussel. Although decolonial theorists refer to Chicana feminist scholarship in their work, the work of Latin American feminists is ignored. However, the author argues that Chicana feminist theory cannot stand in for Latin American feminist theory because \u201clo latinoamericano\u201d gets lost in translation. Latin American feminists must do their own theoretical work. Central to the critique of the use of gender in decolonial theory is an analysis of the social pacts among white capitalists and white working-class men that not only exclude white women but make citizenship and democracy impossible for men and women of color in the metropolis as well as in the colony. By revealing the nexus between gender, race, and democracy, not only is the coloniality of gender apparent, but also the coloniality of democracy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper analyses the tension between the double focus on critique and alterity within decolonial discourses. We argue that an excess of critical thinking could lead to scepticism, whereas an overemphasis on alterity could result in dogmatism. Consequently, since both approaches end up obstructing epistemic decolonization, we argue that it is necessary to strike a balance between critique and alterity; a balance that does not resolve the tension, but seeks to reveal its underlying relation. The first section locates decolonial theory within the framework of critical theory. We highlight how Quijano, Dussel and Mignolo invoke the critical tradition, whilst simultaneously claiming that a radical departure from it is necessary. Turning more explicitly to Dussel in Section 2, we explain Dussel\u2019s analectics as a method to localize discourses, in which globally excluded perspectives are foregrounded. In the third section, we defend Dussel\u2019s universalism and rationalism against criticisms from Castro-G\u00f3mez and Vallega by interpreting him as a relational thinker. Ultimately, the paper concludes that the success of epistemic decolonization hinges on its ability to reconcile classic notions of universality and rationality in a manner that avoids dogmatism and scepticism, namely by a continual grounding of philosophical discourse in material life.",

These mechanisms operating in society persist today, promoting above all the subalternity of bodies-territories, cultures, and knowledge, including mathematical ones. This theoretical paper is part of an ongoing thesis, and aims at answering the following concern: how can the multiple knowledges circumscribed in the cultural manifestation of Zambiapunga be used to reformulate the hegemonic model still present in teaching and learning processes? The objective is to reflect on Zambiapunga as a cultural instrument in service of a Decolonial Education in the classroom. This is a qualitative, bibliographic investigation that identifies Zambiapunga as a candidate to materialize an alternative cultural reference in support of a multi-referenced education which inspires a multicultural curriculum. As a result, vast possibilities were found for using this Afro-diasporic cultural manifestation in the service of a Decolonial Education, especially through different rationalities, memories, musicality, identities, memories, languages, histories, values and customs that were made invisible in the context of coloniality.",

It suggests that such religiosity interrupts normalised notions of Christianity that have further marginalised the oppressed women, as the lived religiosity of the devad\u0101s\u012bs acts as a challenge to Eurocentric theology and mission that has systematised \u2018the poor\u2019 into deserving and undeserving based upon dichotomous notions of decency.

We conducted bibliographic and documental research. Comparative Education has a pragmatic use and the way the Reforms were and still are being implemented does not consider the local specificities of each region. The main conclusion is that the Decolonial Theory gives subsidies for an epistemological turn in the field of Comparative Education with an emphasis on educational reforms in order to (re)think the articulation between the tension of the local and the global.",

Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

Each episteme produced sedimentations, geo-cultural accumulations and institutional condensations in the health field, in academia, in the States, and in the societies as a whole throughout the 20th century.",

Nesse aspecto, o artigo se insere nas discussoes epistemologicas escolhendo como tema a epistemologia social e o pensamento decolonial. O objetivo deste artigo e identificar as possiveis convergencias entre o pensamento decolonial e a epistemologia social e, a partir disso, propor, de forma ensaistica, uma epistemologia social decolonial. No aspecto metodologico, trata-se de pesquisa exploratoria, qualitativa e bibliografica. O procedimento tecnico para as analises da bibliografia se deu mediante abordagem nao probabilistica, por julgamento. O principal resultado deste artigo e a construcao de um panorama historico e epistemologico que viabiliza a aproximacao de tematicas que, embora produzidas em contextos e interesses distintos, convergem em objetivo comum: constituir um campo epistemico social, democratico e que nao desconsidere os diversos sujeitos do conhecimento. Assim, as reflexoes que aliam a proposta de uma epistemologia social ao pensamento ou movimento decolonial podem aproximar vertentes e perspectivas teoricas a pratica profissional e a pesquisas voltadas ao contexto informacional do seculo XXI.",

      "abstract": "\n According to a recent move in social epistemology, certain types of epistemic wrongs require distinctively epistemic reparations. For instance, if you have been wrongfully convicted of murder, you have not only the right to various kinds of economic and social reparations but also the \u2018right to be known\u2019 (Lackey 2022) \u2013 crudely, the right to tell the true story about yourself and be listened to. In this paper, I extend this framework to the context of epistemic decolonisation. I argue that the key decolonial epistemic reparations are reparations for the undermined epistemic authority of the colonised. I call these \u2018decolonial epistemic authority reparations\u2019 and develop five constraints on a plausible account of them. If the argument is compelling, it will advance both the epistemic reparations framework (which does not talk to the decolonisation literature at present) and the project of epistemic decolonisation (which does not yet canvass epistemic reparations).",

We have not worked with the breadth and depth of decoloniality in education. It is necessary to decolonize the categorical system of pedagogy, curriculum, and didactics. It is urgent to make a decolonial reading of the genealogy of educational sciences. Looking at pedagogy, curriculum, and didactics from a decolonial viewpoint will allow us to uncover the Eurocentric nature of the categorical system of these theories of education and teaching. We must de-link Educational Sciences from Eurocentricity and reveal the doctrinality of education and training, the process that pedagogy hides in its proposal for the notion of training as well as the contradiction between training and emancipation. Doctrinality is the hidden side of the training.",

      "abstract": "Frankfurt School methodology involves a lasting commitment to immanent critique. What distinguishes immanent critique from other forms of social criticism, scholars in this tradition argue, is that social practices are to be judged according to norms and potentials already contained within their objects. This article considers critical theory's relationship to coloniality by developing a three\u2010part challenge to the practice of immanent critique, drawing on insights of decolonial philosophers Anibal Quijano, Enrique Dussel, Maria Lugones, and Oy\u00e8r\u00f3nk\u1eb9\u0301 Oy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed. Immanent critics, I conclude, risk being inattentive to constitutive exclusions, reinscribing asymmetrical burdens on certain critics, and unwittingly replaying a mechanism of domination familiar from colonialism in and through their preferred method of critique. Accordingly, I argue that immanent critics should attend to relations of power that govern the practice of critique itself and offer reasons for being more pluralistic about our methods of criticism.",

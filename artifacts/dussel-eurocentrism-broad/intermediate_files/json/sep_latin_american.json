        "In its most expansive sense, Latin American philosophy is philosophy produced in Latin America or philosophy produced by persons of Latin American ancestry who reside outside of Latin America. It is typically taken to exclude philosophy produced in non-Iberian former colonies, with the occasional exception of former French colonies in the Caribbean.",
        "The first two refer specifically to the philosophy of former Spanish colonies, the third to that of former Iberian colonies, and the fourth to the philosophy produced in the United States by descendants of Latin Americans.",
        "Recently, there has been an effort on the part of historians to include pre-Columbian thought in Latin American philosophy, although the pre-Columbian texts cited are often fragmentary and religious in tone and intention. In terms of traditions, style, and influence, post-Columbian Latin American philosophy is part of the Western philosophical tradition.",
        "Indeed, philosophical discussions in Latin America have and continue to be dominated by European philosophical influences. Even those Latin American philosophers who have endeavored to develop original theories have frequently framed their own contributions in the terms of European thinkers."

      "snippet": "The nature of philosophy in Latin America first drew the attention of philosophically-minded thinkers in the early nineteenth century, when the region began to develop into nations independent from Spain. But it acquired greater significance with the birth of contemporary academic philosophy in the following century, ultimately taking center stage in Latin American philosophy during the second half of the 20th century, where we still find it today.",

        "A salient feature of Latin American philosophy is its early engagement in reflection about its nature and significance\u2014indeed, its quality and the very possibility of its existence. The result of this reflection has been substantial debates about issues that are of interest to Latin American philosophy as well as metaphilosophy in general.",
        "The nature of philosophy in Latin America first drew the attention of philosophically-minded thinkers in the early nineteenth century, when the region began to develop into nations independent from Spain. But it acquired greater significance with the birth of contemporary academic philosophy in the following century, ultimately taking center stage in Latin American philosophy during the second half of the 20th century, where we still find it today.",
        "Often motivated by discomfort with mainstream conceptions of philosophy, inquiry into the nature of Latin American philosophy has involved a number of sub-questions about its existence, originality, authenticity, significance, and role in culture and society.",
        "The search for answers has led to normative questions about what Latin American philosophy should be, as a practice, and as an academic discipline. Thus many Latin American philosophers are concerned with questions of metaphilosophy (understood as in Williamson 2007)."

        "For example, anthropologist Bonfil Batalla (1996) has argued that important aspects of an indigenous worldview have persisted into the lived experience of modern Mexicans. Moreover, religious syncretism is a long-standing feature of Catholicism in Latin America."

        "Latinx philosophy is philosophical work substantively concerned with Latinxs, including the moral, social, political, epistemic, and linguistic significance of Latinxs and their experiences.[1] Although its emergence as a distinctive, self-identified field is relatively recent, Latinx philosophy includes a substantial body of work that draws from a variety of philosophical traditions, including critical race theory, Latina feminist philosophy, Latinx and Chicanx Studies, various strands of Latin American, Continental, analytic, Caribbean, and Africana philosophy.",
        "A recurring issue within Latinx philosophy is the characterization of Latinxs. US and Latin American social identity categories are oftentimes distinct, and products of different racial and social categories.",
        "Another notable interest for some philosophers working within Latinx philosophy has been the expansion of what figures are canonical for philosophy, and in particular, for Latinx philosophy, or more specifically, a Mexican American philosophy. Orosco (2016b) has argued that important figures in the Chicano Civil Rights movement\u2014Cesar Chavez and Armando Rendon, among others\u2014ought to count as philosophers.",
        "In a different direction, Carlos S\u00e1nchez\u2019s work in the history of Mexican philosophy\u2014including translations and discussions of Mexican existentialism (2012, 2016)\u2014has been animated by the goal of expanding the philosophical canon in ways that might helpfully speak to contemporary Mexican American people and their circumstances (see the introduction and conclusion of Sanchez 2016). Surveying the state of contemporary work in Latinx philosophy suggests an initial taxonomy of the field."

This entry describes the historical development of analytic philosophy in Latin America and offers some examples of original contributions by Latin American analytic philosophers.",
        "This entry gives an overview of analytic philosophy produced in Latin America, not about Latin America. It covers philosophical developments concerning diverse and universal problems that are at the heart of Western philosophy. It focuses on philosophers who have developed a large part of their research and teaching practice in Latin American countries.[1]",
        "First, since analytic philosophy was introduced in Latin America while other philosophical traditions were dominant, Latin American analytic philosophy often deals with metaphilosophical issues such as the nature of philosophy, its role in society, its relation to other philosophical traditions, and the best ways of teaching it.",
        "The creation of these two new groups indicates the presence of a growing community of people interested in philosophical analysis. It was in the C\u00edrculo that they discussed a manuscript of Bunge\u2019s Causality: The Place of the Causal Principle in Modern Science\u2014one of the first and most significant analytic works published by a Latin American philosopher."

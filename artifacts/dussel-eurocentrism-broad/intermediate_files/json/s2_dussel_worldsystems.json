      "abstract": "The study focuses on the dynamics of capitalism, accumulation cycles, global relations, and interactions with developing countries. In this context, it analyzes the approaches of theorists such as Immanuel Wallerstein, Ernest Mandel, Giovanni Arrighi, Karl Polanyi, Max Weber, and Robert Gilpin within the framework of neoliberal and dependency theories. The study aims to examine these theoretical approaches based on the \u2018World-Systems Theory\u2019 and to evaluate the accumulation cycles of capitalism, relations with developing countries, and the results of neoliberal reforms in T\u00fcrkiye between 1980 and 2000. Using content analysis methods, the changing roles of capital, labor, and inter-country relations are examined within an analytical framework. The study's findings indicate that the policies implemented in T\u00fcrkiye and other developing countries during this period prioritized economic interests over socio-cultural adaptation, leading to negative outcomes within the framework of neoliberal globalization. Consequently, the study periodically addresses how the theorists\u2019 views are supported or questioned through the developing countries with the Turkish example and how these views contribute to the global economy.",

      "abstract": "One of the social sciences theories that has contributed significantly to the complex understanding of the modern capitalist/colonial world and the situation of Latin America in it has been the world-systems approach. However, world-systems theory cannot be separated from dependency theory since the latter provides theoretical bases for the former, especially regarding the distribution of countries into different special zones according to the functioning of the world economy. But how have these theorists positioned Latin American countries in the world system? How has their understanding of the region evolved? Through the review of the literature, systematised in three stages (pre-theoretical, synchronous, and diachronic), this article examines the historical peripheral and semiperipheral positioning of the Latin American countries and the basis for determining different degrees of peripheralisation and semiperipheralisation. The relative immobility of the countries in the region stands out, which over the decades has not improved their structural position, necessitating a review of the Latin American countries\u2019 development strategies for the twenty-first century.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to analyze the relevance of dependency theory and modern world-systems analysis in understanding the contemporary dynamics of global capitalism. Instead of discussing their epistemological validity, this study suggests tackling the dependency and world-systems approaches as analytical tools to explore recent political and economic developments. It assesses the applicability of these approaches through cases studies of primitive accumulation, unequal exchanges and financial subordination. The study initially examines the primitive accumulation in peripheral countries through extractive industries controlled by multinational corporations and the commodification and privatization of natural resources. Secondly, it analyzes the continuous transfer of surplus value from the periphery to the core through unequal exchanges. These exchanges stem from wage and resource price disparities between core and peripheral countries, perpetuating hierarchical trade relations and fostering uneven development. Thirdly, the study discusses the process of financialization, which entails debt-credit relations leading to perpetual debt traps for structurally fragile peripheral countries \u2013 termed \u201cfinancial subordination.\u201d It is shown that the global currency hierarchy and the volatility of capital flows exacerbate the vulnerability and peripheralization of developing and emerging economies. The analysis of these three cases confirms that the dependency and world-systems approaches offer valuable insights for interpreting contemporary dynamics in global capitalism.",

Here we offer in great detail and textual evidence the reasons why the world-system perspective (before having been baptized as such) is not a mere US-American (or \u201cgrin-go\u201d) copy of dependency theory. This will be addressed, first of all, with an analysis of the \u201cformal\u201d aspects in the main dependency works\u2014Dependencia y desarrollo en Am\u00e9rica Latina (1969), by Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Fa-letto; Dial\u00e9ctica de la dependencia (1973), by Ruy Mauro Ma-rini; and El capitalismo dependiente latinoamericano (1974), by Vania Bambirra\u2014through the theoretical, methodological and epistemological lenses of the essay \u201cThe Comparative Study of National Societies\u201d published by Terence K. Hop-kins and Immanuel Wallerstein in 1967 regarding the VI World Congress of Sociology in 1966 in Evian (France). Sec-ondly, we will delve into the \u201csubstantive\u201d aspects\u2014that is, the methodological as well as epistemological discrepancies\u2014between both approaches. Although they are not completely antagonistic, we want to make it clear, on the basis of their methodological and epistemological foundations, not fully discussed until now, that the lines of research in dependency theory and in world-systems analysis have divergent implications.",

      "abstract": "This article analyzes the potential of world-systems analysis as a radical sociological alternative to mainstream theories of international relations, such as liberal idealism and political realism. It briefly outlines the main theoretical and methodological tenets of these traditional approaches. The intellectual genealogy of world-systems analysis is explored, along with a historical reconstruction of the conditions under which it emerged. The analysis demonstrates its connection to dependency theory and the world-systems approach employed by historians of the Annales school. Special attention is given to the philosophical foundations of the discussed concepts and their relationship to grand political narratives, as well as to practical knowledge (phronesis), which allows for a consistent examination of the differences between their problem-oriented and critical dimensions. The article highlights methodological challenges of world-systems analysis as a structuralist sociological theory that seeks to explain the stability of macro-social processes over extended periods (la longue dur\u00e9e). Particular focus is placed on the issue of semi-peripheral statehood and the limits of agency/subjectivity of individual states within the capitalist world-system at various stages of accumulation/hegemony cycles. Finally, the article demonstrates the potential of world-systems analysis as an applied theory with significant capacity for clarifying national interests and identifying attainable goals for national development by mapping the structure of political and economic opportunities available to individual states within the capitalist world-system.",

The need to overcome the underlying economic reductionism of these ideas determines, among other things, the importance of analyzing the political and legal component of this theory in the context of its current transformation. One of the key concepts in this context, mediating the conceptual framework of this theory as a whole, is the idea of so-called \u00absubsovereignty\u00bb, developed in recent years by a number of scholars.

The second was \u201cdependency theory\u201d or \u201cworld systems theory,\u201d for which UDSM became a centre as Dar es Salaam\u2019s fame in global leftwing circles attracted Marxist academics like Walter Rodney, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Giovanni Arrighi. In contrast to the \u201cDar School,\u201d these scholars worked at a distinctly global scale and future-oriented timeline. Comparing the epistemological approaches of these schools as different attempts at a meaningful decolonisation of knowledge, the article also re-embeds them in the material politics of the University at the time. For underneath UDSM\u2019s two expatriate-driven \u201cschools\u201d was a gradual but significant decolonisation of the professoriat happening just below their scholarly radars \u2013 one in which Walter Rodney, not coincidentally, would play a major role.\n",

      "abstract": "Global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) have played a dominant role in shaping the global financial architecture since their establishment at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference in the United States. On paper, critics say that these institutions were created to promote international economic cooperation, stabilize currencies, and rebuild economies after World War II. However, their operations in the global south have often been critiqued for perpetuating structural inequalities. This is because IMF and WB through the structural adjustment programs (SAPs) to debt servicing obligations, impose neoliberal economic reforms that prioritize laissez-faire and fiscal austerity, frequently undermining the role of state sovereignty. The African continent has not been immune from the impacts of these institutions on development possibilities. Therefore, the paper used the classical Dependency Theory to explore the role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in Africa\u2019s (under)development possibilities. The paper utilized a qualitative secondary analysis, drawing on existing literature as the foundation for the analysis. The findings indicate that IFIs function to integrate African economies into the global capitalist system as subordinate entities, perpetuating exploitative dynamics. The paper concludes by arguing that the current IFIs loan and reform policies are both a constraint and a paradox for Africa\u2019s development possibilities. The paper recommends alternative development paradigms that challenge capitalist hegemony and foster equitable, self-determined growth pathways for Africa. The paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of IFIs in shaping Africa\u2019s economic trajectory, highlighting how their loan conditions and structural reforms reinforce dependency rather than fostering genuine development.\n\nKeywords: Bretton Woods Conference, Dependency Theory, International Financial Institutions, Structural Adjustments Programmes",

      "abstract": "This article advances a refined reappraisal of World-Systems Theory (WST) through systematic analysis of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), conceptualizing the initiative as a world-systemic force rather than a conventional geopolitical strategy. It argues that \u201cWorld System 2.0\u201d does not propose a new world order separate from Wallerstein\u2019s modern world-system; instead, it represents a theoretical updating of classical WST that retains the capitalist world-economy framework while reinterpreting how systemic power is exercised through infrastructure, finance, digital platforms, and temporal governance. Empirically, the study demonstrates how BRI projects recalibrate global trade corridors, debt relations, and technological standards, generating network-based hierarchies that reconfigure core, semiperipheral, and peripheral positions. Using a multi-scalar qualitative methodology, combining policy analysis, institutional mapping, and case studies from South Asia, East Africa, and the Balkans\u2014the article assesses whether the BRI produces structural transformation or reproduces dependency in new spatial forms. The findings indicate that China\u2019s rise reflects an infrastructure-centered, post-territorial modality of hegemony that reshapes systemic power while preserving the underlying logic of global capitalism.",

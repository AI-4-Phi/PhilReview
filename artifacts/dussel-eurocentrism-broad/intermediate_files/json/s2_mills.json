      "abstract": "In Charles Mills\u2019 essay, \u201cWhite Ignorance,\u201d and his trail-blazing monograph, The Racial Contract , he developed a view of how Whiteness or anti-Black-Indigenous-and-Latinx racism causes individuals to hold false beliefs or lack beliefs about racial injustice in particular and the world in general. I will defend a novel exegetical claim that Mills\u2019 view is part of a more general view regarding how racial injustice can affect a subject\u2019s epistemic standing such as whether they are justified in a belief and whether their degree of confidence in the belief is rational given their evidence. Then, in light of this novel exegetical claim, I show how this interpretation of Mills\u2019 view about how racial injustice causes ignorance relates to proper evaluation of whether justified philosophers and social scientists count as epistemologically justified in holding the views that dominate their respective scholarly literature.",

      "abstract": "Charles Mills thinks that contemporary liberal political philosophy has a race problem. Its most celebrated theory of justice cannot rectify the shameful American legacy of white wrongs against black rights. This explains why he has been so critical of John Rawls. Mills argues that Rawls has produced principles of justice that are utterly unfit for racial justice duty. The publication of Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism marks the twentieth anniversary of Mills\u2019s contemporary classic,The Racial Contract. This new book, mainly a collection of previously published essays, lays out his evidence\u2014most of it historical, sociological, and psychological\u2014for why liberalism has a race problem. It explains why he refuses",

      "abstract": "Abstract Paul Wragg\u2019s book, Free Speech Theory: A Radical Restatement, is arguably the most important work on free speech theory since Frederick Schauer\u2019s now-classic Free Speech: A Philosophical Enquiry. The theoretical issues of freedom of speech have hitherto been dominated in the international arena by the US literature, which builds on the First Amendment jurisprudence as its starting point. Now, an essential European work digs deep into the question and, moving away from legal positivism, seeks an answer to the question: \u2018What is free speech?\u2019 Wragg gives a new, revelatory interpretation of John Stuart Mill\u2019s oft-quoted essay, \u2018On Liberty\u2019. The author argues forcefully in defence of \u2018irrationality\u2019, which is the keyword of the book. For him, the very essence of free speech is the protection of irrational speech, that is, speech regarded as worthless by traditional free speech justifications. This is not to unleash foolishness and irresponsibility, but to protect the freedom and autonomy of the individual. Wragg follows the greatest liberal English traditions, as his ideal is the individual responsible for themself.",

      "abstract": "First, I want to thank Professor Rosen\u2019s deep and illuminating study of the Philosophy of Stuart Mill. In my view, one of the most important contributions of the author is his claim that Mill was not only a social moralist but was primarily a philosopher and a logician. In many ways, Rosen is right. Mill was not a moral philosopher, or at least was not only a moral philosopher. However, he was concerned with the part of philosophy that deals with morality and enthusiastically defended both the welfare and the individual and social development. First, I want to thank Professor Rosen\u2019s deep and illuminating study of the Philosophy of Stuart Mill. In my view, one of the most important contributions of the author is his claim that Mill was not only a social moralist but was primarily a philosopher and a logician. In many ways, Rosen is right. Mill was not a moral philosopher, or at least was not only a moral philosopher. However, he was concerned with the part of philosophy that deals with morality and enthusiastically defended both the welfare and the individual and social development. As we say, Mill was not only a moral philosopher, because in many cases he anticipated to contemporary metaphysics, showing that the principles of normative ethical could be defended so that the human intellect helps to understand them. Even so, it should be added that Mill was, however, a reformer and a defender of moral character education. I think no exaggeration to say that Mill used logic and reasoning as ways to promote intellectual and moral development of all human beings, which is necessary for the individual improvement of welfare and social harmony. Reading Mill carefully is discovered that all his reasoning and use of the senses is aimed at deepening the welfare of all members of humanity, recommending the highest pleasures (more developed). Being a moral philosopher is not so, and as Fred Rosen suggests in his brilliant work, an obstacle to Mill being a defender of ethical revolution of society, i.e., the transformation of human life. Thus, while I deeply admire the contribution of Professor Rosen to the study of Mill, I will show my disagreement with it at some length, and finally I will also summarize the main points of convergence between the study of Rosen and my own view of John Stuart Mill\u2019s thought.DOI http://dx.doi.org/10.15304/t.20.1.2623",

      "abstract": "Poetry is a type of literature that's more than just words on a page; it carries deep significance. One way to understand the meaning of poetry is by applying Riffaterre's semiotic theory as an analytical tool. Michael Riffaterre\u2019s theory of semiotic poetry analysis highlights the need to focus on a poem\u2019s language structure and elements. This approach helps to comprehend the overall meaning of the poem in three steps. The aim of this study is to understand the heuristic and hermeneutic reading process as well as identify instances of discontinuous expression in the poem \"Mukhodh Lil Wiladah Fi Al Akhdharar.\". This study is qualitative descriptive research that uses Michael Riffaterre's theory as a conceptual framework for analyzing poetry as a source of data. The method of analysis employed in this study is the technique developed by Mills and Humberman. The heuristic and hermeneutic analyses reveal that the poem \"Mukhodh lil wiladah fi al akhdhahrar\" by Ahmad Binmaimun broadly addresses matters related to life and humanitarian concerns. In the heuristic reading, the poem largely reflects the author's fascination with the concept of birth. Generally, the hermeneutic interpretation of Ahmad bin Maimun's poem \"Mukhadh lil wiladah fi al akhdhahrar\" conveys life's meaning and is rich with metaphorical language about human existence. The writer aims to communicate to the reader a profound desire to experience rebirth. Fueled by dreams and unwavering resolve, the writer expresses readiness to rise once more, striving to enhance all conditions for the better. The discontinuity of expression indicates that there are 13 instances of word meaning substitution, including 3 similes, 3 metaphors, 2 instances of personification, 1 allegory, 1 synecdoche, 2 metonymies, and 1 epic parable. As for the deviation of meaning, it includes 1 ambiguity, 1 contradiction, and 1 nonsensical expression. In terms of meaning creation, there is 1 instance of enjambement.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A familiar debate in the philosophy of sport concerns the question of whether fans should seek to be partisans (those who support particular teams or individuals) or whether they should instead adopt the impartial attitude of the purist . More recently, Kyle Fruh et al. have argued in defense of fair-weather fandom, which they understand as a form of fandom that involves adopting temporary allegiances in response to non-sporting considerations. This paper will add a new form of fandom to this discussion: the foul-weather fan. While fair-weather fans adopt temporary allegiances or strengthen existing allegiances for teams when things are going well, foul-weather fans do so when things are going badly. We will argue that foul-weather fandom can be both instrumentally valuable, as it helps to protect valuable sporting institutions, and non-instrumentally valuable, as these fans display concern, empathy, or support for sporting individuals or teams that are going through tough times. We finish by discussing how a specific form of foul-weather fandom may be associated with a distinctive moral danger in putting people in positions where they may become complicit in a club\u2019s immorality.",

      "abstract": "This article seeks to analyze how the sense of transmodernity is subsumed in phi- losopher Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez, to propose an emancipatory policy. Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

This essay will engage with the negotiations between transmodern novel-writing and the rewriting of stories/histories as they navigate the world, with the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean as maritime nodes of pluriversal circulation of cultural meaning. I focus on Amitav Ghosh\u2019s\n Gun Island\n and\n The Nutmeg\u2019s Curse\n to argue that, as the same colonial mechanisms are replicated globally, interoceanic routes of transmodern cultural exchange generate stories/histories that counterbalance the impositions of global modernity, promoting freedom from compulsory Eurocentric models.\n",

It asks whether we must distinguish between a social-historical condition, that of transmodernity, and an aesthetic mode, that of transmodernism, as we do between modernity and modernism, or postmodernity and postmodernism. These theoretical observations are then brought to bear on my reading of a Bengali novel, Akhtaruzzaman Elias\u2019s\n Khw\u0101bn\u0101m\u0101\n (Dream chronicle), first published in 1996. This text focuses both on the subjectivity and the subjection of the peasant in a time of upheaval, as they are called upon to negotiate pasts that survive as memory, dream or trauma, and to cope with a present of alienation and suffering. Elias deconstructs the politics of nationhood, offering in its stead an insurrectionary poetics that subjects history, time and nature to the dialectical (or, as Dussel might put it, analectical) promise of allegory.\n",

      "abstract": "\nIn this essay I engage with the writings of the Argentine-Mexican Marxist philosopher Enrique Dussel for a multifaceted understanding of transmodernity and its value as a theoretical paradigm for reading and interpreting literary and cultural texts. Transmodernity, for Dussel, is a global phenomenon that subsumes and transcends European Modernity of the last five centuries and rejects the latter\u2019s epistemological hegemony in favor of a vaster, more ancient imaginary that includes the nondominant, the exteriorized, and the neglected majority of the world. In contextualizing Eurocentric modernity and repudiating its hegemony and pernicious developmentalism, transmodernity zooms out of EuroAmerica to refocus attention on frameworks of contact and multiplicity that do not rely upon the hierarchization of modernities as dominant, on the one hand, and derivative, on the other. By disengaging from the center-periphery model, transmodernity foregrounds laterality, relationality, and adaptation as potential theorizations for how cultures and languages in contact emerge and function. The essay explores dimensions of transmodernity by examining four crucial terms in Dussel\u2019s thought: people, exteriority, transversal, and analectical. Dussel\u2019s lifelong commitment to the indigenous and the marginalized cultures of Latin America provides us, I argue, a model for imagining regional, South-South interculturalities that can be, on their own terms, fully modern.",

Given that Dussel sees the role of politics as perpetuating life on earth, the transmodern world must also be based on politico-economic institutions that use natural resources sustainably. The institution of the commons, or communal management of natural resources, both predates capitalist modernity and is found in most of the cultures that constitute the periphery of the current capitalist world system. In this context, this article examines the tensions between capitalist modernity and commons-based social arrangements in Anita Agnihotri\u2019s 2015 Bengali novel Mahanadi, arguing that Mahanadi envisions the commons as a creation through mutualistic relations between humans and nonhumans, and also that the vision of the commons that Agnihotri\u2019s novel puts forward could be read as a transmodern institution.",

In this sense, the article develops the discussion on rationality and irrationality of modernity (myth of modernity) and its transmodernity (overcoming), as it is directly related to the question of the negative dialectical method with the negation of otherness - of indigenous populations - in philosophical systems. Eurocentric totality and points out the analytical movement as overcoming, expanding and liberating the negative dialectical method. It also outlines the intercultural philosophy of Raul Fornet-Betancourt, which aims at a symmetrical dialogue between philosophical knowledge. It is inferred, from the Liberation of the Other as Alterity and Interculturality, the concrete existence of a dialogical relationship between philosophical knowledge, enabling greater cosmological, philosophical and educational enrichment, as well as the teaching of intercultural philosophy in indigenous schools. In this study, the bibliographic review is the methodological strategy used.",

The critique of Eurocentrism and the construction of an alternative paradigm based on horizontal intercultural dialogue are also stressed.

      "abstract": "This article begins with a discussion of the implications of Enrique Dussel\u2019s \u201cI conquer, therefore I am\u201d (ego conquiro) thesis as the paradigm of modern imperialism. According to Dussel, underlying the \u201cmyth of modernity\u201d (mito de la modernidad) is an epistemological structure of a substantive ego that naturalizes European colonial expansion. Dussel admits that the \u201cI conquer, therefore, I am\u201d thesis began earlier than Descartes\u2019s account of the cogito, which was theorized after the Spanish colonization of the Americas, but the substantive \u201cI\u201d that constitutes the ego conquiro nonetheless represents a theory of knowledge that served and continues to serve the political domination of bodies that have been historically victimized. Couched within the epistemic structure of Descartes\u2019s cogito is a duality between soul and matter, where the former represents an immortal substance detached from the body, taken to be the recipe for rational truth, while the latter is reduced to a quantifiable object occupying a \u201czero-point\u201d geometrical space. But the cogito became the epistemological standpoint that allowed for the justification of the many hidden forms of domination around the world, because it masks the social, economic, and geopolitical contexts and their history to the modern subject. This article will investigate the ego conquiro thesis and its link to epistemic violence, namely, epistemic racism and epistemicide, and will argue as a concluding point for a method of resistance that foregrounds philosophical pluralism to disrupt the internalization of the epistemologies of the Global North as the common-sense position(s) of today.",

      "abstract": "Unprecedent times to reflect and ponder: Is it possible to claim an unified way of thinking? Will these circumstances help us catch a glimpse of another way to be in the world? To tear modern and post-modern parameters we need to view things from a different perspective. Dussel describes this as a new way of creating the world, transmodernity. The means to recognize and live other worlds are diverse and unknown, we will show one that existed centuries ago, when we weren't America yet and colonization, an imposition that tried to silence native peoples, didn't exist. By aiming at a decolonizing atitute, we invite ourselves to experiment an \"insertion or interculturation\" or an \"indigenization\"; they are possibilities to surpass the dominant racional paradigm and acess the \u2018ayxa sk\u2019ujol, to be between humans \"with heart\" and \"not between cerebrals\". A possible way to acess this ancestral knowledge requires a contextual key upon an unknown and disregarded language. We'll use Lenkersdorf in his book \u201cFilosofar en clave tojolabal\u201d as well as some papers written by mayan people on the contemporary resistance's struggle. The Mayan language has the sound \"tic\" as sufix and it's the key that makes we, westerns, baffled, confused or is beyond our understanding.",

I argue that definitions of \u201cglobalization\u201d articulated primarily through economic metrics insufficiently account for the violences concomitant with such a project. In response to this insufficiency, I draw on three concepts by three decolonial authors\u2014transmodernity (Enrique Dussel), global coloniality (Anibal Quijano), and dialogical cosmopolitanism (Eduardo Mendieta)\u2014in order to develop my own definition of globalization. I then offer a preliminary sketch of what I call \u201caffective alternatives,\u201d which could convey ways of life different from the hegemonic social forms that globalization promotes and imposes. At the very least, affective alternatives present a parallax: seen and felt from the perspective of the alternative, globalization is not taken as neutral, normal, irreversible, or desired; rather, it is \u201cdistorted\u201d into globalization/coloniality, a project to be resisted. I conclude with reflections on connecting and deepening coalitions of resistance.",

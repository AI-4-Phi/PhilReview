      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This brief article draws attention to the contributions of the Argentinian-Mexican philosopher and scholar Enrico Dussel who died in November 2023. Only a portion of Dussel\u2019s writings are available in English and his vast intellectual output, frequently laden with puzzling diagrams and figures, makes for a heady mix. In what follows, the aim is simply to identify some of his main ideas, especially as we might relate these to social work. The article explores, therefore: Dussel\u2019s conceptual vocabulary; his emphasis on the need to take care of the planet and its natural resources; his politics and ideas relating to the \u2018will-to-live\u2019; his ideas on change; and his three core ethical principles.",

      "abstract": "First published in Spanish in 2006, Twenty Theses on Politics is a major statement on political philosophy from Enrique Dussel, one of Latin America\u2019s\u2014and the world\u2019s\u2014most important philosophers, and a founder of the philosophy of liberation. Synthesizing a half-century of his pioneering work in moral and political philosophy, Dussel presents a succinct rationale for the development of political alternatives to the exclusionary, exploitative institutions of neoliberal globalization. In twenty short, provocative theses he lays out the foundational elements for a politics of just and sustainable coexistence. Dussel first constructs a theory of political power and its institutionalization, taking on topics such as the purpose of politics and the fetishization of power. He insists that political projects must criticize or reject as unsustainable all political systems, actions, and institutions whose negative effects are suffered by oppressed or excluded victims. Turning to the deconstruction or transformation of political power, he explains the political principles of liberation and addresses matters such as reform and revolution.\n\nTwenty Theses on Politics is inspired by recent political transformations in Latin America. As Dussel writes in Thesis 15, regarding the liberation praxis of social and political movements, \u201cThe winds that arrive from the South\u2014from Nestor Kirchner, Tabare Vasquez, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Evo Morales, Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, and so many others\u2014show us that things can be changed. The people must reclaim sovereignty!\u201d Throughout the twenty theses Dussel engages with Latin American thinkers and activists and with radical political projects such as the World Social Forum. He is also in dialogue with the ideas of Marx, Hegel, Habermas, Rawls, and Negri, offering insights into the applications and limits of their thinking in light of recent Latin American political thought and practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that while uneven and combined development (U&CD) scholars have made great contributions to theorising the causal implications of societal multiplicity, the overtly normative contributions of U&CD scholarship remain thin. To address this gap, I propose a synthesis between U&CD and Enrique Dussel\u2019s normatively oriented liberation philosophy. To enable this, U&CD must be stripped of its more causally oriented concepts, like the \u2018whip of external necessity', which constrains the scope of normative analysis by confining it to sovereign states. Incorporating Dussel\u2019s liberation philosophy and its concept of exteriority into U&CD\u2019s social ontology enables seeing beyond the states-system and allows for the inclusion of stateless peoples as entities and agents of global politics. This is demonstrated by applying the combined conceptual framework to the Chiapas Zapatista movement\u2019s relation to the Mexican state.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

More than an object of study, the present work locates Maya culture as a living historical subject, underlining its cosmovision, community - based practices and ways of resisting modern colonial structures. From an ethical perspective grounded in alterity, this article argues that the cultural practices of living Maya communities constitute a critical and emancipatory source for the ongoing construction of a broader alternative civilizational horizon in Latin America. Furthermore, it reflects on contemporary forms of Maya fetishism and on the need for intercultural politics in the Yucatan Pen\u00ednsula aimed at strengthening cultural and community autonomy.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article offers close readings of Derrida\u2019s Specters of Marx and Dussel\u2019s The Theological Metaphors of Marx, both published in 1993, and argues that the combining of deconstruction and decolonization offers important theoretical and political strategies for liberation theologies in the present moment. It is argued that Derrida\u2019s reading of Marx proceeds by means of \u201comissions\u201d and Dussel\u2019s offers an \u201cexaggerated\u201d reading of Marx. Combined, these readings can respond to a renewed \u201cred scare\u201d that marks the current reactionary discourse that attacks all movements perceived to be associated with \u201cMarxism\u201d or \u201ccommunism.\u201d The concept of a hauntology of liberation is developed to theorize a way of naming something or someone as \u201cMarxist\u201d only to then mount an attack to this perceived threat.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Contemporary right-wing politicians and movements \u2013 traditionally associated with anti-Semitism \u2013 have adopted a new approach towards Judaism (not necessarily towards Jews), coupling biblical archetypes with contemporary political figures. Leaders such as Javier Milei, Donald Trump, and Jair Bolsonaro incorporate biblical tones into their political speeches and refer to \u201cthe forces of heaven\u201d supporting their campaigns. The figure of Moses is frequently invoked, and more often than not misused, for a variety of purposes, all of them far removed from the ethos of Liberation theology. In this article, we explore the debates within Catholicism regarding the figure of Moses and its place in Christian theology. Since the post-World War II era, progressive Catholics in Latin America invoked the figure of Moses more often than public figures associated with Judaism. We trace the changing place of Moses in Latin American politics from the Colombian priest Camilo Torres and the Peruvian priest Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez with his liberation theology to the use of this prophet of Israel by Milei to justify his anarcho-capitalism.",

This article uses a broad array of sources to present the congress as a mass counterinstitution in which a variety of social actors\u2014including not only the invited speakers, but also conference organizers and audience members\u2014struggled to establish nonauthoritarian forms of knowledge production. The record of these efforts, and in particular the audience's demand to participate directly in the production and exchange of ideas, illuminates the ways in which radical intellectuals' challenge to dominant institutions in the global North during the late 1960s threatened to undermine their own discursive authority.",

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers secondary literature analyzing Dussel's critique of the
dominant Eurocentric narrative of modernity. Key debates center on Dussel's
1492 periodization (vs. intra-European origins), his concept of the "myth of
modernity" as a justification for colonial violence, and his proposal of
"transmodernity" as a decolonial alternative. The literature includes
critical engagements with Dussel's critiques of Habermas and Hegel, feminist
readings of his theory of rationality and indigenous peoples, and recent
work on transmodernity's relationship to decolonial theory. Spanish-language
scholarship is particularly strong, with journals like Cuadernos de Filosofía
Latinoamericana and Ideas y Valores publishing sustained analyses of Dussel's
historiography and anti-Eurocentric method.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Dussel's myth of modernity thesis directly addresses how Eurocentrism
structures philosophical accounts of reason, progress, and universality. His
critique of the "developmental fallacy" and his emphasis on 1492 as the
origin of both modernity and its "dark side" (colonialism) provide a
framework for understanding how philosophical narratives exclude non-European
perspectives.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited English-language scholarship on Dussel's Habermas critique compared
to Spanish sources. Few comparative studies of Dussel with other decolonial
thinkers (Mignolo, Quijano) on the specific question of modernity's
periodization. No major book-length studies in English specifically on
Dussel's myth of modernity thesis since Alcoff & Mendieta (2000).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around three axes: (1) periodization debates (1492 vs. intra-European
origins), (2) the myth/rationality dialectic (how modernity's self-image as
emancipatory conceals sacrificial violence), (3) transmodernity as alternative
(pluriversal vs. universal modernity).

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Sympathetic engagement: 10 papers - Scholars extending/applying Dussel's
  framework (Grosfoguel, Deere, Lozano Suárez, Camelo)
- Critical evaluation: 5 papers - Feminist critiques (Lange), comparisons with
  European critical theory (Dallmayr), debates over universality (Pachón Soto)
- Expository/historical: 2 papers - Intellectual histories of Dussel's concept
  development (Pimenta)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Offers an intellectual reconstruction of Dussel's concept of modernity across different phases of his career, arguing against reductionist readings that see his work as merely a denunciation of Eurocentrism. Demonstrates how Dussel integrates history, economic history, metaphysics, and ethics into a transdisciplinary understanding of modernity as a geopolitical phenomenon rooted in World-System analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Provides essential background on the evolution of Dussel's thought, showing that the "myth of modernity" thesis develops through engagement with dependency theory, liberation theology, and Frankfurt School critical theory. The periodization of Dussel's intellectual trajectory helps clarify how his critique of Eurocentrism becomes more sophisticated over time.

  POSITION: Sympathetic intellectual history emphasizing the complexity and sophistication of Dussel's position against oversimplified readings.

  abstract = {This paper examines Enrique Dussel’s concept of modernity by offering an intellectual reconstruction of the evolution of his thought and argues that his conception of modernity is not a reductionist idea of Eurocentrism and colonialism. It emphasizes his transdisciplinary approach, spanning from history, economic history, metaphysics, and ethics, providing a rich and unparalleled understanding of modernity. This perspective reveals crucial aspects of the genesis and essence of modernity, as well as key insights to interpret its current state and fate. For this purpose, Dussel’s intellectual trajectory is divided into different phases. For each period, it highlights his primary interlocutors, topics of investigation, and insights about the essence of modernity. In this context, this paper emphasizes the roles of economic history, World-System analysis, and geopolitics in his philosophical project. In short, it argues that Dussel’s theory of modernity operates as a geopolitical turn in philosophy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically analyzes Dussel's transmodernity as a plural vision of global modernity opening multiple modes of being and thinking. Argues for a materialist (non-absolute) vision of the colonial "other" and emphasizes South-South and North-South dialogues that engage both rational-epistemic practices and creative passions beyond strict epistemology.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the relationship between Dussel's critique of modernity and his constructive proposal of transmodernity, focusing on how a pluriversal framework avoids the pitfalls of both Eurocentric universalism and cultural relativism. Particularly relevant for understanding how Dussel's account of Eurocentrism connects to his vision of decolonial alternatives.

Dussel’s transmodernity points to a plural vision of global modernity, opening multiple possible modes of being and thinking. I critically analyze Dussel’s concept of the periphery and the “other” of colonial history, arguing for the importance of a materialist and non-absolute vision of the other. I consider the possibilities of dialogue in a transmodern framework in the wake of the battlefield of colonization.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes how Santiago Castro-Gómez appropriates and transforms Dussel's concept of transmodernity (1994) for an emancipatory politics. Transmodernity is defined as a decolonial project that overcomes modernity's sacrificial myth (Eurocentric, colonizing, capitalist) by affirming the otherness of universal cultures through "analectical" method, taking modernity's rational character but opposing domination.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how Dussel's myth of modernity thesis generates specific methodological proposals (transmodernity as method) and traces its reception among younger decolonial theorists. The modernity/coloniality dialogue establishes connections to broader decolonial studies debates.

  abstract = {This article seeks to analyze how the sense of transmodernity is subsumed in phi- losopher Santiago Castro-Gómez, to propose an emancipatory policy. Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures —ana- lectic—. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity —its rational character—, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-Gómez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.},

Examines how Dussel's perspective from the "underside" of modernity (the colonized periphery) challenges and complements European critical theory's diagnosis of Enlightenment's dialectic.

  RELEVANCE: Provides crucial comparative context for Dussel's critique of Habermas and the Frankfurt School more broadly. Shows how Dussel's emphasis on 1492 and colonial violence offers resources absent in Adorno and Heidegger's critiques, while also raising questions about whether Dussel adequately engages European critical theory's insights.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes an epistemic perspective from the "subaltern side of the colonial difference" to overcome dichotomies between political-economy and cultural studies, nationalism and colonialism, economic reductionism and culturalism. Develops the modernity/coloniality paradigm drawing on Dussel's transmodernity and Quijano's coloniality of power to redefine capitalism as a world-system.

  RELEVANCE: Major statement of decolonial theory that explicitly builds on Dussel's transmodernity concept while integrating it with Quijano's framework. Shows how Dussel's critique of Eurocentric modernity becomes a foundation for the broader modernity/coloniality research program. Essential for understanding Dussel's influence on contemporary decolonial studies.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a clear Spanish-language exposition of the myth of modernity thesis, emphasizing how the category of "myth" functions in Dussel's critique—not as falsehood but as a narrative that obscures violence while claiming emancipatory status. The critique of the "developmental fallacy" is central to understanding Dussel's anti-Eurocentrism.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a key tension in Dussel's work: how to critique Eurocentrism's false universalism while maintaining a critical concept of universal validity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Edited volume featuring critical analyses of Dussel's philosophy of liberation from diverse perspectives, including feminist critiques. Contains contributions from Karl-Otto Apel, Michael D. Barber, Lynda Lange, Walter D. Mignolo, and others, plus a response essay by Dussel. The volume addresses Dussel's critiques of discourse ethics, his evaluations of Marx, Levinas, and Habermas, and his articulation of a Latin American theoretical perspective written from "the underside of Eurocentric modernist teleologies."

  RELEVANCE: The most important English-language secondary source on Dussel's philosophy through 2000. Multiple essays directly engage Dussel's critique of modernity and Eurocentrism. Lynda Lange's feminist critique of Dussel's construction of indigenous peoples in his theory of modernity is particularly relevant to debates about whether Dussel's framework adequately addresses gender and indigenous agency.

  abstract = {Fichte'sWissenschaftslehreserves an existential as well as a scientific function, and the latter is in the service of the former. So runs a central thesis, and a central theme, of Daniel Breazeale's substantial and long-awaited book on Fichte's early (or 'Jena') philosophical system. That theWissenschaftslehrehas a scientific function is a point that Fichte often trumpets. In one of his preferred formulations, its task is to identify the ground or explanation of the system of representations that are accompanied by a feeling of necessity, and of the feeling of necessity itself. Elsewhere he emphasizes that its task is to identify "die Bestimmung des Menschen" -- the specific determination (or 'vocation') of man. On Breazeale's account, however, these scientific aims are in the service of an existential purpose that is perhaps best described as palliative. TheWissenschaftslehreis Fichte's "means for coming to terms with, and if possible, mitigating, the painful existential division within our own selves" (125).
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That striking formulation of Fichte's ambition was first proposed by Breazeale twenty years ago, in a paper published inFichte-Studien.Fichte-Studien, alas, is not on the shelves of every university library. But this book should be. Breazeale himself is the undisputed dean of Fichte scholarship in the English-speaking world, and among the most important commentators writing on Fichte in any language. Over the past four decades he has not only published scores of papers on Fichte, he has also translated the vast bulk of Fichte's Jena corpus into English, producing a series of masterful critical editions. Both through his own work, and though his influence on the broader scholarly project, he has improved exponentially both the quality and the quantity of primary and secondary material available on Fichte in English. The volume under review comprises fourteen of his papers, all of which were previously published in one form or another. But this is by no means simply a volume of collected essays. Like Fichte himself, Breazeale has not been content to leave his own earlier ideas alone. He has revisited and rethought all of these papers, and the reworking has in most instances led to substantial additions and revisions. The result is a book of great clarity and insight, the mature fruit of long reflection, and one that is really without equivalent in any language.

A memorable passage from the early correspondence provides an instructive glimpse of Fichte's existential project. Writing in the summer of 1795, Fichte was seeking a rapprochement with Jacobi, who would later denounce theWissenschaftslehreas "nihilism." Fichte's letter includes a riff on the Genesis narrative, in a paragraph that concludes with this thought: "Presumption led us to philosophize, and this cost us our innocence. We caught sight of our own nakedness, and since then we have had to philosophize for our salvation." (Breazeale quotes this passage at 137, 263, 379; the mode of composition of the book does result in a certain amount of repetition). So why exactly are we in need of salvation, on Fichte's story, and how could something as obscure and technical as theWissenschaftslehreserve such a function?

Breazeale's answer is framed in terms of "the divided self." Part of the human condition, on this accounting, is to find oneself torn. The division has apsychologicalmanifestation (again and again Breazeale emphasizes the resultingpain), and seems also to have hadbiographicalreality for Fichte himself (drawing on the earliest unpublished "night thoughts," Breazeale argues that Fichte's philosophical work was driven in no small part by personal anguish). But at its root, Breazeale argues, the division is ontological. There is, according to Breazeale's Fichte, "a division at the heart of man's very being as a free, finite agent acting within a spatio-temporal world" (134).

So what is this division, and how can the project of theWissenschaftslehreprovide any kind of help in coping with it? Breazeale characterizes it in a variety of interrelated ways. On one formulation, the division is between "theory and practice," or as Fichte sometimes puts it, between "head and heart." An essential part of human existence is that we both seek knowledge about the world and also act in it. According to Fichte, developing a theme from Kant's antinomies, this dual existence threatens a rupture, specifically with respect to human freedom. From our theoretical perspective, we treat all events, including human actions, as strictly determined; as agents, as Kant's famously puts it, "we act under the idea of freedom." For Fichte, the problem of free will is no mere intellectual puzzle. It puts us at odds with ourselves, with our most developed theoretical reflections threatening to make nonsense of our commitments as agents -- and vice versa. Breazeale: "[Man is] Torn between, on the one hand, the practical certainty of one's own freedom (or moral vocation) and, on the other, the equally undeniable feeling of constraint attendant upon one's empirical awareness of oneself as part and parcel of the natural world-order" (133).

Framed in these terms, one might expect that the "philosophical salvation" about which Fichte writes to Jacobi would take the form of some kind of compatibilism. If your existential suffering derives from the problem of free will, then the philosophy section of your local library is well-stocked with remedies that promise to ease the pain. It is surprising to see how little attention Fichte devotes to this option, particularly since Hume (arguably the grandfather of modern compatibilism) plays such an important role in Fichte's intellectual landscape, as Breazeale shows in his chapters on Aenesidemus (Ch. 2), Maimon (Ch. 3), and skepticism (Ch. 9). Breazeale finds a hint of quasi-rationalist "divine compatibilism" (8) in Fichte's very early book on religion, but the compatibilist theme in Hume's writings seems not to have made any impact on Fichte. Breazeale does at one point describe Fichte's transcendental idealist as "look[ing] for some way to reconcile the experienced passivity of the intellect with the practical certainty of his own freedom or capacity for self-determination" (249). But as we shall see, the reconciliation (such as it is) is highly attenuated, and informed by deeply incompatibilist commitments.

One possible source of those commitments comes into view with a second framing of the existential division: the tug-of-war between autonomy and heteronomy. Sometimes this contrast is framed in Kantian terms as a division between pure moral reason and heteronomous passions. Human nature exhibits "an unstable combination of rationality and sensibility" (345); the result is strife in the human soul. But this familiar and ancient description of the human struggle sits alongside something distinctively modern and idiosyncratically Fichtean. The telltale sign can be found in the particular way in which the drive for autonomy is framed. As Breazeale puts it, the Fichtean I is "predetermined to will independence and self-sufficiencyas the ultimate end of all actingand as the norm for evaluating particular, concrete courses of action" (179, emphasis added). Moreover, the Fichtean conception of self-sufficiency [Selbständigkeit] requires that the I "establish [its] independence and freedom . . .fromany source of external determination" (348, emphasis added).

It is worth pausing to reflect on just how extreme this position really is. The ancient Cynics and Stoics were agreed in placing a very high value on self-sufficiency [αὐτάρκεια], but its value was in large part instrumental. If I am dependent on other things or other people for my happiness, then my happiness is to that extent fragile and vulnerable. Cultivating self-sufficiency is thus a strategy to secure happiness and insure against contingencies that might result in ethical harm. Kant had of course made autonomy a central principle of ethics, but he did not treat autonomy as itself the ultimate end in action. For Kant the ultimate end was thesummum bonum, understood as a combination of happiness and virtue. The Fichtean position on autonomy seems to be much more extreme -- so extreme that it merits a name all its own. Let's call it autono-mania. Autonomy is not simply a value, or an important or central value in human existence; it is the final aim of all action, and requires an absence of determination by anything other than oneself.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Offers a feminist critique of how Dussel constructs indigenous peoples in his theory of modernity. While appreciating Dussel's "transmodern" approach as relevant to feminist concerns about postmodernism's disabling effects on political action, Lange argues that Dussel's division of modernity into two concurrent paradigms involves problematic assumptions about indigenous agency and rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Important feminist engagement with Dussel's myth of modernity thesis, raising questions about whether Dussel's framework inadvertently reproduces colonial constructions of indigenous peoples as passive victims rather than active agents. Relevant to debates about Eurocentrism in philosophy and whether critiques of Eurocentrism avoid essentializing the "Other."

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how Dussel's myth of modernity critique targets the developmentalist assumptions embedded in Enlightenment thought. The "developmental fallacy" that Dussel identifies in Habermas and other European theorists treats non-European societies as "underdeveloped" rather than as alternative modernities or non-modern life-forms with their own validity.

  POSITION: Sympathetic reconstruction with constructive proposal for alternative conception.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Contends that globalization is less an international process than a colonial project. Develops a definition of globalization drawing on Dussel's transmodernity, Quijano's global coloniality, and Mendieta's dialogical cosmopolitanism to account for violences that economic metrics miss. Proposes "affective alternatives" to hegemonic social forms promoted by globalization/coloniality.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how Dussel's transmodernity concept is appropriated in contemporary analyses of globalization as a continuation of colonial modernity. The modernity/coloniality coupling is essential to understanding how Eurocentrism operates not just historically but in present global structures.

  POSITION: Constructive appropriation for contemporary diagnosis of globalization.

  abstract = {In this essay, I contend that globalization is less an international process and more a colonial project. I argue that definitions of “globalization” articulated primarily through economic metrics insufficiently account for the violences concomitant with such a project. In response to this insufficiency, I draw on three concepts by three decolonial authors—transmodernity (Enrique Dussel), global coloniality (Anibal Quijano), and dialogical cosmopolitanism (Eduardo Mendieta)—in order to develop my own definition of globalization. I then offer a preliminary sketch of what I call “affective alternatives,” which could convey ways of life different from the hegemonic social forms that globalization promotes and imposes. At the very least, affective alternatives present a parallax: seen and felt from the perspective of the alternative, globalization is not taken as neutral, normal, irreversible, or desired; rather, it is “distorted” into globalization/coloniality, a project to be resisted. I conclude with reflections on connecting and deepening coalitions of resistance.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Walter Benjamin's critique of progress as central to capitalist and socialist modernity, drawing on interpretations by Echeverría and Dussel. Argues that Benjamin's vision of progress as historical construction hiding underlying barbarity in power structures connects with Latin American liberation philosophies' need for a new critical look at history centered on resistance and transformation of the oppressed.

  RELEVANCE: Connects Dussel's myth of modernity to Benjamin's "Theses on the Philosophy of History" and the critique of historicism's victors' perspective. Illuminates how Dussel's anti-Eurocentric historiography shares with Benjamin a concern to interrupt triumphalist narratives of progress.

  POSITION: Comparative analysis linking Dussel to Frankfurt School messianic materialism.

  abstract = {This article analyzes the work of Walter Benjamin, focusing on his "Theses on the Philosophy of History" and his critique of progress as a central axis of capitalist and socialist modernity. Drawing on the reflections of Bolívar Echeverría and Enrique Dussel, the text argues, from a reading that intertwines Benjamin's Jewish condition and his connection with European culture, that the vision of progress is a historical construction that hides the underlying barbarity in power structures, both in capitalism and in real socialism. When the author proposes his interpretation of history "against the grain," he challenges the linear and triumphalist conception of progress, proposing a historical materialism based on the memory of the oppressed and the redemption of the victims of the past. The work also highlights how Benjamin's critique of modernity, far from being an abstract reflection, has a practical and revolutionary dimension, linking his ideas with Latin American liberation philosophies and the need for a new critical look at history. In this sense, the article argues that theology, in Benjamin's thought, does not propose a doctrine, nor a treatise on God, but rather a critical tool that allows for the interruption of the hegemonic narrative of progress and the reconfiguration of social struggles from a radically new perspective, centered on resistance and the historical transformation of the oppressed.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Under the guiding thread of a de-struction of world political history from the position of suffering living corporality, presents Dussel's context of modern politics from Política de la liberación. Modernity is not a merely intra-European phenomenon but a moment arising from the experience of colonization of the non-European Other. 1492 is the moment of the "birth" of Modernity as concept, the origin of a myth of sacrificial violence and a process of "covering up" the non-European.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the exact nature of Dussel's 1492 periodization claim: modernity's origin is not the Renaissance or Reformation (intra-European events) but the colonial encounter that simultaneously produces Europe's self-conception as "modern" and enacts violence on colonized peoples. The "covering up" (encubrimiento) is central to the myth thesis.

  abstract = {Under the guiding thread of a de-struction  of world political history, and from the position of suffering living corporality, Enrique Dussel presents the context of modern politics in the fifth section of Política de la liberación: Historia mundial y crítica. Modernity is not in this case a merely intra-European phenomenon that belongs to a periodization of history enunciated from the West. It is, on the contrary, a moment that arose from the experience of colonization of the non-European Other. As Dussel argues, 1492 will be the moment of the ‘birth’ of Modernity as a concept, the concrete moment of the ‘origin’ of a very particular ‘myth’ of sacrificial violence and, at the same time, a process of ‘covering up’ of the non-European. Understanding the context of the emergence of this colonizing experience, that is to say, of the other worlds of life before and outside of this European Modernity, is the objective of this fifth section. For this, four moments are addressed in the text: China, the Ottoman Empire, pre-modern and eastern Venice, the Italian Renaissance.Educatio},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Retraces the colonial origins of spatial organization in the Americas and Caribbean and its impact on modern structures of knowledge, power, race, gender, and understandings of global modernity. The coloniality of space dispossessed Indigenous, African, and mixed populations through new systems of control and movement (urban grids, Atlantic trade routes). Drawing on Dussel, Glissant, and Wynter, shows how movement (who travels, settles, is excluded) becomes essential to colonial control, while novel resistance and insurgency geographies emerge in Caribbean excess.

  RELEVANCE: Book-length study extending Dussel's spatial analysis of modernity's colonial origins. The focus on geography and movement complements Dussel's emphasis on 1492 as the moment when European spatial domination produces modernity's center/periphery structure. Connects Dussel to Caribbean decolonial thought.

  POSITION: Constructive extension integrating Dussel with Caribbean philosophy.

The coloniality of space dispossessed Indigenous, African, and mixed populations as it constructed new systems of control and movement. Deere demonstrates how these developments manifested, among other forms, in urban grid patterns imposed during the development of Spanish colonial cities as well as totalizing trade routes crisscrossing the Atlantic. Drawing on a range of thinkers including Enrique Dussel, douard Glissant, and Sylvia Wynter, Deere reveals how movementwho travels, who settles, and who is excludedbecomes an essential component of control under colonial rule. Against the violence of spatial reordering, Deere outlines how novel forms of resistance and insurgency geographies still take hold, particularly in the Caribbean, where landscapes remain excessive, eruptive, and uncaptured by the order of modernity.},

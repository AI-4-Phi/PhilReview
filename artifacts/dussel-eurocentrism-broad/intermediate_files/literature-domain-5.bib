DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines Dussel's responses to charges of relativism and his proposals for analogical or pluriversal universality. The central debate revolves around how Dussel navigates between abstract Eurocentric universalism and cultural relativism through concepts like transmodernity, interculturality, and pluriversality. Key works include Dussel's foundational article "Transmodernidade e interculturalidade" (2016) and the critical dialogue between Dussel and Karl-Otto Apel on discourse ethics. The domain encompasses three main clusters: (1) Dussel's positive proposal for transmodern intercultural dialogue as an alternative to both modern universalism and postmodern relativism; (2) the Dussel-Apel debate on grounding universal ethics while respecting cultural particularity; and (3) secondary literature analyzing pluriversality, analogical universality, and concrete universality in Latin American philosophy. Recent scholarship (2019-2025) shows growing interest in interculturality as critical decolonial praxis and the application of Dusselian frameworks to contemporary global challenges.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Understanding Dussel's account of Eurocentrism requires grappling with his alternative universalism. Dussel's critique of European modernity is not a rejection of universality per se, but rather a rejection of abstract, ahistorical universalism that masks particular European interests as universal human values. His concepts of transmodernity and pluriversality offer a path beyond the universalism-relativism binary that is central to assessing whether his critique succeeds philosophically.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is substantial literature on Dussel's intercultural philosophy and the Dussel-Apel debate, there are fewer works analyzing the specific mechanisms by which analogical universality avoids both abstract universalism and relativism. The relationship between Dussel's pluriversality and other decolonial concepts (e.g., Mignolo's border thinking, Walsh's critical interculturality) deserves more systematic treatment. Additionally, critical evaluations of whether Dussel's transmodern project successfully escapes Eurocentrism remain underdeveloped. Nine of twelve entries lack abstracts due to limited indexing of specialized philosophy sources.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the structure of Dussel's argument: he rejects European universalism as abstract and ideological while proposing an alternative "concrete" or "analogical" universality grounded in intercultural dialogue among the excluded. The Dussel-Apel debate provides crucial context for understanding how Dussel appropriates and transforms discourse ethics. Pay attention to the distinction between transmodernity (Dussel's concept) and postmodernity, as this distinction is often misunderstood.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dussel's transmodern interculturality (5 papers): Argues for intercultural dialogue as the basis for a non-Eurocentric universalism
- Dussel-Apel debate on discourse ethics (4 papers): Examines the tension between Apel's formal universalism and Dussel's material ethics of liberation
- Intercultural philosophy as decolonial praxis (3 papers): Explores how intercultural dialogue challenges colonial epistemologies

  abstract = {Ao reconhecer uma nova localização das culturas periféricas na história mundial, bem como partindo de uma concepção não monolítica e não substancialista de cultura, este artigo localiza, por um lado, a Europa na história mundial e propõe, por outro, um diálogo intercultural simétrico entre críticos das culturas ditas periféricas. Essas culturas periféricas foram colonizadas, excluídas, desprezadas, negadas e ignoradas pela Modernidade eurocentrada, porém, não foram eliminadas. O desafio que se coloca é o de estabelecer um diálogo transmoderno e simétrico entre essas culturas - tratadas como exterioridades da Modernidade - a fim de responder de outros lugares os desafios da Modernidade e pós-modernidade europeia.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel proposes transmodernity as an alternative to both European modernity and postmodernity, arguing for symmetrical intercultural dialogue between peripheral cultures that were colonized but not eliminated by Eurocentered modernity. He distinguishes transmodernity from postmodernity by emphasizing dialogue with the exteriority of modernity rather than internal European critique.

  RELEVANCE: This is Dussel's foundational statement on transmodernity and interculturality, directly addressing how he responds to relativism charges. The article articulates his vision of concrete universality emerging from intercultural dialogue among excluded cultures, providing the philosophical architecture for escaping the universalism-relativism dilemma central to Domain 5.

  POSITION: Represents Dussel's mature synthesis of liberation philosophy and intercultural philosophy, offering transmodernity as the path beyond Eurocentric universalism without collapsing into relativism.

  abstract = {The research examines the Latin American philosophy of liberation (L. Cea, A. Roig, E. Dussel), from which the intercultural philosophy of dialogue was developed. The dialogue between Russian and Latin American philosophers and the recognition of the philosophy of liberation in Russia are shown. Attention is paid to the discussion about the dialectic of the universal and the culturally-specific, using the example of Latin American philosophy. The article examines intercultural philosophy, which justifies the right to cultural diversity and the normativity of dialogical relations in a culturally diverse world. It analyzes R. Fornet-Betancourt's project on the intercultural transformation of philosophy, which is based on the cultural embeddedness of philosophical traditions.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the development of intercultural philosophy of dialogue from Latin American liberation philosophy, analyzing how Dussel and Fornet-Betancourt navigate between abstract universalism and relativism through dialogical intercultural relations. Critiques abstract universalism while proposing contextualized concrete universality.

  RELEVANCE: Recent (2025) analysis connecting Dussel's liberation philosophy to intercultural philosophy, addressing the central Domain 5 question of how intercultural dialogue grounds universal norms without imposing Eurocentric categories. Provides contemporary perspective on the universalism-particularity dialectic in Latin American thought.

  POSITION: Represents current scholarship positioning intercultural philosophy as response to both hegemonic universalism and fragmented relativism, emphasizing dialogue as the method for achieving concrete universality.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that the transition to transmodernity requires critical, decentered interculturality as its foundation. Examines transmodernity as transoccidentality, involving civilizational change beyond Western modernity. Discusses the role of Latin American intercultural philosophy in constructing this alternative interculturality.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Outlines the architecture of Dussel's ethics of liberation, distinguishing material ethics (concerned with production and reproduction of life) from formal moralities (concerned with procedural validity). Argues that discourse ethics is necessary but insufficient, requiring material grounding in the life of victims excluded from the community of communication.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational statement of Dussel's critique of formal discourse ethics and his proposal for complementing it with material ethics. Essential for understanding how Dussel addresses universalism: he accepts formal procedures of argumentation while insisting on material content (life) as criterion of validity.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that philosophy is entering a new age of inter-philosophical dialogue between traditions, moving beyond Eurocentric universalism toward recognition of multiple philosophical traditions addressing core universal human problems. Proposes that universality emerges from dialogue between traditions rather than from imposing one tradition as universal.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the universalism-particularity tension by proposing dialogical pluriversality: there are universal human problems, but their formulation and resolution must emerge from dialogue between diverse philosophical traditions rather from European philosophy alone.

  POSITION: Represents Dussel's vision of global philosophy based on intercultural dialogue, providing philosophical foundation for his claim that transmodernity can achieve genuine universality without Eurocentrism.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines Dussel's epistemological critique of Eurocentrism, focusing on the geopolitics of knowledge production, epistemic privilege of the oppressed, and connections to broader decolonial epistemology. The literature reveals three main debates. First, the relationship between epistemic location and knowledge validity: Dussel argues that knowledge is geopolitically situated, and dominant "Western" epistemology masks its own particularity by claiming universality. Second, critical engagement with Dussel's epistemological claims: scholars like Chambers (2020) and Irvine (2010) challenge whether Dussel's critique leads to problematic relativism or whether his "analectic" method genuinely transcends European frameworks. Third, feminist and intersectional critiques of early decolonial theory: Mendoza & Grijalva (2022) argue that Dussel and Quijano inadequately theorize gender and coloniality, revealing blind spots in the decolonial knowledge project itself.

The Spanish-language scholarship (Retamozo 2017, 2022) addresses methodological questions often neglected in Anglophone reception: how does philosophy of liberation ground critical social sciences? What criteria of truth and objectivity apply? Recent work (Timmenga et al. 2025) defends Dussel's rationalism against postmodern critiques, arguing that epistemic decolonization requires balancing critique with universalist commitments to avoid both dogmatism and skepticism.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

Dussel's epistemology is central to his Eurocentrism critique because it exposes how Eurocentric philosophy naturalizes a particular geopolitical location (Europe) as the site of universal reason. This domain connects to the broader project by showing how Dussel's epistemological arguments underpin his historical and ethical critiques: if knowledge is geopolitically conditioned, then the "myth of modernity" is not just historically false but epistemologically suspect. The literature also reveals tensions within decolonial thought—between universalism and particularism, between critique and alterity—that bear directly on evaluating Dussel's account.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Limited engagement with Dussel's use of dependency theory and world-systems analysis in epistemological context (most focus on ethics/politics). Insufficient Spanish-language work translated into English. Few studies explicitly connect Dussel's epistemology to contemporary debates in standpoint theory or social epistemology (despite conceptual overlap). The relationship between Dussel's epistemology and Mignolo's "border thinking" remains under-theorized in the secondary literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Highlight the critical/sympathetic divide: Chambers and Irvine represent philosophical objections to Dussel's epistemology (relativism, Eurocentric method), while Timmenga, Retamozo, and Mendoza/Grijalva extend or refine decolonial epistemology from within. Stone-Mediatore provides applied case study of epistemic colonialism in global ethics discourse. The synthesis should clarify whether Dussel's epistemology is defensible on its own terms or requires substantial revision.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Critical analytic perspective (Chambers, Irvine): 5 papers - Dussel's epistemology leads to relativism or fails to escape European frameworks
- Sympathetic extension (Retamozo, Timmenga, Mendoza/Grijalva): 6 papers - Dussel's epistemology can be refined and applied to social sciences, feminist theory
- Applied/case studies (Stone-Mediatore, Linhart, Hoagland): 4 papers - Demonstrate epistemic colonialism in specific domains (global ethics, science studies)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Chambers argues that the "coloniality of knowledge" thesis central to Latin American decolonial theory (Quijano, Mignolo, Dussel, Castro-Gómez) is epistemologically problematic. He contends that these thinkers offer distorted readings of Enlightenment figures (Descartes, Hume), make overgeneralized claims about "Western epistemology," and ultimately embrace epistemic relativism that undermines both social science and the subaltern's capacity to speak. The critique challenges whether decolonial epistemology can coherently ground its political aspirations.

  RELEVANCE: This is a major critical intervention in decolonial epistemology that directly targets Dussel's epistemological foundations. Chambers identifies what he sees as internal contradictions in Dussel's attempt to critique Eurocentrism while relying on European conceptual tools. For a review of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique, this represents the strongest philosophical objection to the epistemological dimension: does Dussel's position collapse into self-undermining relativism? The paper is essential for understanding limits and criticisms of Dussel's epistemological project.

  POSITION: Represents a critical analytic perspective skeptical of decolonial epistemology's coherence. Chambers argues decolonial theory needs epistemological reform to avoid relativism.

  abstract = {Epistemology and Domination: Problems with the Coloniality of Knowledge Thesis in Latin American Decolonial Theory Latin American decolonial theory is built around the thesis of the “coloniality of knowledge”, which claims that the socio-political domination of Latin America and other regions of the global periphery by European countries and the United States is directly related to the initial colonial imposition and subsequent cultural reproduction of so-called “Western epistemology” and science. I argue that the epistemological claims of four decolonial thinkers (Aníbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, Enrique Dussel, Santiago Castro-Gómez) that make up the coloniality of knowledge thesis are problematic for several reasons: they are based on distorted and simplistic readings of Descartes, Hume and other Enlightenment figures; they make contentious generalizations about so-called Western epistemology; and they ultimately lead to epistemic relativism, which is a problematic basis for the social sciences and, contrary to decolonial aspirations, renders the subaltern unable to speak.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Retamozo systematically analyzes epistemological problems for critical social science within Dussel's philosophy of liberation, focusing on three key issues: construction of objectivity, criteria of demarcation and truth, and logic of investigation. He argues that while Dussel proposes the "analectic" method for philosophical reflection, the application to social sciences remains underdeveloped. Retamozo identifies gaps in Dussel's treatment of scientific methodology and seeks to clarify the epistemological foundation needed for critical social sciences consistent with liberation philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most systematic Spanish-language treatment of Dussel's epistemology for social science. Retamozo addresses methodological questions often neglected in Anglophone scholarship: how does Dussel's situated reason generate objective knowledge claims? What distinguishes critical from positivist social science epistemologically? The paper is crucial for understanding how Dussel's epistemological critique of Eurocentrism translates (or fails to translate) into concrete scientific practice.

  POSITION: Sympathetic internal critique. Retamozo extends Dussel's project by identifying epistemological lacunae and proposing how to fill them.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendoza and Grijalva provide a feminist critique of early decolonial epistemology (Quijano, Dussel), arguing that while decolonial theorists cite Chicana feminist scholarship, they ignore Latin American feminist work and fail to adequately theorize the coloniality of gender. They contend that the social pacts between white capitalists and white working-class men that structure both democracy and citizenship make gender inseparable from analyses of coloniality. The authors argue for a distinctly Latin American feminist epistemology that cannot be substituted by Chicana theory.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals a significant gap in Dussel's epistemological project: the insufficiently theorized intersection of gender and coloniality of knowledge. Mendoza and Grijalva's critique demonstrates that Dussel's account of epistemic privilege and geopolitics of knowledge may reproduce patriarchal exclusions even while challenging Eurocentrism. For a comprehensive review, this shows internal tensions within decolonial epistemology and the need for intersectional analysis of knowledge production.

  POSITION: Feminist extension and critique of decolonial epistemology. Argues that Dussel's framework requires substantial gender analysis to avoid reproducing colonial hierarchies.

Although decolonial theorists refer to Chicana feminist scholarship in their work, the work of Latin American feminists is ignored. However, the author argues that Chicana feminist theory cannot stand in for Latin American feminist theory because “lo latinoamericano” gets lost in translation. Latin American feminists must do their own theoretical work. Central to the critique of the use of gender in decolonial theory is an analysis of the social pacts among white capitalists and white working-class men that not only exclude white women but make citizenship and democracy impossible for men and women of color in the metropolis as well as in the colony. By revealing the nexus between gender, race, and democracy, not only is the coloniality of gender apparent, but also the coloniality of democracy.},

  pages = {221--247},
  doi = {10.1017/S0031819125000087},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmenga, Van der Zande, and Zwitter defend Dussel's decolonial philosophy against charges that it either lapses into skepticism (via excessive critique) or dogmatism (via excessive alterity). They argue that Dussel's "analectics" successfully balances critique and alterity by grounding philosophical discourse in material life, thereby reconciling universality and rationality without falling into either extreme. Against Castro-Gómez and Vallega's criticisms, they interpret Dussel as a relational thinker whose universalism is context-sensitive rather than abstractly Eurocentric.

  RELEVANCE: This recent defense addresses the most sophisticated philosophical objections to Dussel's epistemology. It directly engages the tension identified by Chambers (2020) between critique and relativism, arguing that Dussel's rationalism can be defended on its own terms. For the review, this paper is crucial for evaluating whether Dussel's epistemological project is philosophically viable or whether it collapses under internal contradictions.

  POSITION: Sympathetic philosophical defense. Argues that Dussel's epistemology navigates successfully between dogmatism and skepticism through "relational thinking."

  abstract = {Abstract This paper analyses the tension between the double focus on critique and alterity within decolonial discourses. We argue that an excess of critical thinking could lead to scepticism, whereas an overemphasis on alterity could result in dogmatism. Consequently, since both approaches end up obstructing epistemic decolonization, we argue that it is necessary to strike a balance between critique and alterity; a balance that does not resolve the tension, but seeks to reveal its underlying relation. The first section locates decolonial theory within the framework of critical theory. We highlight how Quijano, Dussel and Mignolo invoke the critical tradition, whilst simultaneously claiming that a radical departure from it is necessary. Turning more explicitly to Dussel in Section 2, we explain Dussel’s analectics as a method to localize discourses, in which globally excluded perspectives are foregrounded. In the third section, we defend Dussel’s universalism and rationalism against criticisms from Castro-Gómez and Vallega by interpreting him as a relational thinker. Ultimately, the paper concludes that the success of epistemic decolonization hinges on its ability to reconcile classic notions of universality and rationality in a manner that avoids dogmatism and scepticism, namely by a continual grounding of philosophical discourse in material life.},

  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.6616128},
  language = {Spanish},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Retamozo distinguishes between method as "theoretical rupture" (epistemological break from dominant paradigms) and method as "methodological proposal" (concrete research procedures) in Dussel's work. He argues that Dussel has developed the former more fully than the latter, and proposes how philosophy of liberation can ground a critical social science program. The paper addresses foundational problems of objectivity, demarcation, and research logic for liberation epistemology.

  RELEVANCE: This is Retamozo's more recent and comprehensive treatment of Dussel's epistemology for social science. It builds on his 2017 article by proposing concrete epistemological contributions from liberation philosophy. The distinction between theoretical rupture and methodological proposal helps clarify what Dussel's epistemology does and does not accomplish, making it essential for assessing the practical implications of his critique of Eurocentric knowledge.

  POSITION: Constructive extension of Dussel's epistemology. Seeks to operationalize liberation philosophy for critical social science research.

  journal = {APA Newsletter on Hispanic/Latino Issues in Philosophy},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {4},
  number = {2},
  pages = {8--17},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vargas identifies what he calls the "Eurocentrism Problem" in Latin American philosophy of liberation: these philosophers critique Eurocentrism and advocate resisting European conceptual frameworks, yet their own work relies heavily on European philosophical terminology and theoretical apparatus (especially Levinas, Heidegger, Marx). Vargas argues that this tension between aims and methods has not received adequate reply, and reflects underlying flaws in the liberation philosophy program. He suggests the project needs recasting to eliminate dependence on European conceptual foundations.

  RELEVANCE: This is an influential early critique of the methodological tension in Dussel's project: can one critique Eurocentrism using Eurocentric tools? Vargas's argument anticipates later criticisms (Chambers, Irvine) and represents a persistent challenge to Dussel's epistemology. For the review, this establishes a key debate: is Dussel's reliance on European philosophy (Levinas especially) self-undermining, or can philosophical concepts be appropriated and transformed across geopolitical contexts?

  POSITION: Critical methodological challenge to philosophy of liberation. Questions whether the project's dependence on European philosophy undermines its anti-Eurocentric aims.

  keywords = {Eurocentrism-problem, methodology-critique, philosophy-of-liberation, High},
  abstract = {In this paper I consider a problem that has plagued various versions of the philosophy of liberation. 1 On the one hand, proponents of the philosophy of liberation generally counsel that various forms of liberation in at least the Americas requires that we should fight Eurocentrism and resist the ontology and conceptual framework of Europe. On the other hand, most of the work done in this tradition relies heavily on the terminology and theoretical apparatus of various strands of European philosophy. The apparent disconnect between the aims and methods (or if you like, the theory and practice) has given rise to a criticism I call The Eurocentrism Problem. 2 In what follows, I argue that the Eurocentrism Problem has not received an adequate reply. Until it has, there is reason to be skeptical about the philosophy of liberation as it currently exists. However, a reply can be made — though it requires we fundamentally change how the philosophy of liberation is conceived of and how it is developed. In section 1, I consider the motivations and implications of the Eurocentrism criticism. In section 2, I take up and criticize an important reply to it and offer a blueprint for an alternative conception of the philosophy of liberation. In the final sections I consider objections and replies 1. The Eurocentrism Problem The Eurocentrism Problem has several facets that we can group under the headings of dialectical, contextual, pedagogical, and practical issues. In what follows, I give a brief characterization of each of these facets of the Eurocentrism Problem. The most obvious worry is that because the philosophy of liberation is pursued in the terminology and categories of European philosophers, it re-inscribes the Eurocentrism that it2 struggles against. If one thinks, as Enrique Dussel and others have maintained, that European categories and concepts have played a crucial role in the historical3 and contemporary4 domination of the Americas, a philosophy of liberation that relies on those categories will seem a sham. Genuine liberation — economic, cultural, sexual, and so on — appears compromised when such liberation is framed in terms of the conceptual system that is bound up with the very systems of domination it is supposed to overcome.

  number = {4},
  pages = {437--454},
  doi = {10.5840/ipq201050440},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Irvine critically examines Dussel's "analectic" or "anadialectic" method, which claims to go beyond Western ontology through "revelation" of the Other, thereby achieving a "trans-ontology." Irvine questions whether analeptic actually transcends Western thinking or whether it remains within the Western philosophical tradition. He proposes a classically Western ontological critique that, he argues, remains relevant even in the "age of globalization and exclusion" that Dussel addresses.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the most sustained analytic philosophical engagements with Dussel's epistemological method. Irvine's critique challenges whether Dussel's "trans-ontology" is genuinely new or simply a variant of existing Western categories. The paper is important for assessing whether Dussel successfully develops an epistemology "from the periphery" or whether his method is parasitic on the very frameworks he critiques.

  POSITION: Critical analytic examination. Questions the novelty and coherence of Dussel's analectic method from a Western philosophical standpoint.

  author = {Stone-Mediatore, Shari},
  title = {Global Ethics, Epistemic Colonialism, and Paths to More Democratic Knowledges},
  howpublished = {Philpapers},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stone-Mediatore analyzes how colonialist elements implicit in prominent global ethics anthologies foster attitudes of superiority and aloofness toward economically struggling communities, even when these texts advocate aid to "the global poor." Drawing on Dussel, Linda Tuhiwai Smith, and other scholars of colonialism, she traces colonialist legacies in global ethics literature and proposes strategies for unsettling this epistemic colonialism and cultivating skills for more democratic global knowledge communities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a concrete case study of epistemic colonialism in contemporary academic practice (global ethics pedagogy and scholarship). Stone-Mediatore applies Dussel's insights about geopolitics of knowledge to show how seemingly neutral or even progressive ethical frameworks reproduce colonial power relations through knowledge production and circulation. The paper is crucial for demonstrating the practical implications of Dussel's epistemological critique beyond abstract philosophical debate.

It examines how, even when texts argue for aid to the poor, these elements foster tendencies in the affluent world to detach from and dehumanize people on the other side of global hierarchies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gandolfo provides an overview of liberation philosophy as a distinctive strand in Latin American thought, examining key figures including Arturo Andrés Roig, Ignacio Ellacuría, and Ofelia Schutte. He situates liberation philosophy within broader debates about Latin American philosophical identity, the proper tools and methods of philosophy, and ontological questions about the nature of being. The chapter highlights how liberation philosophy challenges dominant frameworks by centering questions of domination and liberation.

  RELEVANCE: This handbook chapter provides essential context for understanding Dussel's epistemological project within the broader movement of Latin American liberation philosophy. Gandolfo's overview helps situate Dussel's specific contributions (especially his epistemological and methodological claims) in relation to parallel developments by other liberation philosophers. The chapter is valuable for synthesis because it clarifies what is distinctive about Dussel's epistemology versus common features of liberation philosophy generally.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Linhart provides a critical analysis of scientific universalism through the lens of geopolitics of knowledge. Drawing on the modernity/coloniality research program (Quijano, Mignolo, Dussel, Lander), along with feminist and postcolonial science studies, he argues that modern science functions as a means to stigmatize, subalternize, and oppress both nature and marginalized peoples. The chapter demonstrates how the universalist claims of modern science mask its geopolitical situatedness and serve colonial projects.

  RELEVANCE: Linhart extends Dussel's epistemological critique to the specific domain of scientific knowledge production. The chapter is important for showing how Dussel's ideas about the geopolitics of knowledge apply to natural sciences (not just humanities/social sciences), and for connecting Dussel's framework to broader literatures in science studies, feminist epistemology, and postcolonial theory. This helps establish the contemporary relevance and applicability of Dussel's epistemological insights.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hoagland examines dimensions of the "coloniality of knowledge" by analyzing how Western epistemological frameworks structure what counts as legitimate knowledge and who counts as a knower. Drawing on postcolonial theory and decolonial scholarship, she identifies how colonial power relations persist in contemporary knowledge production practices, often invisibly reproducing hierarchies between global North and South, Western and non-Western knowledge systems.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides conceptual clarification of "coloniality of knowledge," a central concept in Dussel's epistemology. Hoagland's analysis helps specify what exactly is "colonial" about dominant epistemological frameworks and how this differs from overt imperialism or cultural imperialism. The paper contributes to understanding the mechanisms by which Eurocentric epistemology maintains its dominance even after formal decolonization.

  address = {New York},
  year = {2020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber presents Dussel's thought through the concept of "ethical hermeneutics," interpreting reality from the viewpoint of the Levinasian "Other"—those excluded from socio-political or cultural systems. He traces Dussel's development toward Levinas through engagement with Hegelian dialectics and stages of Dussel's ethical theory. Barber argues that Dussel's hermeneutics offers a rationality that is neither abstractly universal nor merely relative, but situated in the perspective of victims of domination.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most comprehensive English-language treatment of Dussel's epistemological-hermeneutic method. Barber's concept of "ethical hermeneutics" clarifies how Dussel's epistemology integrates ethical and interpretive dimensions: knowledge is always knowledge-for-someone, and the epistemic privilege of the oppressed derives from their material-ethical position. The book is essential for understanding the relationship between Dussel's epistemology and his broader philosophical project.

  number = {2},
  pages = {6--11},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vizcaíno offers a genealogy of the trope of fetishization in Dussel's liberation philosophy and argues that the "anti-fetishist" method central to this tradition risks perpetuating Eurocentrism. Drawing on recent cultural anthropology showing how the notion of "fetishism" emerges from Eurocentric anthropology of religion and misrepresents Afro-Atlantic religions, Vizcaíno contends that without revising the metaphysical premises of anti-fetishism, liberation philosophy contradicts its own commitment to epistemic decolonization.

  RELEVANCE: This is a provocative internal critique of Dussel's epistemological method. Vizcaíno argues that one of Dussel's key epistemological-critical concepts (anti-fetishism, derived from Marx) itself carries unexamined Eurocentric baggage. This challenges whether Dussel has successfully escaped Eurocentrism or has smuggled it in through his theoretical apparatus. The critique is important for assessing the coherence and consistency of Dussel's decolonial epistemology.

  POSITION: Critical internal assessment. Questions whether Dussel's anti-fetishism reproduces the very Eurocentrism it aims to overcome.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume collects original essays by North American philosophers engaging Dussel's philosophy of liberation, including his epistemological method. Contributors (including Karl-Otto Apel, Michael Barber, Walter Mignolo, and feminist scholars) offer critical analyses from various perspectives. Alcoff's own contribution examines the relation between power and knowledge in Dussel and Foucault. The volume represents early sustained Anglophone engagement with Dussel's epistemological claims.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational collection introduced Dussel's epistemology to North American philosophical audiences and established key interpretive questions. The volume is important for understanding how Dussel's ideas about situated knowledge, geopolitics of epistemology, and the epistemic privilege of the oppressed were initially received and debated in English-language philosophy. It provides essential context for later critical engagements (Vargas, Chambers, Irvine).

Elsewhere he emphasizes that its task is to identify "die Bestimmung des Menschen" -- the specific determination (or 'vocation') of man. On Breazeale's account, however, these scientific aims are in the service of an existential purpose that is perhaps best described as palliative. TheWissenschaftslehreis Fichte's "means for coming to terms with, and if possible, mitigating, the painful existential division within our own selves" (125).

That striking formulation of Fichte's ambition was first proposed by Breazeale twenty years ago, in a paper published inFichte-Studien.Fichte-Studien, alas, is not on the shelves of every university library. But this book should be. Breazeale himself is the undisputed dean of Fichte scholarship in the English-speaking world, and among the most important commentators writing on Fichte in any language. Over the past four decades he has not only published scores of papers on Fichte, he has also translated the vast bulk of Fichte's Jena corpus into English, producing a series of masterful critical editions. Both through his own work, and though his influence on the broader scholarly project, he has improved exponentially both the quality and the quantity of primary and secondary material available on Fichte in English. The volume under review comprises fourteen of his papers, all of which were previously published in one form or another. But this is by no means simply a volume of collected essays. Like Fichte himself, Breazeale has not been content to leave his own earlier ideas alone. He has revisited and rethought all of these papers, and the reworking has in most instances led to substantial additions and revisions. The result is a book of great clarity and insight, the mature fruit of long reflection, and one that is really without equivalent in any language.

A memorable passage from the early correspondence provides an instructive glimpse of Fichte's existential project. Writing in the summer of 1795, Fichte was seeking a rapprochement with Jacobi, who would later denounce theWissenschaftslehreas "nihilism." Fichte's letter includes a riff on the Genesis narrative, in a paragraph that concludes with this thought: "Presumption led us to philosophize, and this cost us our innocence. We caught sight of our own nakedness, and since then we have had to philosophize for our salvation." (Breazeale quotes this passage at 137, 263, 379; the mode of composition of the book does result in a certain amount of repetition). So why exactly are we in need of salvation, on Fichte's story, and how could something as obscure and technical as theWissenschaftslehreserve such a function?

Breazeale's answer is framed in terms of "the divided self." Part of the human condition, on this accounting, is to find oneself torn. The division has apsychologicalmanifestation (again and again Breazeale emphasizes the resultingpain), and seems also to have hadbiographicalreality for Fichte himself (drawing on the earliest unpublished "night thoughts," Breazeale argues that Fichte's philosophical work was driven in no small part by personal anguish). But at its root, Breazeale argues, the division is ontological. There is, according to Breazeale's Fichte, "a division at the heart of man's very being as a free, finite agent acting within a spatio-temporal world" (134).

So what is this division, and how can the project of theWissenschaftslehreprovide any kind of help in coping with it? Breazeale characterizes it in a variety of interrelated ways. On one formulation, the division is between "theory and practice," or as Fichte sometimes puts it, between "head and heart." An essential part of human existence is that we both seek knowledge about the world and also act in it. According to Fichte, developing a theme from Kant's antinomies, this dual existence threatens a rupture, specifically with respect to human freedom. From our theoretical perspective, we treat all events, including human actions, as strictly determined; as agents, as Kant's famously puts it, "we act under the idea of freedom." For Fichte, the problem of free will is no mere intellectual puzzle. It puts us at odds with ourselves, with our most developed theoretical reflections threatening to make nonsense of our commitments as agents -- and vice versa. Breazeale: "[Man is] Torn between, on the one hand, the practical certainty of one's own freedom (or moral vocation) and, on the other, the equally undeniable feeling of constraint attendant upon one's empirical awareness of oneself as part and parcel of the natural world-order" (133).

Framed in these terms, one might expect that the "philosophical salvation" about which Fichte writes to Jacobi would take the form of some kind of compatibilism. If your existential suffering derives from the problem of free will, then the philosophy section of your local library is well-stocked with remedies that promise to ease the pain. It is surprising to see how little attention Fichte devotes to this option, particularly since Hume (arguably the grandfather of modern compatibilism) plays such an important role in Fichte's intellectual landscape, as Breazeale shows in his chapters on Aenesidemus (Ch. 2), Maimon (Ch. 3), and skepticism (Ch. 9). Breazeale finds a hint of quasi-rationalist "divine compatibilism" (8) in Fichte's very early book on religion, but the compatibilist theme in Hume's writings seems not to have made any impact on Fichte. Breazeale does at one point describe Fichte's transcendental idealist as "look[ing] for some way to reconcile the experienced passivity of the intellect with the practical certainty of his own freedom or capacity for self-determination" (249). But as we shall see, the reconciliation (such as it is) is highly attenuated, and informed by deeply incompatibilist commitments.

One possible source of those commitments comes into view with a second framing of the existential division: the tug-of-war between autonomy and heteronomy. Sometimes this contrast is framed in Kantian terms as a division between pure moral reason and heteronomous passions. Human nature exhibits "an unstable combination of rationality and sensibility" (345); the result is strife in the human soul. But this familiar and ancient description of the human struggle sits alongside something distinctively modern and idiosyncratically Fichtean. The telltale sign can be found in the particular way in which the drive for autonomy is framed. As Breazeale puts it, the Fichtean I is "predetermined to will independence and self-sufficiencyas the ultimate end of all actingand as the norm for evaluating particular, concrete courses of action" (179, emphasis added). Moreover, the Fichtean conception of self-sufficiency [Selbständigkeit] requires that the I "establish [its] independence and freedom . . .fromany source of external determination" (348, emphasis added).

It is worth pausing to reflect on just how extreme this position really is. The ancient Cynics and Stoics were agreed in placing a very high value on self-sufficiency [αὐτάρκεια], but its value was in large part instrumental. If I am dependent on other things or other people for my happiness, then my happiness is to that extent fragile and vulnerable. Cultivating self-sufficiency is thus a strategy to secure happiness and insure against contingencies that might result in ethical harm. Kant had of course made autonomy a central principle of ethics, but he did not treat autonomy as itself the ultimate end in action. For Kant the ultimate end was thesummum bonum, understood as a combination of happiness and virtue. The Fichtean position on autonomy seems to be much more extreme -- so extreme that it merits a name all its own. Let's call it autono-mania. Autonomy is not simply a value, or an important or central value in human existence; it is the final aim of all action, and requires an absence of determination by anything other than oneself.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Alcoff constructs a dialogue between Dussel and Foucault on the relationship between power and knowledge, examining how both theorize the coloniality of knowledge but from different starting points. She argues that while Foucault's genealogical method reveals power's role in constituting knowledge, Dussel's liberation epistemology centers the perspective of the colonized and offers resources for transformative critique that Foucault's framework may lack. Alcoff explores convergences and tensions between their approaches to epistemic decolonization.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter provides crucial comparative analysis between Dussel's epistemology and Foucauldian genealogy, two major frameworks for theorizing power/knowledge relations. Alcoff's dialogue clarifies what is distinctive about Dussel's geopolitical approach to epistemology versus Foucault's focus on disciplinary power and normalization. The comparison helps situate Dussel's epistemological project in relation to poststructuralist critiques of Enlightenment reason while highlighting differences in their political-epistemic orientations.

  POSITION: Comparative analysis. Explores productive dialogue between Dussel and Foucault on coloniality of knowledge while noting their different emphases.

## Research Gaps Identified

Through this comprehensive search, several research gaps emerged:

### Philosophical Domain

1. **Limited philosophical work on AI and autonomy at work** - Most AI ethics is general, not workplace-specific
2. **Conceptual engineering underutilized** - Few papers explicitly revising autonomy concepts for AI era
3. **Gap between general autonomy theory and workplace applications** - Theories developed separately

### Social Science Domain

1. **Limited empirical research on AI/algorithmic management in non-gig contexts** - Most focus on platforms
2. **Few longitudinal studies** - Most research is cross-sectional
3. **Limited SDT research on AI-mediated work** - Opportunity for integration

### Methods Domain

1. **Limited examples of interview-based conceptual work** - Methodology exists but examples sparse
2. **Few demonstrations of concept revision through empirical input** - Theoretical discussion exceeds practice

### AI & Workplace Domain

1. **Limited focus on worker autonomy specifically** - Most research on control, not autonomy per se
2. **Scant research on AI in professional/knowledge work** - Overemphasis on gig/platform work
3. **Limited normative/philosophical engagement** - Mostly empirical/descriptive work

---

## Key Debates for Synthesis

1. **Procedural vs. substantive autonomy** - Which matters for workplace?
2. **Individual vs. relational autonomy** - How do AI systems affect relational dimensions?
3. **Autonomy vs. control** - Are they opposites or distinct dimensions?
4. **Deskilling vs. upskilling** - Does AI degrade or enhance worker autonomy?
5. **Worker resistance** - Can workers maintain autonomy despite algorithmic management?
6. **Empirical vs. armchair philosophy** - How should empirical work inform concept revision?

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Literature Review Writing

With 201 verified sources, ready to proceed to:

1. **Synthesis planning** - Create detailed outline for literature review
2. **Section-by-section writing** - 12 sections covering all domains
3. **Comprehensive bibliography** - Chicago style, all 201 sources
4. **Research gaps analysis** - Detailed identification of where field needs development
5. **Implications for your project** - How gaps support your empirical conceptual work

### Estimated Timeline

- Synthesis outline: Already created (needs updating with verified sources)
- Writing 12 sections: 3-5 hours
- Assembly and editing: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 1 working day for comprehensive literature review

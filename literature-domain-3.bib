DOMAIN 3: Dualization Theory and Housing-Labor Market Interactions

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines dualization theory - the creation and deepening of insider-outsider
divides in labor and housing markets. Core work by Emmenegger, Häusermann, Palier, Seeleib-
Kaiser, and Thelen establishes how continental European welfare states have institutionalized
dualism through state policy since 1990s. Dualization operates across industrial relations,
labor market policy, and welfare state, with explicit state support for differential treatment
of insiders (permanent, protected workers) vs. outsiders (temporary, precarious workers).
Recent work connects labor market dualization to housing market dualization, showing how
employment precarity affects housing tenure and burden.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Directly tests Hypothesis 5 (housing burden determined by dualized housing and labor markets).
Provides theoretical framework linking labor market status to housing outcomes. Essential for
understanding institutional complementarities between employment and housing systems.

KEY_DEBATES:
- Extent and persistence of dualization in Germany post-2010
- Causal mechanisms linking labor to housing dualization
- State's role in institutionalizing vs. ameliorating dualism
- Whether dualization is stable equilibrium or transitional state

  note = {Geography: France and Germany. Time period: 1990-2010. Data source: Labor market statistics, policy analysis, institutional analysis. Control variables: Policy regime, economic sector, worker status. Main findings: French and German political economies significantly reconfigured over past two decades with changes often piecemeal but cumulative effects profound. Dualism now explicitly underwritten by state policy. Job strategy advocated by OECD in beginning of 1990s implemented not for all workers, but for secondary labor market, while job protection increased for those in (shrinking) core sectors. Result is institutionalization, with state support, of apparently stable but distinctly less egalitarian model. Dualization begins in industrial relations, moves into labor market dynamics, and finds institutional expression in welfare state reforms. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (dualization framework), H3 (wage effects of dualization).}

  note = {Geography: Continental Europe including Germany, France. Time period: 1970s-2010s. Data source: Comparative political economy analysis, labor market data, welfare state indicators. Main findings: Poverty, increased inequality, and social exclusion back on political agenda not only due to Great Recession but also due to seemingly structural trend towards increased inequality since 1970s. Dualization is political process characterized by differential treatment of insiders and outsiders that can take form of newly created institutional dualisms or deepening of existing ones. Comparative perspective shows Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they more likely constitute core characteristic of political economy. Continental and southern European regimes perpetuate and even reinforce insider-outsider divide with regard to all three dimensions of dualism. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (comprehensive dualization framework linking labor and welfare institutions).}

Control variables: Age, income, education, employment status, household type. Main findings: Similar trends witnessed in housing markets across most advanced economies as in labor markets. Research specifically titled to link insider-outsider divides in employment and housing outcomes. Labor market dualization concept extends to housing markets. Employment precarity (outsider status) affects housing tenure choice and housing cost burden. Connects labor market position to housing market outcomes systematically. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (direct connection between labor and housing market dualization).}

  note = {Geography: Continental Europe including Germany. Time period: 1990-2015. Data source: Labor force surveys, political economy analysis. Control variables: Employment status, sector, education, age. Main findings: Labor market dualization focuses on increasing disparities between securely employed market-insiders and expanding proportions of market-outsiders with more precarious employment positions. Approach extends insights from segmented labor market theory and insider/outsider theory, which explains economic inequality and unemployment based on assumption that insiders are in powerful bargaining position because replacement of workers implies transaction costs for employers. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (theoretical foundations of dualization), H3 (insider-outsider wage effects).}

  note = {Geography: 18 affluent countries including Germany. Time period: 2000-2011. Data source: EU-SILC, labor force surveys. Control variables: Age, gender, education, household type, country, time. Main findings: Institutions that arguably protect labor market insiders (employment protection, unionization, unemployment benefits) are frequently associated with greater inequality between typically disadvantaged groups and their insider peers. Insider-outsider divides appear to be strongest in continental Europe with regard to labor market inequalities, welfare inequalities and political integration. Continental welfare regimes reinforce labor market dualism by means of taxes and transfers: net wage gaps lie between 5-8 percentage points above gross wage gaps. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (institutional mechanisms of dualization), comparative evidence for Germany.}

Main findings: Political conflict increasingly structured by insider-outsider divide. Insiders benefit from employment protection and have incentive to support policies that disadvantage outsiders. Social democratic parties face trade-off between representing core insider constituency and broader working class including outsiders. Political economy of insider-outsider division affects welfare state and labor market policy.

Labor market segmentation varies systematically across welfare state types. Insider protection combined with outsider flexibility characterizes German trajectory. Dualization is not uniform phenomenon but shaped by institutional context. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (varieties of dualization, Germany's specific pattern).}

Control variables: Union density, unemployment, government type. Main findings: Unions often prioritize organizational survival over broad membership interests, contributing to dualization. Unions more likely to protect core insider members than represent outsiders. Union behavior helps explain persistence of dualized labor markets. Organizational logic of unions reinforces insider-outsider divide. Relevance to hypotheses: H5 (union role in dualization), H3 (union effects on wage distribution).}

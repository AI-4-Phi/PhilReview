## Displacement, Migration, and the Ethics of Exile

What is lost when one loses home? This question connects philosophical inquiry into home with urgent ethical issues of forced migration, refugee crises, and urban displacement. Recent philosophical work examines both cross-border forced migration (refugees, exiles) and urban displacement (gentrification), revealing both conceptual connections and persistent theoretical gaps between these literatures.

Carens (2010, 2013) develops a sophisticated account of how time and settlement generate moral claims to stay. His core argument: although states possess rights to control borders and initially reject unauthorized migrants, the right to deport erodes with time as migrants become settled. The moral basis is "social membership"—irregular migrants gradually integrate into communities, form relationships, establish lives, and acquire stakes in the society they inhabit. After sufficient time, deportation becomes a profound harm not merely because it disrupts plans but because it tears people from their social world—their home in a thick sense. Carens advocates rolling amnesties giving long-settled unauthorized migrants paths to regularization and eventual citizenship. His work illuminates how home is constituted through time: a place becomes home not through legal status alone but through accumulated relationships, memories, and investments.

Vasanthakumar (2021) shifts attention from how migrants affect receiving societies to exiles' relationship with places they have left. Her work challenges the tendency to treat forced migrants as passive victims, instead recognizing their political agency and continuing ties to homelands. Exiles possess both rights and responsibilities regarding their places of origin: rights to maintain connections, participate in homeland politics, and work toward return; responsibilities to oppose injustice at home and support political transformation. Exile politics can correct defective institutions in homelands and compensate for global institutional shortcomings. This reframes exile not as simple loss of home but as complex transnational position with distinctive moral and political possibilities. Yet the normative force of these continuing ties depends on what "homeland" means when one cannot safely return—raising questions about whether political community or lived place grounds these obligations.

Refugee ethics confronts the darkest implications of losing home. Parekh (2017) identifies a "second crisis": not merely that people are displaced, but that refuge itself has evaporated. Refugees face only three options—squalid camps, urban slums, or dangerous asylum journeys—none providing minimum conditions of human dignity. Parekh argues that states and citizens have obligations to address structures that unjustly prevent refugees from accessing these minimum conditions. But what are those minimum conditions? Surely more than bare shelter; Parekh suggests they include security, basic services, and meaningful opportunities for life-building. This connects to Jenkins and Brownlee's (2022) conceptual framework: refugees often have shelter (camps provide physical protection) and even housing (persistent accommodation), but they lack homes in the thick sense—they cannot build lives, form stable communities, or exercise meaningful control over their social environments.

Urban displacement raises parallel questions at different scales. Van Leeuwen (2024) examines gentrification-related displacement, critiquing autonomy-based accounts that frame displacement as problematic because it frustrates residents' life-plans. He argues this approach wrongly instrumentalizes social attachments—treating them as valuable only insofar as they serve autonomous projects. Instead, social attachments possess intrinsic value: relationships, community bonds, and sense of place matter independent of their contribution to individual plans. Displacement violates respect for these attachments themselves, not merely their instrumental role. This communitarian-inflected critique challenges liberal frameworks dominant in migration and housing ethics.

Yet theoretical integration across scales remains limited. Migration ethicists rarely engage gentrification literature; urban theorists seldom draw on refugee ethics. This is puzzling given conceptual parallels: both involve involuntary separation from home, both raise questions about rights to remain, both concern how settled presence generates moral claims. The gap may reflect disciplinary boundaries (international political theory vs. urban political theory) or scale differences (nation-states vs. neighborhoods). But philosophically, both domains ask: what normative weight does attachment to place carry? When do settled residents acquire claims to remain? How do we balance mobility rights against rootedness?

Malpas (1999, 2018) provides philosophical resources for bridging this gap through his account of place as foundational to human being. Place is not merely backdrop for life but constitutive of experience, self-understanding, and practical engagement with the world. Home, as paradigmatic place, grounds identity and provides the secure platform from which we encounter others and build lives. Displacement—whether through migration, eviction, or gentrification—disrupts this fundamental grounding. But Malpas's phenomenological approach requires integration with normative political philosophy to generate action-guiding principles about when displacement is unjust and what duties we have to prevent or remedy it.

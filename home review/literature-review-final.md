# Philosophical Perspectives on "Home": A Literature Review for Encyclopedia Article

## Introduction

Home occupies a peculiar position in contemporary philosophical inquiry. While seemingly a mundane, readily understood concept—a dwelling, a place where one lives—closer investigation reveals home to be philosophically complex, normatively contested, and analytically under-theorized (Fox 2016). What distinguishes a home from a mere house or shelter? What makes homelessness not just a material deprivation but a distinctive form of injustice? How does home function as a site of both security and oppression, belonging and exclusion? These questions sit at the intersection of ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, and social theory, yet philosophical engagement with them remained relatively sparse until the 1990s.

The past three decades have witnessed a renaissance in philosophical work on home, driven primarily by analytical and applied ethics approaches rather than continental phenomenology. While Heidegger's writings on dwelling and Bachelard's poetics of space remain influential, recent philosophical work emphasizes conceptual clarity, normative argument, and engagement with empirical realities of housing crises, homelessness, displacement, and inequality. As Jenkins and Brownlee observe, "analytic philosophy has largely neglected homelessness" and the social functions of home (2022, 441), but this neglect is being corrected through sustained attention to housing justice, homelessness ethics, and the normative dimensions of domestic space.

This review focuses on analytical and applied philosophical work from 1990 to the present, organized around six major debates: (1) conceptual foundations distinguishing home from house and shelter; (2) the ethics of homelessness, particularly freedom-based and property-rights approaches; (3) housing justice and distributive justice frameworks; (4) feminist philosophical perspectives on gendered dimensions of home; (5) displacement, migration, and exile ethics; and (6) urban justice, NIMBY-ism, and housing policy. Throughout, I emphasize key tensions, identify research gaps, and highlight work that bridges philosophical theory with housing policy and empirical research.

## Conceptual Foundations: What is "Home"?

The seemingly simple question "what is a home?" reveals deep conceptual complexity. Philosophical analysis must distinguish home from related concepts—house, dwelling, shelter, housing—each carrying different normative and descriptive weight. Recent analytical work identifies a fundamental tension between legal/property-based conceptions and social/relational conceptions of home, with significant implications for understanding homelessness and housing justice.

Jenkins and Brownlee (2022) propose a "ladder of home-related concepts" ascending from temporary shelter, to persistent shelter and housing, to a rich notion of home. This framework enables crucial distinctions: one can be sheltered but unhoused (as in emergency accommodation), or housed but unhomed (lacking the social bonds and meaningful control that constitute home). The "shelterless/sheltered" distinction concerns basic physical protection; "unhoused/housed" concerns stable, persistent accommodation; "unhomed/homed" concerns meeting social needs including belonging, identity-formation, and meaningful control over one's social environment (Jenkins and Brownlee 2022, 445-447). This conceptual ladder challenges reductionist accounts that conflate home with mere physical structure.

Essert (2016, 2022) defends a competing "legal conception": to have a home is to possess property rights that give one a place where one may be as of right, free from domination by or dependence on others. Homelessness, on this view, is constituted not primarily by lack of goods or even physical shelter, but by lack of property rights—specifically, the legal authority to control access to and use of space. To be homeless is "to be under the power of others—to be dominated by them or dependent on them—in respect of where one may be" (Essert 2016, 267). Property rights uniquely solve this problem by establishing zones of non-interference. The strength of this view is its connection to republican political theory and its explanation of why homelessness persists even when shelter is available: shelters and temporary accommodation fail to provide the legal security constitutive of home.

Jenkins and Brownlee object that the legal conception is too narrow, ignoring home's social functions. Many housed persons—consider victims of domestic violence or those in restrictive institutional settings—possess property rights but lack what makes a dwelling truly a home: social bonds, opportunities for intimacy, meaningful control over one's social environment. Conversely, some without formal property rights (unauthorized occupants, squatters in stable communities) may create genuine homes through social processes. The legal conception captures necessary conditions for resisting domination but misses what makes home valuable beyond non-interference.

Both conceptions illuminate different aspects of home. The legal conception highlights home's function in securing non-domination and independence—what we might call home's protective function. The social conception foregrounds home's constitutive role in identity, belonging, and meaningful relationships—home's generative function. Neither alone suffices. A complete philosophical account must integrate both dimensions: home requires both legal security (property rights or their functional equivalent) and social conditions (relationships, meaningful control, belonging). This integration points toward an under-theorized middle ground: what property rights enable is not merely non-interference but the social conditions for building a life.

The conceptual stakes are high. How we define "home" shapes our understanding of what homelessness deprives people of, what housing justice requires, and what displacement destroys. If home is merely property, housing policy should focus on legal title; if home is primarily social, policy must attend to community formation, relationship maintenance, and participatory control. The most promising direction integrates both: recognizing that legal security enables but does not guarantee the social conditions of home.

## Homelessness Ethics: A Foundational Debate

If philosophical neglect of home seems puzzling, philosophical attention to homelessness is even more striking in its tardiness and sparseness. Yet the small literature that exists has proven foundational for broader debates about property, freedom, and justice. Three major approaches dominate: freedom-based accounts emphasizing how property rules constrain homeless persons' liberty (Waldron 1991), property-rights approaches arguing homelessness is constituted by lack of rights rather than resources (Essert 2016), and autonomy-based refinements attempting to avoid minimalism concerns (Wells 2022).

Waldron's (1991) canonical essay "Homelessness and the Issue of Freedom" established the philosophical terrain. His central claim is deceptively simple but philosophically profound: everything that is done must be done somewhere, and no one is free to perform an action unless there is somewhere they are free to perform it. For the homeless, property rules—both public and private—systematically constrain where basic life activities can be performed. Private property excludes them from most spaces; public space regulations prohibit activities like sleeping, urinating, or washing. The cumulative effect is comprehensive: there is literally nowhere the homeless person may perform necessary life functions as of right. Waldron's provocative conclusion: "the homeless are free only to the extent that society is communist" (1991, 299)—that is, only to the extent common spaces remain unregulated.

The power of Waldron's argument lies in its exposure of a structural contradiction: liberal societies proclaim freedom while maintaining property systems that systematically deny homeless persons the spatial prerequisites for exercising any freedom. Prohibitions on sleeping in public, harmless when directed at housed persons (who have private alternatives), become comprehensive bans when directed at the homeless. This reveals property not as neutral background but as active constraint. Waldron's analysis has been enormously influential, grounding subsequent work on housing rights and inspiring legal challenges to anti-homeless ordinances.

Essert (2016) accepts Waldron's diagnosis but rejects distributive justice responses. Homelessness, Essert argues, is not primarily a problem of unjust distribution of resources but a problem of lacking property rights. Providing resources—even abundant resources—fails to solve homelessness if it does not confer property rights. Consider someone placed in luxury hotel accommodation: they remain homeless if they have no legal right to remain, no control over who enters, no authority to exclude others. What matters is not wealth or resources but rights—specifically, the cluster of property rights that give one legal authority over some space. "To be homeless is to be under the power of others... in respect of where one may be" (Essert 2016, 267).

This shifts the philosophical frame from distributive justice to domination and dependence. Homelessness is objectionable not (or not only) because it involves material deprivation but because it subjects people to arbitrary power. The homeless person depends on others' permission and forbearance for the most basic spatial needs. Property rights solve this by establishing zones of non-interference. The implication: housing policy should focus on conferring property rights (ownership or secure tenancy) rather than merely providing shelter.

Wells (2022) sympathetically engages both Waldron and Essert but worries that freedom-based accounts face "minimalism concerns"—they seem to require only that homeless persons have somewhere to perform basic functions, not genuine homes. Wells develops an autonomy-based account that grounds more robust housing claims. Her key move is connecting housing to "freedom of intimate association"—the freedom to choose when and with whom we are in close relationships. Without stable housing, this freedom is systematically undermined: one cannot control who is present in one's living space, cannot exercise basic privacy rights, cannot form or maintain intimate relationships on one's own terms. The right to housing thus protects not merely negative liberty (freedom from interference) but positive conditions for autonomous life-planning (Wells 2018, 2022).

These accounts share important commonalities: all reject purely welfarist approaches that treat homelessness as merely lacking a good (shelter); all emphasize structural features of property systems; all connect housing to fundamental freedoms. But they diverge on remedy: Waldron suggests expanded commons, Essert emphasizes property rights transfer, Wells grounds claims in autonomy. Each illuminates different normative dimensions of homelessness. Yet all three accounts remain underspecified on crucial implementation questions: What exactly do homeless persons have claims to? Emergency shelter? Secure tenancy? Home ownership? And who bears correlative obligations? These questions require integration with distributive justice theories—the subject of the next section.

## Housing Justice and Distributive Justice

While homelessness ethics examines obligations toward those without homes, housing justice addresses broader questions of fair allocation: Is there a right to housing? If so, on what grounds and with what content? How should housing be distributed in a just society? Despite housing's centrality to well-being and opportunity, these questions have received surprisingly limited attention in mainstream political philosophy—a gap that recent work begins to address.

The capabilities approach, developed by Sen (1999) and Nussbaum (2000), has emerged as an influential framework for conceptualizing housing justice. The core insight is to focus on what housing enables people to do and be—their capabilities and functionings—rather than on housing as a mere commodity or resource. Housing is understood as foundational for multiple capabilities: bodily health, bodily integrity, and control over one's environment (Nussbaum 2000). More fundamentally, adequate housing provides the secure platform from which other capabilities can be developed and exercised—it is a "meta-capability" enabling education, employment, health, and social participation (Kimhur 2022; Saunders and Zhu 2020).

Recent scholarship, however, identifies serious limitations in applying the capabilities approach to housing justice. Dummer (2025) argues that without significant adjustments, Nussbaum's framework may be unsuitable as a foundational theory of housing justice. The threshold problem looms large: what constitutes "adequate housing" remains vague, and in affluent Western societies, sufficiency approaches often set thresholds at implausibly modest levels that fail to address real housing injustices. More fundamentally, housing justice involves inherently relational questions—about community composition, neighborhood quality, spatial segregation—that resist analysis purely in terms of individual capabilities. Dummer contends that an adequate capabilitarian view must integrate relational egalitarian considerations, but this integration remains underdeveloped. The capabilities approach illuminates what housing enables but struggles to explain why housing inequality matters when everyone has crossed the sufficiency threshold.

A different approach emerges from recent work on housing limitarianism. Erck (2024) develops a moral doctrine of housing limitarianism: it is wrong to possess excess housing when others lack adequate housing and when housing operates as a profit-generating commodity. This is not an egalitarian claim (requiring equal housing) but a limitarian one: there are upper limits to permissible housing wealth. The "urgent needs argument" provides normative foundation: when some lack adequate housing, excessive housing wealth by others—multiple properties, vacation homes, investment portfolios—is morally impermissible. Limitarianism addresses what capabilities approaches neglect: the problem is not merely ensuring everyone has enough, but restricting how much the wealthy may accumulate.

Housing limitarianism shifts focus from the lower tail of distribution (ensuring minimums) to the upper tail (restricting maximums). This connects to broader debates about property rights and distributive justice. Waldron's (2016) analysis of property emphasizes that private property systems entail that "no-one has the responsibility to concern themselves with the big picture, so far as the distribution of resources is concerned." Property rights fragment responsibility for distribution, making systemic injustice possible without anyone acting wrongly. Housing limitarianism challenges this fragmentation, asserting collective responsibility for overall patterns of housing distribution.

These approaches—capabilities, limitarianism, property theory—each illuminate different aspects of housing justice but remain insufficiently integrated. The capabilities approach addresses the lower bound (what must everyone have?), limitarianism addresses the upper bound (what may no one have?), and property theory examines the institutional structure mediating between them. A complete theory of housing justice requires integration: specifying minimum housing entitlements grounded in capabilities, maximum permissible housing wealth justified by limitarian concerns, and institutional mechanisms (property rules, zoning, taxation, public housing) that realize these norms while respecting legitimate interests in stability, community, and autonomy.

The most glaring research gap is philosophical engagement with actual housing crises in affluent democracies. While abstract principles proliferate, there is insufficient analysis of concrete policy tools—rent control, inclusionary zoning, public housing, land value taxation—through philosophical lenses. Dawkins (2021) provides a rare book-length philosophical treatment of American housing policy, but more work is needed bridging normative theory with institutional analysis. Additionally, the intersection of housing justice with racial and gender justice remains under-theorized despite empirical evidence of systematic disparities. Housing justice discourse has been insufficiently attentive to how housing systems reproduce and entrench race and gender hierarchies—a gap that feminist and critical race approaches might address.

## Feminist Philosophical Perspectives on Home

Feminist philosophy exposes a fundamental tension: home functions simultaneously as site of oppression and potential locus of dignity, resistance, and care. This ambivalence stems from home's historical association with the "private sphere"—a realm coded feminine, devalued in political theory, and structured to serve male projects while constraining women's autonomy. Yet feminist theorists resist simply rejecting home as a value, recognizing that for many, including oppressed groups, home provides crucial goods worth preserving and transforming.

Iris Marion Young's canonical essay "House and Home: Feminist Variations on a Theme" (1997) remains the most influential philosophical treatment of this tension. Young engages critically with feminist theorists like Simone de Beauvoir and Luce Irigaray who argue that the comforts and supports of house and home historically come at women's expense. If home means women's confinement for the sake of nourishing male projects—women as homemakers supporting men's public pursuits—then feminists have strong reasons to reject home as a value. The domestic sphere has functioned as a site of women's unpaid labor, restricted mobility, and exclusion from public life and political participation.

Yet Young observes it is difficult, even for feminists, "to exorcise a positive valence to the idea of home" (1997, 135). Home provides real goods: security, privacy, a space of one's own, respite from public scrutiny, opportunity for intimacy and care relationships. The challenge is to preserve these goods while dismantling the gendered structures that make them available to women only at the cost of subordination. Young's key insight is that "the material values of home can provide leverage for radical social critique" (1997, 148). Rather than abandon the ideal of home, we should insist that its goods—privacy, security, control over one's environment—be universally available and not premised on women's domestic confinement.

Critically, Young emphasizes that home can function as a site of dignity and resistance for oppressed groups. For communities facing hostility in public space—racial minorities, LGBTQ persons, immigrants—home may provide crucial sanctuary. This complicates simplistic narratives of home as inherently oppressive or liberatory: its meaning and function are context-dependent, shaped by power relations and social position. Feminist analysis must attend to these variations rather than offering universal pronouncements about home's value.

The public/private dichotomy animates much feminist criticism of home. Pateman (1983) argued that the distinction between public and private spheres is "central to almost two centuries of feminist writing and political struggle." Traditional political philosophy excluded the "private" sphere of home and family from political theorizing, focusing instead on state and governance—the masculine public realm. This exclusion served ideological functions: it naturalized the gendered division of labor, shielded domestic inequality from scrutiny, and framed women's subordination as natural rather than political. The feminist slogan "the personal is political" challenged this exclusion, insisting that power relations in the domestic sphere are proper subjects for political analysis and transformation.

Recent feminist political philosophy continues this critical engagement. Chambers's work on the family (2009, 2024) argues that Rawls's treatment of the family reveals fundamental problems in Rawlsian justice theory. If the family is a "basic institution" subject to principles of justice, but also (as Rawls sometimes suggests) a haven of affection exempt from justice requirements, we face a deep theoretical tension. Chambers demonstrates that the domestic sphere cannot be both subject to and exempt from justice—and that attempts to have it both ways perpetuate gender injustice. Muñoz-Dardé (1999) asks provocatively whether justice might require abolishing the family altogether, given the severe inequalities it generates. While not endorsing abolition, she uses the thought experiment to illuminate what values would be threatened by the family's elimination—and whether those values justify tolerating familial inequality.

Despite this rich tradition, a research gap persists: there is surprisingly little recent analytical feminist work specifically focused on "home" (as distinct from family or domestic sphere). Much feminist philosophy addresses family structure, care work, and the public/private distinction, but the specific phenomenology and ethics of home—what makes a dwelling a home, how gender shapes experiences of domestic space, how housing policy affects gender justice—receives less sustained attention. Notable exceptions include work on homelessness affecting women disproportionately and domestic violence rendering homes sites of danger rather than security. But systematic feminist philosophical analysis of housing justice, urban policy, and the material dimensions of home remains underdeveloped. Integrating feminist insights with the housing justice and homelessness literature discussed above would enrich both domains.

## Displacement, Migration, and the Ethics of Exile

What is lost when one loses home? This question connects philosophical inquiry into home with urgent ethical issues of forced migration, refugee crises, and urban displacement. Recent philosophical work examines both cross-border forced migration (refugees, exiles) and urban displacement (gentrification), revealing both conceptual connections and persistent theoretical gaps between these literatures.

Carens (2010, 2013) develops a sophisticated account of how time and settlement generate moral claims to stay. His core argument: although states possess rights to control borders and initially reject unauthorized migrants, the right to deport erodes with time as migrants become settled. The moral basis is "social membership"—irregular migrants gradually integrate into communities, form relationships, establish lives, and acquire stakes in the society they inhabit. After sufficient time, deportation becomes a profound harm not merely because it disrupts plans but because it tears people from their social world—their home in a thick sense. Carens advocates rolling amnesties giving long-settled unauthorized migrants paths to regularization and eventual citizenship. His work illuminates how home is constituted through time: a place becomes home not through legal status alone but through accumulated relationships, memories, and investments.

Vasanthakumar (2021) shifts attention from how migrants affect receiving societies to exiles' relationship with places they have left. Her work challenges the tendency to treat forced migrants as passive victims, instead recognizing their political agency and continuing ties to homelands. Exiles possess both rights and responsibilities regarding their places of origin: rights to maintain connections, participate in homeland politics, and work toward return; responsibilities to oppose injustice at home and support political transformation. Exile politics can correct defective institutions in homelands and compensate for global institutional shortcomings. This reframes exile not as simple loss of home but as complex transnational position with distinctive moral and political possibilities. Yet the normative force of these continuing ties depends on what "homeland" means when one cannot safely return—raising questions about whether political community or lived place grounds these obligations.

Refugee ethics confronts the darkest implications of losing home. Parekh (2017) identifies a "second crisis": not merely that people are displaced, but that refuge itself has evaporated. Refugees face only three options—squalid camps, urban slums, or dangerous asylum journeys—none providing minimum conditions of human dignity. Parekh argues that states and citizens have obligations to address structures that unjustly prevent refugees from accessing these minimum conditions. But what are those minimum conditions? Surely more than bare shelter; Parekh suggests they include security, basic services, and meaningful opportunities for life-building. This connects to Jenkins and Brownlee's (2022) conceptual framework: refugees often have shelter (camps provide physical protection) and even housing (persistent accommodation), but they lack homes in the thick sense—they cannot build lives, form stable communities, or exercise meaningful control over their social environments.

Urban displacement raises parallel questions at different scales. Van Leeuwen (2024) examines gentrification-related displacement, critiquing autonomy-based accounts that frame displacement as problematic because it frustrates residents' life-plans. He argues this approach wrongly instrumentalizes social attachments—treating them as valuable only insofar as they serve autonomous projects. Instead, social attachments possess intrinsic value: relationships, community bonds, and sense of place matter independent of their contribution to individual plans. Displacement violates respect for these attachments themselves, not merely their instrumental role. This communitarian-inflected critique challenges liberal frameworks dominant in migration and housing ethics.

Yet theoretical integration across scales remains limited. Migration ethicists rarely engage gentrification literature; urban theorists seldom draw on refugee ethics. This is puzzling given conceptual parallels: both involve involuntary separation from home, both raise questions about rights to remain, both concern how settled presence generates moral claims. The gap may reflect disciplinary boundaries (international political theory vs. urban political theory) or scale differences (nation-states vs. neighborhoods). But philosophically, both domains ask: what normative weight does attachment to place carry? When do settled residents acquire claims to remain? How do we balance mobility rights against rootedness?

Malpas (1999, 2018) provides philosophical resources for bridging this gap through his account of place as foundational to human being. Place is not merely backdrop for life but constitutive of experience, self-understanding, and practical engagement with the world. Home, as paradigmatic place, grounds identity and provides the secure platform from which we encounter others and build lives. Displacement—whether through migration, eviction, or gentrification—disrupts this fundamental grounding. But Malpas's phenomenological approach requires integration with normative political philosophy to generate action-guiding principles about when displacement is unjust and what duties we have to prevent or remedy it.

## Urban Justice, NIMBY-ism, and Housing Policy Ethics

Philosophical analysis of home confronts practical urgency in debates over urban policy, exclusionary zoning, and community resistance to new housing. How should we evaluate NIMBY-ism ("Not In My Back Yard") resistance to housing development? When does neighborhood preservation justify exclusion? What obligations do communities have to accommodate newcomers? These applied ethics questions reveal deep tensions between property rights, legitimate expectations, distributive justice, and democratic participation.

Kohn (2016) offers the most philosophically developed account of urban justice through her concept of the "urban commonwealth." Drawing on solidarism—a largely forgotten strand of left-republican political theory from late 19th century France—Kohn argues that cities are concentrations of value created by past and present generations: infrastructure, public spaces, cultural institutions, community networks. These constitute a common wealth to which urban residents have claims not as property owners but as co-creators and co-inhabitants. When people lose access to urban commons through gentrification, slum clearance, or privatization, they are dispossessed of something to which they have rightful claims—what Lefebvre called "the right to the city."

This framework provides resources for evaluating displacement as injustice. Gentrification wrongs long-term residents not merely by raising costs or disrupting plans, but by appropriating common value they helped create for the benefit of newcomers and investors. The streets, parks, cultural vitality, and community networks that make neighborhoods desirable were built through residents' investments of time, labor, and care. When market processes or policy changes transfer access to these commons from original contributors to wealthier newcomers, a form of dispossession occurs. Kohn's account thus grounds objections to gentrification in republican principles of non-domination and fair terms of cooperation, not merely in distributive concerns.

Yet solidarism's applicability to contemporary housing debates faces challenges. If long-term residents have claims to neighborhoods based on their contributions, what about NIMBY-ism that excludes potential new residents? Don't exclusionary zoning laws protect existing residents' claims to neighborhoods they helped build? Kohn would likely distinguish: claims to remain differ from claims to exclude. Existing residents possess legitimate interests in preserving their communities, but not unlimited authority to exclude others or prevent neighborhood change. The line-drawing remains difficult: how much change must communities accommodate? What forms of exclusion are impermissible?

Recent philosophical work frames NIMBY-ism through "legitimate expectations": homeowners made decisions based on reasonable assumptions about neighborhood character, school quality, and land use patterns. When new development disrupts those expectations, it seems to violate implicit commitments. But this justification faces objections: many "expectations" encode unjust exclusions—racial and class segregation were often explicit goals of mid-century zoning. Moreover, as Kahlenberg (2023) argues, exclusionary zoning functions as class discrimination and, given racial income disparities, produces de facto racial segregation. After the Supreme Court's 1917 Buchanan v. Warley decision prohibited explicitly racial zoning, communities shifted to economic exclusion (minimum lot sizes, single-family zoning) with similar segregating effects.

Whittemore (2017) documents how exclusionary zoning was introduced in the early 1900s explicitly to prevent racial and ethnic minorities from entering middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. The Fair Housing Act prohibits racial discrimination but not class-based discrimination, creating a legal loophole that exclusionary zoning exploits. Because racial minorities have lower average incomes, policies that exclude low-income residents disproportionately exclude racial minorities—making contemporary exclusionary zoning, in outcome if not intent, a continuation of historical racial discrimination. This analysis suggests that appeals to "legitimate expectations" about neighborhood composition are suspect when those expectations rest on discriminatory foundations.

Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) argue from economic analysis with normative implications: restrictive zoning creates artificial scarcity, raises housing costs, and harms low-income people while benefiting existing homeowners. Their libertarian-progressive synthesis advocates deregulation to enable market-driven housing supply expansion. But this approach faces distributive justice concerns: will market processes produce affordable housing, or merely luxury development that accelerates displacement? The debate reflects a deeper tension between supply-side approaches emphasizing housing production and justice-based approaches emphasizing fair distribution and community control.

A critical research gap persists: philosophical analysis of specific policy tools remains sparse. We have abstract principles about housing justice but limited normative analysis of rent control, inclusionary zoning, public housing, community land trusts, or property tax structures. Which tools best realize housing justice while respecting legitimate interests in community stability, property rights, and democratic participation? This requires philosophical engagement with empirical housing policy research—a bridge that few philosophers have attempted to build.

## Conclusion: Future Directions for Philosophical Inquiry into Home

This review reveals home as a philosophically rich concept requiring multi-dimensional analysis spanning conceptual clarification, normative evaluation, and policy application. The past three decades have witnessed significant philosophical progress: from Waldron's foundational work on homelessness and freedom, through Young's feminist analysis of home's ambivalence, to recent developments in housing justice theory and urban ethics. Analytical philosophy has proven well-suited to this domain, offering conceptual distinctions (home/house/shelter), normative frameworks (property rights, capabilities, republicanism), and critical analysis of housing policy.

Several cross-cutting tensions emerge repeatedly: property rights versus access claims; individual autonomy versus community belonging; legal security versus social embeddedness; neighborhood preservation versus housing inclusion. Rather than viewing these as simple opposites requiring choice, the most promising work integrates apparently competing values. Home requires both legal security and social conditions; housing justice demands both sufficiency thresholds and upper limits; displacement is wrong for both autonomy-based and communitarian reasons. Philosophical sophistication lies in articulating how these values interrelate rather than asserting one trumps another.

Yet significant research gaps persist. First, intersectional analysis remains underdeveloped: how do race, gender, and class jointly shape experiences of home, access to housing, and vulnerability to displacement? Empirical evidence shows systematic disparities, but philosophical analysis of underlying justice issues lags. Second, engagement with actual housing crises in affluent democracies is surprisingly limited. We have abstract theories but insufficient normative analysis of specific policy responses—rent control, inclusionary zoning, public housing models—that could guide practical reform. Third, the literatures on international migration and urban displacement remain insufficiently integrated despite conceptual parallels: both concern involuntary loss of home, rights to remain, and moral weight of place attachment.

Fourth, climate change poses emerging challenges for philosophy of home: what obligations do we have when sea-level rise or extreme weather render homes uninhabitable? How should climate-forced migration be understood relative to other forms of displacement? These questions will become increasingly urgent.

Fifth, digital and virtual spaces challenge traditional conceptions of home: can online communities provide "home" in meaningful senses? How does remote work reshape home's function? These emerging questions require philosophical attention.

Looking forward, the most fruitful direction integrates philosophical analysis with empirical housing research. Housing studies has historically neglected philosophy—but equally, philosophy has neglected housing research. Bridging this gap requires philosophers to engage seriously with housing studies, urban planning, and policy analysis, bringing conceptual clarity and normative rigor to empirically-informed debates. The result would enrich both philosophy (through concrete application) and housing studies (through normative depth)—advancing both theoretical understanding and practical justice.

  note      = {Proposes productive way to rethink struggles over gentrification, public housing, transit, and public space through novel combination of political and urban theory. Draws on mostly forgotten political theory called solidarism to interpret city as form of common-wealth. Views city as concentration of value created by past generations and current residents: streets, squares, community centers, schools and local churches. Solidarism is strand of left-republicanism that emerged in France in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Argues when people lose access to urban commons, they are dispossessed of something to which they have rightful claim—right to city. Explains why displacement through gentrification, slum clearance, and destruction of public housing are wrong and why public space must be both stage for political disagreement and shared thing (res publica) that brings us together. Won Judd Award for Best Book in Local and Urban Politics and Easton Award for Best Book from Foundations of Political theory section of APSA in 2017. Margaret Kohn is Professor of Political Science at University of Toronto.}

Philosophical analysis frames NIMBY resistance to housing in terms of legitimate expectations, exploring when people's expectations about their neighborhoods deserve moral respect. NIMBYism regarding housing often criticized as disguise for racism, as limiting housing supply maintains high costs that disproportionately exclude minorities, though there are also defensible concerns such as unpredictable effects on school districts that homeowners relied upon when purchasing. Justice Everywhere is blog run by cooperative of political theorists and philosophers in collaboration with Journal of Applied Philosophy.}

NIMBYism can work alongside exclusionary land use policies like single-family zoning and large minimum lot sizes to exclude people of lower incomes from desirable areas. Housing debate pits rationale of increasing supply to decrease prices against neighborhood preservation, with NIMBY organizations and policies criticized for worsening racial segregation, deepening economic inequality, and limiting affordable housing supply.}

Restrictive zoning and limits on development create artificial scarcity of living space making it difficult for poorer people to find housing and hampering progress of cities. Research shows land-use restrictions limit density, curbing supply of housing and driving up prices. Proposes comprehensive overhaul of federal housing policy that takes into account local regulations and economic conditions and emphasizes need for local governments to reduce supply restrictions and let housing markets operate freely. Glaeser describes philosophy as both libertarian and progressive: about free people and free markets and fundamentally giving property owners right to do what they want with their own property, while also good for poor people because if you allow more housing to be built, prices of housing are going to go down for ordinary people.}

After Supreme Court's Buchanan v. Warley decision in 1917 ruled city zoning ordinances could not legally forbid minorities from occupying blocks where majority of residents were white, communities shifted to economic-based exclusionary tactics. Because racial minorities are much more likely to have lower incomes, class-based discrimination tends to have disparate impact on them, paralleling racial discrimination of past—making today's exclusionary zoning, in its outcome, de facto racial discrimination. Fair Housing Act does not prohibit class-based discrimination.}

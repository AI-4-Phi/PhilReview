## Validation Methodology

### Search Approach

For each entry, validation included:
1. **WebSearch** for author + title + year
2. **WebSearch** for title + journal/publisher
3. **WebSearch** for DOI (when provided)
4. **WebFetch** to verify DOI resolution (when appropriate)

### Verification Criteria

Entries were kept if:
- Author names matched
- Title matched
- Publication venue verified
- Year approximately correct (±1-2 years acceptable for online-first vs. print)
- DOI valid (if provided) OR clear web evidence of existence

Entries were removed if:
- Author names completely wrong
- Cannot locate paper through multiple search strategies
- Major metadata mismatches
- Evidence of fabrication

### Search Queries Used

Examples of searches performed:
- "Jenkins Brownlee 'What a Home Does' Law and Philosophy 2022"
- "Michael Allen Fox 'Home: A Very Short Introduction' Oxford 2016"
- "Meyers 'Privacy and Housing: Research Perspectives' PMC 2022" → Found wrong attribution
- "Bart van Leeuwen Gentrification Migration doi:10.1080/13698230.2025.2548027" → Found wrong attribution

## Recommendations

### Overall Assessment

**REVIEW COMPLETED**. 5 entries (6%) removed due to verification failures. The remaining 79 verified entries represent a solid foundation for the literature review.

### Next Steps

1. **Proceed to synthesis planning** - Remaining citations are sufficient
2. **Import cleaned BibTeX files to Zotero** - All 7 domain files now contain only verified entries
3. **DO NOT import unverified-sources.bib** - This file is for record-keeping only

### Specific Actions (Optional)

If the removed papers were marked as High importance, consider:

1. **Domain 1 issues**:
   - **privacy2022housing**: Can be re-added with correct authors (de Macedo, Ornstein, & Elali)
   - **smith2015philosophy**: Can be re-added with correct author (Noutsou) and year (2018)
   - **king2004meaning**: May not exist; omit unless alternative citation found

2. **Domain 6 issue**:
   - **vanleeuwen2023gentrification**: Can be re-added with correct author (Lopez-Cantero)

3. **Domain 7 issue**:
   - **gentrification2023philosophical**: Can be re-added with correct author (Lloyd) and year (2023)

### Quality Notes

- **High accuracy on canonical works**: All major foundational works (Waldron, Young, Carens, Malpas, etc.) verified successfully
- **Recent work verification**: Most 2020-2025 works verified through publisher websites
- **Author attribution errors**: The 3 author misattribution errors suggest possible confusion during initial literature gathering
- **DOI coverage**: ~60% of recent articles have DOIs; those that do mostly resolve correctly

## Proceed to Synthesis?

**Status**: CLEARED

The 5 removed citations represent a small fraction (6%) of the total literature base. The 79 verified entries span all 7 domains and include canonical works, recent scholarship, and diverse perspectives.

**Synthesis-planner can proceed** with the cleaned and verified bibliography. The literature review will have high citation integrity.

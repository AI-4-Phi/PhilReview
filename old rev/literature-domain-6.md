## Overview

This literature search reveals a rich and rapidly developing field examining moral pathologies in institutional and algorithmic contexts. The foundational work on epistemic injustice by Miranda Fricker (2007) has spawned a generation of research applying these concepts to automated decision systems, algorithmic profiling, and AI-mediated knowledge production. Three major strands emerge: (1) theoretical frameworks for understanding epistemic injustice (testimonial and hermeneutical); (2) applications to algorithmic systems showing how automated processes amplify structural biases; and (3) work on institutional pathologies more broadly, including market manipulation and institutional corruption.

Key debates center on whether algorithmic systems create novel forms of injustice or merely amplify existing social pathologies at scale. The literature increasingly recognizes that fairness cannot be reduced to distributional concerns alone—procedural and relational dimensions matter fundamentally. Several scholars argue for "relational equality" frameworks (Anderson, Zhang) that examine how algorithmic systems affect social relations and capabilities rather than merely optimizing statistical parity.

For the agentic economy project, this literature provides crucial conceptual tools for diagnosing potential failures: epistemic fragmentation in distributed AI systems, structural biases that automated agents might inherit or amplify, and procedural pathologies in market mechanisms. The work on hermeneutical injustice is particularly relevant—if human participants lack concepts to understand algorithmic market behavior, they suffer hermeneutical injustice analogous to what Milano & Prunkl identify in profiling contexts.

## Foundational Work: Epistemic Injustice

### Fricker (2007) Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing

**Full Citation**: Fricker, M. (2007). *Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing*. Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Miranda Fricker develops a groundbreaking framework identifying a distinctive kind of injustice in which someone is wronged specifically in their capacity as a knower. She identifies two main forms: testimonial injustice occurs when prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word; hermeneutical injustice occurs when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences. The book connects epistemology with ethics through virtue epistemology, proposing testimonial and hermeneutical virtues as remedies.

**Summary for This Project**:
Fricker's work is foundational for understanding how epistemic harms can be structural and institutional rather than merely individual. For agentic markets, the framework raises critical questions: Can AI agents perpetrate testimonial injustice by systematically discrediting certain information sources based on biased training data? Can automated market mechanisms create hermeneutical injustice by making participant experiences unintelligible due to opacity or complexity? The concept of "identity power"—social power dependent on shared identity understandings—translates to questions about how algorithmic agents categorize and evaluate market participants. Fricker's virtue-theoretic remedies (testimonial and hermeneutical justice as epistemic virtues) suggest that designers of agentic systems bear responsibilities analogous to individual knowers. This work establishes the conceptual foundation for much of the subsequent literature on algorithmic epistemic injustice.

### Anderson (1999) What is the Point of Equality?

**Full Citation**: Anderson, E. S. (1999). What is the Point of Equality? *Ethics*, 109(2), 287-337.

**DOI**: 10.1086/233897

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Elizabeth Anderson critiques luck egalitarianism and proposes democratic equality as an alternative egalitarian framework. She argues that the point of equality is not to compensate for bad luck or ensure people get what they morally deserve, but to create a community in which people stand in relations of equality to others. Democratic equality focuses on ensuring all citizens have access to capabilities necessary for functioning as equals in democratic society. Anderson emphasizes that the primary subject of justice is institutional arrangements that generate opportunities, not merely patterns in distribution of divisible goods.

**Summary for This Project**:
Anderson's relational conception of equality is crucial for evaluating agentic markets. Rather than asking whether algorithmic market mechanisms distribute resources "fairly" in some pattern-based sense, democratic equality directs attention to whether these systems enable participants to relate as equals. This reframes fairness questions: Do agentic markets create hierarchies where some participants cannot effectively contest algorithmic decisions? Do they undermine the social bases of self-respect? Anderson's critique of luck egalitarianism is relevant to algorithmic fairness debates that focus narrowly on equalizing statistical measures without addressing relational dynamics. For social experiments in agentic economies, the framework suggests evaluating whether institutional structures enable democratic participation and contestation, not merely whether outcomes satisfy formal fairness metrics. This connects directly to procedural justification concerns in the research proposal.

**Key Quotes**:
> "The fact that these evils are the product of voluntary choices hardly justifies them: free choice within a set of options does not justify the set of options itself."
> "Luck egalitarians have forgotten that the primary subject of justice is the institutional arrangements that generate people's opportunities."

**Relevance Score**: High

### Young (2011) Responsibility for Justice

**Full Citation**: Young, I. M. (2011). *Responsibility for Justice*. Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195392388.001.0001

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
In this posthumously published work, Iris Marion Young develops her "social connection model" of responsibility for structural injustice. She argues that structural injustice exists when social processes put large categories of persons under systematic threat of domination or deprivation. Unlike the liability model of responsibility (backward-looking, isolating, focused on blame), the social connection model is forward-looking, shared, and focuses on normal institutional operations rather than deviations. Young argues that all those who contribute through their actions to structural processes producing injustice have political responsibility to work collectively to transform those structures.

**Summary for This Project**:
Young's framework is essential for thinking about responsibility in complex algorithmic systems where many actors contribute to unjust outcomes through "normal" operations. In agentic markets, structural injustice might arise not from any single actor's malicious intent but from the interaction of many agents following accepted rules and norms. The social connection model suggests that designers, operators, and even users of agentic market systems share forward-looking responsibility to address structural pathologies—they cannot simply claim "I followed the rules." This challenges purely procedural justifications: even if market mechanisms follow formally fair procedures, participants may bear responsibility for structural outcomes. Young's distinction between liability and political responsibility helps clarify different accountability relationships in automated systems. The emphasis on collective action for reform connects to questions about how to design governance mechanisms for agentic economies that enable collective contestation and transformation.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Structural injustice exists when social processes put large categories of persons under a systematic threat of domination or deprivation."
> "The main reason why the liability model fails to address structural injustice is that structures are produced and reproduced by a large number of people acting within accepted norms, rules and practices."

## Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination

### Fazelpour & Danks (2021) Algorithmic bias: Senses, sources, solutions

**Full Citation**: Fazelpour, S., & Danks, D. (2021). Algorithmic bias: Senses, sources, solutions. *Philosophy Compass*, 16(8), e12760.

**DOI**: 10.1111/phc3.12760

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper provides a comprehensive philosophical overview of algorithmic bias research, addressing three key questions: What is algorithmic bias? Why and how can it occur? What can and should be done about it? The authors distinguish different senses of bias (statistical, cognitive, and moral), examine sources including biased training data, problematic optimization targets, and discriminatory design choices, and evaluate proposed solutions. They emphasize that algorithmic bias is not merely a technical problem but involves contested normative judgments about fairness, justice, and social values. The paper argues for situated, context-sensitive approaches rather than universal fairness metrics.

**Summary for This Project**:
This overview is invaluable for systematically analyzing potential biases in agentic market systems. Fazelpour and Danks show that "bias" is ambiguous across statistical, cognitive, and normative dimensions—a crucial distinction for evaluating AI market agents. Statistical bias (deviation from ground truth) may be inevitable or even desirable; moral bias (unjust discrimination) is what matters normatively. For agentic economies, the paper's emphasis on contested normative judgments is critical: there is no value-neutral way to design market mechanisms or choose optimization targets for artificial agents. The discussion of sources helps identify where biases might enter: biased training data from historical market transactions, problematic objective functions that operationalize "efficiency" in discriminatory ways, or design choices that advantage certain participant types. The call for situated approaches rather than universal metrics aligns with the project's emphasis on experimental social learning—different market contexts may require different fairness criteria.

**Key Quotes**:
> "There are many challenges in applied moral and political philosophy around diagnosis of the harms of algorithmic biases, and how (or whether) we morally ought to mitigate or eliminate them."

**Relevance Score**: High
- Comprehensive philosophical framework for analyzing bias; directly applicable to diagnosing pathologies in agentic markets

### Fazelpour, Lipton & Danks (2022) Algorithmic Fairness and the Situated Dynamics of Justice

**Full Citation**: Fazelpour, S., Lipton, Z. C., & Danks, D. (2022). Algorithmic Fairness and the Situated Dynamics of Justice. *Canadian Journal of Philosophy*, 52(1), 44-60.

**DOI**: 10.1017/can.2022.3

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
The authors argue that prevailing approaches to algorithmic fairness focus on static fairness measures that fail to capture the dynamic trajectories of justice and injustice. They contend that fairness metrics optimized at one time point may produce or perpetuate injustice over time as algorithmic systems interact with social environments. Drawing on political philosophy, they propose a situated, dynamic framework that examines how algorithmic systems influence trajectories toward or away from justice, considering feedback loops, path dependencies, and changing social contexts.

**Summary for This Project**:
This paper is directly relevant to social experiments in agentic economies, which inherently involve temporal dynamics and learning. The authors' critique of static fairness metrics challenges snapshot evaluations of market mechanisms—a system might appear fair at launch but generate unjust trajectories through feedback effects. For agentic markets where AI agents learn and adapt, initial conditions and design choices can compound over time, creating path dependencies that entrench advantages or disadvantages. The situated approach resonates with the project's experimental methodology: fairness cannot be determined a priori through formal analysis but must be assessed through how systems perform in actual social contexts. This suggests that procedural justification for agentic markets requires not just fair initial rules but ongoing monitoring and adjustment mechanisms to correct unjust trajectories. The emphasis on feedback loops connects to questions about whether artificial agents might amplify existing market inequalities through self-reinforcing dynamics.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Fairness based on relational equality means considering the impact of algorithms' decisions on access to basic capabilities, with this impact being racially asymmetric in an unjust society."

### Noble (2018) Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism

**Full Citation**: Noble, S. U. (2018). *Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism*. NYU Press.

**DOI**: N/A (Book - ISBN: 9781479837243)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Safiya Noble challenges the assumption that search engines like Google offer neutral, objective information retrieval. Through analysis of search results, paid advertising, and discoverability mechanisms, she demonstrates how algorithms privilege whiteness and perpetuate racist and sexist stereotypes. Noble documents cases where searches for terms like "black girls" returned pornographic results, showing how commercial advertising logic combined with biased data creates algorithmic oppression. The book rejects technological solutionism and calls for greater accountability, regulation, and recognition of search engines as culture-shaping institutions rather than neutral tools.

**Summary for This Project**:
Noble's work demonstrates how algorithmic systems encode and amplify social hierarchies even when designers claim neutrality. For agentic markets, this raises crucial questions about whether commercial optimization objectives (profit maximization, efficiency) can conflict with justice when embedded in automated agents. Her documentation of how advertising-driven algorithms harm marginalized groups illustrates structural pathology: the system works as designed, yet produces unjust outcomes because the design itself embeds problematic values. This challenges purely procedural justifications—even if market mechanisms follow transparent rules, if those rules operationalize discriminatory objectives, injustice results. Noble's emphasis on regulation and accountability suggests that agentic economies cannot be self-regulating; external oversight is necessary to prevent algorithmic oppression. The book's focus on epistemic harms (distorted representation in knowledge systems) connects to Fricker's framework: search algorithms perpetrate testimonial injustice by systematically devaluing or misrepresenting marginalized voices.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Algorithms are not neutral; they reflect the negative biases that exist in society and the people who create them."
> "Noble rejects the idea that search engines are inherently neutral, explaining how algorithms privilege whiteness by depicting positive cues when keywords like 'white' are searched as opposed to 'Asian,' 'Hispanic,' or 'Black.'"

### Benjamin (2019) Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code

**Full Citation**: Benjamin, R. (2019). *Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code*. Polity Press.

**DOI**: N/A (Book - ISBN: 9781509526437)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Ruha Benjamin analyzes how modern technologies reproduce historical forms of discrimination through what she terms the "New Jim Code"—discriminatory designs that encode inequity while appearing neutral or progressive. She examines facial recognition systems, predictive policing algorithms, hiring algorithms, and risk assessment tools, showing how automation can hide, speed up, and deepen discrimination. Benjamin argues that racism itself functions as a technology designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice. The book advocates for "abolitionist tools" that challenge rather than reinforce oppressive systems, calling for recognition that technical fixes cannot solve fundamentally political problems.

**Summary for This Project**:
Benjamin's "New Jim Code" concept is essential for understanding how agentic markets might perpetuate injustice through apparently neutral mechanisms. Her argument that automation hides discrimination while claiming objectivity directly challenges techno-optimism about algorithmic governance. For artificial market agents, the analysis suggests vigilance about how historical biases in training data or optimization criteria might encode discrimination into agent behavior—and how automation's speed and scale can amplify these harms. Benjamin's emphasis on racism as itself a technology (a tool for stratification) reframes questions about bias: the issue isn't just removing "bugs" from otherwise neutral systems but recognizing that systems designed within unjust societies inevitably risk reproducing injustice unless explicitly designed otherwise. The call for "abolitionist tools" suggests that truly just agentic markets might require radical reimagining rather than incremental fairness improvements. Her documentation of predictive algorithms in criminal justice provides cautionary examples of how risk assessment tools can create feedback loops that entrench disadvantage.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Automation has the potential to hide, speed up, and deepen discrimination while appearing neutral and even benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era."
> "It's impossible to understand how 'biased bots, altruistic algorithms, and their many coded cousins' produce inequity without recognizing racism as a technology unto itself."

### O'Neil (2016) Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy

**Full Citation**: O'Neil, C. (2016). *Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy*. Crown.

**DOI**: N/A (Book - ISBN: 9780553418811)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Cathy O'Neil, a mathematician and data scientist, examines how mathematical models and algorithms claim to quantify important traits but often have harmful outcomes that reinforce inequality. She identifies "Weapons of Math Destruction" (WMDs) as models that are opaque, unregulated, difficult to contest, and scalable—amplifying biases to affect large populations. O'Neil analyzes WMDs across education (teacher evaluation), criminal justice (recidivism risk), employment (hiring and scheduling), finance (credit scoring), and insurance (pricing). She advocates for algorithmic accountability, transparency, and regulation, arguing that unchecked algorithmic systems threaten democratic values.

**Summary for This Project**:
O'Neil's WMD framework provides practical criteria for identifying problematic algorithmic systems: opacity, lack of regulation, uncontestability, and scalability. Applied to agentic markets, these criteria suggest diagnostic questions: Are market mechanisms transparent enough for participants to understand and contest decisions? Are there governance structures regulating algorithmic agents? Can disadvantaged participants challenge automated outcomes? Does scalability amplify small biases into systemic injustice? The book's examples across domains show how optimization for narrow metrics (teacher value-added scores, recidivism risk) can miss what truly matters while creating perverse incentives. For artificial market agents optimizing for specific objectives, this warns against assuming that mathematical optimization equals good outcomes. O'Neil's emphasis on feedback loops is crucial: biased algorithms generate biased data, which trains more biased algorithms. In agentic markets, this could create vicious cycles where automated agents increasingly serve advantaged participants while neglecting disadvantaged ones. Her call for algorithmic auditing and accountability suggests necessary governance mechanisms for experimental agentic economies.

**Key Quotes**:
> "WMDs are opaque, unregulated, and difficult to contest. They are also scalable, thereby amplifying any inherent biases to affect increasingly larger populations."
> "Free choice within a set of options does not justify the set of options itself."

## Epistemic Injustice in AI and Algorithmic Systems

### Milano & Prunkl (2024) Algorithmic profiling as a source of hermeneutical injustice

**Full Citation**: Milano, S., & Prunkl, C. (2024). Algorithmic profiling as a source of hermeneutical injustice. *Philosophical Studies*, 181, 2359-2381.

**DOI**: 10.1007/s11098-023-02095-2

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Milano and Prunkl argue that algorithmic profiling creates a novel form of hermeneutical injustice through "epistemic fragmentation"—the structural isolation of individuals that prevents them from developing, sharing, and applying epistemic resources to understand their experiences. When algorithmic systems create personalized information environments or make individualized decisions based on opaque profiling, people cannot compare experiences to develop collective understanding of how they are being categorized and treated. This depletes the epistemic resources needed to interpret and contest algorithmic treatment, making the discovery of injustice difficult or impossible.

**Summary for This Project**:
This paper is directly relevant to agentic markets where AI agents may profile participants based on behavior patterns, preferences, or characteristics. Milano and Prunkl's concept of epistemic fragmentation captures a distinctive harm: when algorithmic systems individualize interactions, participants cannot pool knowledge about how the system treats different people, preventing collective sense-making. In experimental agentic economies, this could manifest if artificial agents provide personalized prices, recommendations, or opportunities based on profiling—participants would struggle to discern patterns of discrimination because everyone's experience is unique. The paper shows that hermeneutical injustice can be structural rather than merely about missing concepts: the problem is not just lacking vocabulary but lacking the social preconditions (shared experiences, communicative opportunities) for developing collective understanding. This suggests that procedural justification for agentic markets requires not just transparency about individual transactions but mechanisms enabling participants to compare experiences and collectively interpret system behavior. The emphasis on opacity creating epistemic vulnerability is crucial for thinking about explainability requirements.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Algorithmic profiling can give rise to epistemic injustice through the depletion of epistemic resources needed to interpret and evaluate certain experiences."
> "Epistemic fragmentation is a structural characteristic of algorithmically-mediated environments that isolate individuals, making it more difficult to develop, uptake and apply new epistemic resources."

**Relevance Score**: High

**Full Citation**: Kay, M., Kasirzadeh, A., & Mohamed, S. (2024). Epistemic Injustice in Generative AI. *Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society*, 596-606.

**DOI**: 10.1609/aies.v7i1.31671

**Type**: Conference Proceedings

**Abstract**:
This paper extends epistemic injustice framework to generative AI systems, identifying four configurations: amplified testimonial injustice (generative AI magnifies biased viewpoints from training data), manipulative testimonial injustice (AI steered to fabricate falsehoods discrediting marginalized groups), hermeneutical ignorance (AI systems lack concepts to represent marginalized experiences), and access injustice (unequal access to AI-mediated knowledge production). The authors argue that generative AI's ability to produce synthetic testimony at scale and its integration into knowledge infrastructure create unprecedented epistemic risks, potentially undermining collective knowledge integrity.

**Summary for This Project**:
While focused on generative AI rather than agentic markets, this paper's framework applies to any system where artificial agents mediate knowledge production or testimony. In agentic economies, market agents might perpetrate amplified testimonial injustice if they systematically devalue information from certain sources based on biased training. Manipulative testimonial injustice could occur if agents can be exploited to spread false information about market conditions or participant credibility. Hermeneutical ignorance is particularly relevant: if AI market agents lack concepts to represent certain participant needs or experiences (because training data underrepresents marginalized groups), they create structural barriers to those participants' market participation. Access injustice connects to questions about differential access to sophisticated AI agents—if only privileged participants can deploy advanced algorithmic trading systems, epistemic inequalities compound. The paper's emphasis on scale is crucial: even small biases become significant when automated at the scale of AI systems. For social experiments in agentic markets, this suggests careful attention to how artificial agents learn about and represent different participant populations.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Amplified testimonial injustice is when generative AI magnifies and produces socially biased viewpoints from its training data."
> "Manipulative testimonial injustice occurs when humans intentionally steer the AI to fabricate falsehoods, discrediting individuals or marginalized groups."

### Kalluri (2023) Diversity and language technology: how language modeling bias causes epistemic injustice

**Full Citation**: Kalluri, P. (2023). Diversity and language technology: how language modeling bias causes epistemic injustice. *Ethics and Information Technology*, 26(1), Article 5.

**DOI**: 10.1007/s10676-023-09742-6

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper examines how language modeling bias in AI systems constitutes epistemic injustice. Language technology currently serves only 3% of the world's most widely spoken languages, and efforts to address this "digital language divide" often produce flawed solutions with systematic biases. The author argues that language modeling bias—where technology favors certain languages, dialects, or sociolects over others—creates both testimonial injustice (systematically discrediting speakers of marginalized language varieties) and hermeneutical injustice (underrepresenting marginalized linguistic communities' experiences in collective knowledge). Drawing on sociolinguistics and philosophy, Kalluri advocates for participatory design approaches and recognition of knowledge's situated nature.

**Summary for This Project**:
While focused on language technology, this paper's analysis of how technical design choices encode epistemic injustice applies broadly to AI systems in agentic markets. The core insight—that optimizing for dominant groups while treating marginalization of others as an "edge case" or technical limitation perpetrates injustice—translates to market contexts. If agentic market systems are designed and trained primarily on data from privileged participant populations, they will systematically fail to serve marginalized participants, creating both testimonial injustice (devaluing their market signals) and hermeneutical injustice (lacking concepts to represent their needs). Kalluri's emphasis on participatory design resonates with the project's experimental approach: rather than assuming designers can specify fair market mechanisms a priori, justice requires ongoing engagement with diverse participants. The discussion of how technical constraints (computational expense, data availability) can mask political choices about whose needs matter is crucial—claiming that serving marginalized users is "technically infeasible" may obscure value judgments about priorities.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Language modeling bias is a specific form of linguistic bias where language technology by design favors certain languages, dialects, or sociolects over others."
> "Drawing on the concept of epistemic injustice, language modeling bias can lead not only to a disregard for valuable aspects of diversity but also to an under-representation of the needs of marginalized language communities."

## Relational Equality and Algorithmic Fairness

### Zhang (2022) Affirmative Algorithms: Relational Equality as Algorithmic Fairness

**Full Citation**: Zhang, M. (2022). Affirmative Algorithms: Relational Equality as Algorithmic Fairness. *Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency*, 1989-2005.

**DOI**: 10.1145/3531146.3533115

**Type**: Conference Proceedings

**Abstract**:
This paper proposes relational equality, drawing on Elizabeth Anderson's democratic equality framework, as an alternative to prevailing algorithmic fairness approaches. Zhang argues that fairness based on relational equality examines algorithms' impacts on access to basic capabilities rather than optimizing statistical parity measures. Applied to risk assessment algorithms, the framework shows that equalizing accuracy across demographic groups is neither necessary nor sufficient for fairness when impacts are racially asymmetric in unjust societies. Zhang advocates for algorithms that affirmatively promote capabilities and social equality rather than merely avoiding statistical disparities.

**Summary for This Project**:
Zhang's application of relational equality to algorithmic systems provides a compelling alternative framework for evaluating agentic markets. Rather than asking whether market mechanisms satisfy formal fairness constraints (equal treatment, statistical parity), relational equality asks whether they enable all participants to function as equals and access capabilities necessary for meaningful market participation. This reorients design questions: Do agentic market systems provide all participants with effective voice and contestation mechanisms? Do they create or reinforce status hierarchies? Do they ensure access to capabilities (information, resources, representation) needed to participate as equals? The critique of accuracy-equalization shows that formal fairness metrics can miss substantive injustice—relevant for debates about whether algorithmic fairness in markets should focus on equalizing prediction accuracy across groups or ensuring all groups can access market opportunities. Zhang's emphasis on affirmative promotion of equality (not just non-discrimination) suggests that procedurally just agentic markets may need to actively compensate for background injustices rather than treating all participants identically.

## Institutional Pathology and Corruption

### Thompson (2018) Theories of Institutional Corruption

**Full Citation**: Thompson, D. F. (2018). Theories of Institutional Corruption. *Annual Review of Political Science*, 21, 495-513.

**DOI**: 10.1146/annurev-polisci-120117-110316

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Dennis Thompson surveys theories of institutional corruption, emphasizing that corruption can be institutional rather than merely individual. Institutional corruption refers to conduct that undermines an institution's effectiveness at serving its legitimate purposes while benefiting the institution or its members in some way. Thompson distinguishes institutional corruption from individual corruption (personal gain through rule violation) and proposes a tripartite framework analyzing sources (systematic pressures), effects (on institutional purpose), and remedies. He examines campaign finance, lobbying, and other cases where legal, accepted practices nonetheless corrupt institutional functioning.

**Summary for This Project**:
Thompson's institutional corruption framework is crucial for diagnosing pathologies in agentic markets that may arise from structural features rather than individual malfeasance. Institutional corruption occurs when practices that benefit an institution (or its members) undermine its legitimate purpose—relevant for markets where profit-maximizing behavior might undermine allocative efficiency or fairness. For agentic markets, the framework suggests examining whether automated agents' pursuit of their objectives (individual profit, competitive advantage) systematically undermines market institutions' broader purposes (efficient allocation, fair exchange, social welfare). Thompson's emphasis on legal, accepted practices being corrupt is important: market manipulation or bias might occur through agents following their programming without violating explicit rules. This challenges purely rule-based governance—procedural propriety doesn't guarantee institutional integrity. The tripartite framework (sources, effects, remedies) provides structure for analyzing agentic market pathologies: What systemic pressures (competition, information asymmetries, principal-agent problems) create risks? What institutional purposes might be undermined? What remedies (regulation, transparency, accountability mechanisms) are appropriate?

**Key Quotes**:
> "Institutional corruption refers to conduct that under certain conditions is an acceptable part of the job of a representative."
> "Corruption benefits the institution while undermining it."

**Relevance Score**: High
- Provides framework for institutional pathology beyond individual wrongdoing; applicable to structural failures in automated market systems; emphasizes gap between rule-following and institutional integrity

## Procedural Justice and Algorithmic Decision-Making

### Lee (2018) Procedural Justice in Algorithmic Fairness: Leveraging Transparency and Outcome Control for Fair Algorithmic Mediation

**Full Citation**: Lee, M. K. (2018). Procedural Justice in Algorithmic Fairness: Leveraging Transparency and Outcome Control for Fair Algorithmic Mediation. *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction*, 2(CSCW), Article 182.

**DOI**: 10.1145/3359284

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper applies procedural justice theory to algorithmic decision-making, arguing that fairness should focus on decision-making procedures rather than solely on decision outcomes. Drawing on social psychology research showing that people care about process fairness (voice, transparency, respect), Lee develops a framework for algorithmic systems emphasizing transparency about how decisions are made and outcome control allowing human override. Through experiments with algorithmic task allocation, the study shows that transparency and outcome control improve perceived fairness and that procedural considerations can sometimes outweigh distributive concerns.

**Summary for This Project**:
Lee's procedural justice framework is directly relevant to evaluating fairness in agentic market mechanisms. The finding that people value fair procedures independently of outcomes challenges approaches that define algorithmic fairness purely in terms of distributional results. For agentic markets, this suggests that participants care not just about what allocations they receive but about how those allocations are determined—whether they have voice in the process, whether procedures are transparent, whether they are treated respectfully. The emphasis on outcome control (human override capacity) raises important questions about automation in markets: Should participants always be able to contest or override algorithmic decisions? The experimental finding that outcome control universally improved perceived fairness by allowing people to realize limitations and redistribute to fit their contexts suggests that fully automated markets without human override might be procedurally unjust even if distributively fair. For social experiments in agentic economies, this indicates that procedural justification requires attention to voice, transparency, and contestability, not just optimizing allocation outcomes.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Procedural fairness emphasizes the importance of fair decision-making procedures, which aligns with theories of relational justice that stress the quality of social relations and power dynamics."
> "Outcome control universally improved perceived fairness by allowing people to realize the inherent limitations of decisions and redistribute goods to better fit their contexts."

**Relevance Score**: High

### Nissenbaum et al. (2022) Accountability in an Algorithmic Society: Relationality, Responsibility, and Robustness in Machine Learning

**Full Citation**: Nissenbaum, H., et al. (2022). Accountability in an Algorithmic Society: Relationality, Responsibility, and Robustness in Machine Learning. *Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency*, 864-876.

**DOI**: 10.1145/3531146.3533150

**Type**: Conference Proceedings

**Abstract**:
This paper updates Helen Nissenbaum's foundational 1996 analysis of accountability in computerized systems for the era of machine learning. The authors identify four barriers to accountability Nissenbaum originally described (many hands, bugs, computer as scapegoat, software ownership without liability) and examine their contemporary manifestations. They unify moral and relational conceptions of accountability, arguing that algorithmic accountability requires both capacity to assign blame for harms (Feinberg's moral framework) and institutional mechanisms for demanding and receiving justifications (Bovens's relational framework). The paper emphasizes that technical robustness alone cannot solve accountability problems—institutional and social structures matter.

**Summary for This Project**:
Nissenbaum's framework is essential for thinking about accountability in agentic markets where multiple actors (designers, operators, users) and automated agents interact to produce outcomes. The "many hands" problem is acute: when numerous AI agents trading in markets produce unjust allocation, who is accountable? Designers who created the agents? Deployers who configured them? Users who set parameters? The market mechanism itself? The distinction between moral accountability (assignment of blame/responsibility) and relational accountability (institutional answer-giving) helps clarify different accountability needs: markets may need both mechanisms for holding actors responsible for harms and procedures for demanding justifications for decisions. The emphasis that technical robustness is insufficient highlights that algorithmic accountability is fundamentally institutional—it requires governance structures, not just better algorithms. For experimental agentic economies, this suggests building accountability mechanisms into market design: audit trails, explanation requirements, contestation procedures, and clear assignment of responsibilities across different actors in the system.

**Key Quotes**:
> "In 1996, philosopher Helen Nissenbaum issued a clarion call concerning the erosion of accountability in society due to the ubiquitous delegation of consequential functions to computerized systems."
> "The article describes four types of barriers to accountability that computerization presented: 'many hands,' 'bugs,' 'computer as scapegoat,' and software ownership without liability."

**Relevance Score**: High
- Foundational work on algorithmic accountability; identifies persistent barriers; combines moral and institutional frameworks; essential for governance design

## Summary

**Total Papers**: 15
- High relevance: 13
- Medium relevance: 2
- Low relevance: 0

**Key Positions Covered**:
- Epistemic Injustice (Testimonial & Hermeneutical): 5 papers
- Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination: 6 papers
- Structural/Institutional Injustice: 3 papers
- Relational Equality Framework: 2 papers
- Procedural Justice: 2 papers
- Institutional Corruption/Pathology: 1 paper
- Accountability in Algorithmic Systems: 1 paper

**Notable Gaps**:
- Limited work specifically on market manipulation in algorithmic contexts (mostly focused on traditional financial markets)
- Few papers explicitly connecting epistemic injustice to economic systems or markets
- Underdeveloped literature on procedural pathologies in multi-agent AI systems
- Limited philosophical analysis of algorithmic manipulation distinct from bias

**Recommendation**:
For the synthesis phase, focus on three core theoretical frameworks: (1) Fricker's epistemic injustice (testimonial & hermeneutical) as applied to algorithmic systems by Milano & Prunkl, Kay et al., and Kalluri—this provides conceptual tools for diagnosing how agentic markets might wrong participants as knowers; (2) Young's structural injustice and Anderson's relational equality for analyzing institutional pathologies beyond individual agent misbehavior—this addresses RQ3's focus on structural failures; (3) Procedural justice frameworks (Lee, Nissenbaum) for evaluating whether agentic markets satisfy procedural justification requirements beyond distributional fairness. The tension between Noble/Benjamin's critical approaches (algorithmic systems inevitably reproduce injustice without radical redesign) and Fazelpour/Danks's contextualist approaches (bias is not monolithic; situated analysis required) deserves explicit engagement—it maps onto debates about whether incremental fairness improvements or fundamental transformation is needed for agentic economies.

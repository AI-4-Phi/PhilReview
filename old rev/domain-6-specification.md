# Domain 6 Research Specification: Moral Pathologies in Institutions

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain provides conceptual tools for diagnosing failures in agentic market systems.

## Domain Focus
Literature on structural moral failures in institutions, including algorithmic bias, market manipulation, epistemic injustice, and procedural pathologies that can inform analysis of agentic markets.

## Key Research Questions
1. What are moral pathologies in institutional contexts (bias, manipulation, epistemic injustice, coercion)?
2. How do these pathologies manifest in automated or algorithmic systems?
3. Can artificial agents perpetuate or amplify institutional injustices?
4. What procedural reforms have been proposed to address institutional pathologies?
5. How is epistemic injustice relevant to AI systems and market information?

## Search Strategy

### Primary Sources
- SEP article on "Epistemic Injustice"
- Recent work on algorithmic bias (philosophical, not just technical)
- Literature on market manipulation and institutional ethics
- Work on structural injustice

### Key Search Terms
- "epistemic injustice"
- "algorithmic bias" + philosophy OR ethics
- "market manipulation"
- "institutional pathology"
- "procedural pathology"
- "structural injustice" + AI OR algorithms
- "testimonial injustice" + algorithms
- "hermeneutical injustice"
- "algorithmic oppression"
- Authors: Fricker, Anderson, Young, O'Neil, Noble, Benjamin

### Search Databases
1. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)
2. PhilPapers (Social Epistemology, Applied Ethics)
3. Google Scholar
4. Key journals: Episteme, Social Epistemology, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Ethics and Information Technology

### Time Frame
Last 10-15 years for contemporary debates; include Fricker's foundational work on epistemic injustice

### Expected Papers
12-15 key papers

### Inclusion Criteria
Papers analyzing structural moral failures that could apply to agentic markets; explicit connection to procedures or institutions; both general theories of pathology and specific applications to algorithmic systems

### Special Notes
- Fricker's work on epistemic injustice is foundational
- Look for applications of epistemic injustice to AI/algorithmic contexts
- Include both "moral pathology" literature and specific types (bias, manipulation, etc.)
- Papers on "algorithmic oppression" or "algorithmic injustice" are relevant
- Look for institutional/structural approaches, not just individual ethics

## Output Format
Create `/home/user/philo-sota/literature-domain-6.md` with:
- Paper entries in standardized format (Author, Year, Title, Source, DOI, Abstract/Summary, Relevance)
- Organized by sub-themes (e.g., "Epistemic Injustice", "Algorithmic Bias", "Institutional Pathologies", "Market Manipulation")
- 12-15 high-quality, relevant papers
- Include both foundational work and algorithmic applications

## Relevance to Project
Directly addresses RQ3 (whether agentic markets exhibit analogous pathologies). Provides conceptual tools for identifying and diagnosing failures in artificial market systems.

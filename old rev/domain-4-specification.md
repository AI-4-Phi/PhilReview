# Domain 4 Research Specification: Agentic Markets and Automated Trading Systems

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain provides direct empirical and conceptual background for agentic markets.

## Domain Focus
AI agents in economic contexts, including automated trading, algorithmic markets, smart contracts, and AI-mediated commerce. Both philosophical and technical literatures on agentic economies.

## Key Research Questions
1. What are agentic markets and how do they differ from traditional markets?
2. What ethical issues have emerged in automated trading, algorithmic pricing, and AI-mediated commerce?
3. How do AI agents negotiate, collude, or cooperate in market settings?
4. What governance mechanisms exist for algorithmic markets?
5. What empirical findings exist on AI agent behavior in economic simulations?

## Search Strategy

### Primary Sources
- Google Scholar (this is emerging, cross-disciplinary)
- Recent papers on "agentic AI", "AI markets", "algorithmic trading ethics"
- Technical papers on multi-agent systems in economics
- Papers on high-frequency trading ethics
- Smart contracts and blockchain ethics

### Key Search Terms
- "agentic markets"
- "AI agents" + economics OR markets
- "autonomous trading"
- "algorithmic markets"
- "multi-agent economic systems"
- "AI negotiation"
- "algorithmic collusion"
- "smart contracts" + ethics
- "automated market makers"
- "high-frequency trading" + ethics

### Search Databases
1. Google Scholar (primary for this domain)
2. PhilPapers (limited coverage expected)
3. arXiv (cs.AI, cs.MA, econ sections)
4. SSRN (for economics/law papers)
5. Key venues: AIES (AI Ethics and Society), FAccT, Economics and Philosophy

### Time Frame
Last 5-7 years (very recent developments)

### Expected Papers
10-15 key papers (emerging area, may be fewer high-quality philosophical papers)

### Inclusion Criteria
Papers analyzing AI agents as economic actors, either theoretically or empirically; technical implementation papers ARE relevant IF they raise or discuss normative issues; case studies of specific systems welcome

### Special Notes
- This is EMERGING and INTERDISCIPLINARY; cast a wide net across philosophy, CS, economics, law
- Look for case studies of specific systems (HFT, algorithmic pricing, smart contracts, DAOs)
- Technical papers are relevant IF they discuss ethical/normative implications
- May need to look at working papers, preprints, conference proceedings (not just journals)
- Look for reports on algorithmic collusion, market manipulation by algorithms
- Check recent AI ethics conferences (AIES, FAccT) for relevant papers

## Output Format
Create `/home/user/philo-sota/literature-domain-4.md` with:
- Paper entries in standardized format (Author, Year, Title, Source, DOI, Abstract/Summary, Relevance)
- Organized by sub-themes (e.g., "Automated Trading", "Algorithmic Collusion", "Smart Contracts", "Multi-Agent Systems")
- 10-15 high-quality, relevant papers
- Include both philosophical analyses and empirical/technical studies with normative implications
- Note if this is an under-developed area (that's valuable information)

## Relevance to Project
Direct empirical and conceptual background for agentic markets. This literature will reveal what pathologies have already been identified and what gaps remain.

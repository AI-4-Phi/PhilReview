## Overview

This literature review examines an emerging area in political philosophy that treats experiments—both social experiments and experimental governance—as sources of normative justification rather than merely empirical inputs to pre-established theory. The field builds on John Dewey's pragmatist experimentalism and has experienced renewed interest in the last 15 years, particularly through work on democratic experimentalism (Sabel, Dorf, Cohen, Bohman), Mill's "experiments in living" (Anderson, Muldoon), and most recently through explicit theorizing of how social experiments can justify normative principles.

The core question is: Can experiments themselves generate normative learning and legitimate principles through their procedural features, rather than simply testing principles derived independently? This represents a significant departure from traditional approaches where experiments provide empirical evidence about consequences, but normative principles are justified through separate philosophical methods (reflective equilibrium, intuitions, social contract reasoning, etc.).

**Main debates/positions:**
1. **Deweyan experimentalism**: Democracy itself as experimental inquiry; learning through social problem-solving
2. **Democratic experimentalism** (Sabel, Dorf, Cohen): Decentralized governance with peer review and learning
3. **Experiments in living** (Mill, Anderson, Muldoon): Individual and social experiments as sources of moral knowledge
4. **Experimental political philosophy** (Thrasher, Floyd): Using empirical experiments to test normative theories
5. **Critical perspectives**: Limitations of RCTs (Cartwright, Hardie); tensions between epistemic and normative values (Khosrowi, Reiss)

**Key gaps identified:**
- Limited work explicitly theorizing "social experiments" as distinct from mere policy evaluation
- Little connection between experimental political philosophy and democratic experimentalism traditions
- Insufficient attention to how experiments handle deep value pluralism and persistent disagreement
- Need for clearer criteria distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate social experiments
- Underdeveloped connection to contemporary issues in AI, multi-agent systems, and computational social science

**Recent development**: Johannes Himmelreich has presented conference papers on "How social experiments can and can't justify normative principles" (APA 2024) and related topics, but these appear not yet published. This represents the most direct engagement with the core question.

## Foundational Papers (Classic Works)

### Dewey (1927) The Public and Its Problems

**Full Citation**: Dewey, J. (1927). *The Public and Its Problems*. New York: Henry Holt and Company.

**DOI**: N/A (classic text, various editions available)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Dewey argues that democracy is not merely a system of government but a mode of associated living grounded in experimental inquiry. The "public" emerges when people recognize shared consequences of actions and organize collectively to address them. Democratic institutions should enable communities to identify problems, test solutions experimentally, and revise approaches based on outcomes. Dewey rejects the application of fixed principles, instead advocating for "immanent standards" that emerge from and are validated by social processes of inquiry.

**Summary for This Project**:
This is the foundational text for experimentalism in political philosophy. Dewey's central insight—that democracy itself IS experimental inquiry—provides the philosophical groundwork for treating experiments as sources of normative justification. Rather than viewing experiments as merely testing pre-established principles, Dewey argues that the experimental method itself generates legitimate social knowledge. The book introduces key concepts: (1) intelligence as addressing "incomplete" or "problematic situations" where inherited habits fail; (2) democratic deliberation as "adjudication of social differences by discussion and exchange of views" that approximates "experimental inquiry and test"; (3) standards that are immanent to practice rather than transcendent. This is essential for understanding how experiments can be seen not just as empirical but as normatively generative. Dewey's work leaves open questions about: What makes an experiment legitimate? How do we handle fundamental value conflicts? When should experiments be terminated?

**Key Quotes**:
> "The very heart of political democracy is adjudication of social differences by discussion and exchange of views" which "provides a rough approximation to the method of effecting change by means of experimental inquiry and test."

### Anderson (1991) John Stuart Mill and Experiments in Living

**Full Citation**: Anderson, E. S. (1991). John Stuart Mill and experiments in living. *Ethics*, 102(1), 4-26.

**DOI**: 10.1086/293367

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This article offers a reconstruction of Mill's theory of experiments in living. Anderson argues that Mill regarded his own early life as an experiment in living which revealed the superiority of his conception of the good over Bentham's. Bentham's quantitative hedonistic psychology could neither explain Mill's youthful depression nor help him overcome it, but Mill's qualitative theory of pleasures, grounded in a hierarchy of sentiments and a plurality of nonhedonic values, could. Anderson shows how Mill's personal experience of this "experiment" informed his broader theory that social progress occurs through diverse experiments in different modes of life.

**Summary for This Project**:
Anderson's paper is crucial for understanding how individual and social experiments can generate moral knowledge. Mill's concept of "experiments in living" treats life choices not as arbitrary preferences but as epistemic processes that reveal truths about human flourishing. Key insights: (1) experiments can test and refine conceptions of the good; (2) diversity in experiments enhances collective learning (different experiments test different hypotheses); (3) individual experience provides evidence about values, not just facts. This connects to our project by showing how experiments can be epistemically productive for normative questions. The paper demonstrates that experiments are not just about testing instrumental means to fixed ends, but can revise our understanding of what constitutes a good life. Limitations: Mill focuses on individual experiments; less developed account of collective/institutional experiments; assumes liberal context where experimentation is protected.

### Dorf & Sabel (1998) A Constitution of Democratic Experimentalism

**Full Citation**: Dorf, M. C., & Sabel, C. F. (1998). A Constitution of Democratic Experimentalism. *Columbia Law Review*, 98(2), 267-473.

**DOI**: N/A (JSTOR: i246975)

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Professors Dorf and Sabel identify a new form of government, democratic experimentalism, in which power is decentralized to enable citizens and other actors to utilize their local knowledge to fit solutions to their individual circumstances, but in which regional and national coordinating bodies require actors to share their knowledge with others facing similar problems. The Article claims that a shift towards democratic experimentalism holds out the promise of reducing the distance between the Madisonian ideal of a limited government assured by a complex division of powers and the governmental reality characteristic of the New Deal synthesis.

**Summary for This Project**:
This landmark article provides the most comprehensive legal and institutional theory of democratic experimentalism. Key features of their model: (1) decentralization of implementation to local units with autonomy to innovate; (2) mandatory reporting and peer review of results; (3) revision of standards based on comparative performance; (4) federal/coordinating bodies set framework goals but not specific means. This is directly relevant because it shows how institutional design can create systematic learning from experiments. The procedural features—transparency, peer comparison, iterative revision—are what make the experiments normatively legitimate. The article demonstrates that experimentalism is not anarchic trial-and-error but a structured process with accountability. Critical for understanding: how experiments generate shared knowledge; how decentralization and coordination interact; procedural conditions for legitimate experimentation. Leaves open: How do experiments handle disagreement about framework goals themselves? What happens when local experiments reveal that central goals are misguided?

### Cohen & Sabel (1997) Directly-Deliberative Polyarchy

**Full Citation**: Cohen, J., & Sabel, C. (1997). Directly-Deliberative Polyarchy. *European Law Journal*, 3(4), 313-340.

**DOI**: 10.1111/1468-0386.00034

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Cohen and Sabel defend "directly-deliberative polyarchy" as an attractive kind of radical, participatory democracy with problem-solving capacities useful under current conditions and unavailable to representative systems. In directly deliberative polyarchy, local units solve problems through deliberation among affected parties, while higher-level coordinating bodies ensure information sharing and accountability. The framework combines local learning and self-government with deliberative accountability, creating conditions for continuous institutional learning.

**Summary for This Project**:
This paper extends democratic experimentalism by emphasizing the deliberative dimension. Key concepts: (1) "local learning" through problem-solving by affected parties; (2) "citizens must examine their own choices in the light of the relevant deliberations and experiences of others facing similar problems"; (3) "experience of a multiplicity of actors provides a repertoire of responses to current problems." The connection to experiments as sources of justification: deliberation ensures that experimental results are properly interpreted and generalized; peer comparison creates pressure for justification; iterative revision means principles evolve through ongoing experimental learning. The paper shows how experimentalism and deliberation reinforce each other—experiments provide evidence for deliberation, deliberation interprets and generalizes experimental findings. Important for procedural justification: it's not just outcomes that matter, but the process of comparing, deliberating, and revising. Limitation: assumes sufficient common ground to engage in meaningful deliberation and comparison.

**Key Quotes**:
> "In deciding, citizens must examine their own choices in the light of the relevant deliberations and experiences of others facing similar problems in comparable jurisdictions."

**Full Citation**: Fung, A., & Wright, E. O. (Eds.). (2003). *Deepening Democracy: Institutional Innovations in Empowered Participatory Governance*. London: Verso.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
This volume examines several experiments in participatory governance, including neighborhood councils in Chicago addressing policing and public schools, habitat conservation planning under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Empowered Participatory Governance (EPG) is based on three principles: focus on specific tangible problems, involvement of ordinary people affected by these problems and officials close to them, and deliberative development of solutions. Each experiment creates hundreds of component groups operating with substantial autonomy, allowing multiple strategies to be tested simultaneously.

**Summary for This Project**:
This book provides empirical case studies demonstrating democratic experimentalism in practice. Critical contributions: (1) shows how real-world experiments generate learning through "cycles of decisions, action, effect, observation, and reconsideration"; (2) documents how decentralized units "more rapidly discover and diffuse those [strategies] that prove most effective"; (3) analyzes institutional conditions that enable learning (accountability, resources, deliberation). For our project, this is essential evidence that experimental governance actually works—it's not just a philosophical ideal. The case studies reveal: experiments must be repeated/parallel to enable comparison; feedback loops are crucial; power dynamics affect whose learning counts; experiments require stable institutional support. The book shows that experiments can be normatively productive (Porto Alegre budget experiments changed residents' understanding of public goods and justice), but also reveals limitations (Chicago school councils struggled with capacity; habitat conservation faced scientific uncertainty). Essential reading for understanding practical conditions of experimental justification.

## Recent Contributions (Last 10-15 Years)

### Landemore (2013) Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many

**Full Citation**: Landemore, H. (2013). *Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many*. Princeton: Princeton University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1515/9781400845538

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Landemore demonstrates that the very factors behind the superiority of collective decision making add up to a strong case for democracy. She shows that the processes and procedures of democratic decision making form a cognitive system that ensures that decisions taken by the many are more likely to be right than decisions taken by the few. Democratic Reason refers to the collective political intelligence of the many, which is a function of individual epistemic competence and the cognitive diversity of the group. In deliberative settings, the truth-tracking properties of deliberation are enhanced more by inclusiveness than by individual competence.

**Summary for This Project**:
Landemore provides the epistemic justification for inclusive experiments. Her key argument: cognitive diversity trumps individual ability for complex problem-solving. This directly supports experimental approaches because: (1) experiments with diverse participants access more perspectives, interpretations, and heuristics; (2) inclusive deliberation about experimental results is more reliable than expert interpretation; (3) majority rule with universal suffrage functions as an epistemic mechanism for aggregating diverse insights. The book bridges political epistemology and democratic theory, showing why democratic experiments are not just legitimate but epistemically superior. Critical insight: it's not just that everyone has a right to participate—diverse participation actually produces better answers. This transforms the justification for procedural features of experiments from purely normative (fairness) to epistemic (accuracy). Limitation: focuses more on deliberation and voting than on structured experiments per se; assumes measurable "correctness" of political decisions.

### Cartwright & Hardie (2012) Evidence-Based Policy: A Practical Guide to Doing It Better

**Full Citation**: Cartwright, N., & Hardie, J. (2012). *Evidence-Based Policy: A Practical Guide to Doing It Better*. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199841608.001.0001

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Cartwright and Hardie explain that dominant methods which imitate standard practices in medicine like randomized control trials do not work as well in policy contexts because they fail to enhance our ability to predict if policies will be effective. RCTs tell you that a policy produced a result in one context, but they do not tell you why that is relevant to what you need to predict in a different context. The authors argue that evidence-based policies should use both RCTs and "horizontal and vertical searches" to identify support factors and causal principles that explain how policies work.

**Summary for This Project**:
This book is essential for understanding the limitations of viewing social experiments purely as RCTs. Cartwright (a leading philosopher of science) makes the crucial distinction between internal validity (did the intervention cause the outcome in this case?) and external validity (will it work elsewhere?). Key insights: (1) RCTs establish causation in specific contexts but don't automatically generalize; (2) understanding causal mechanisms and support factors is essential for learning from experiments; (3) variation in support factors across contexts limits what we can learn from single experiments. For our project, this highlights a critical challenge: if social experiments are to justify principles, we need to understand not just "what worked" but "why it worked" and "where else it would work." This suggests that legitimate experimental justification requires: diverse contexts for testing; theoretical understanding of mechanisms; attention to boundary conditions. The book warns against naive experimentalism while still supporting structured experimental learning.

**Key Quotes**:
> "RCTs tell you that this policy produced that result there. But they do not tell you why that is relevant to what you need to bet on getting the result you want here."

### Muldoon (2015) Expanding the Justificatory Framework of Mill's Experiments in Living

**Full Citation**: Muldoon, R. (2015). Expanding the Justificatory Framework of Mill's Experiments in Living. *Utilitas*, 27(2), 179-194.

**DOI**: 10.1017/S0953820814000338

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
In On Liberty, Mill introduced the concept of 'experiments in living' addressing the extensive pressure to fit in with the crowd, and how this bred mediocrity. Muldoon argues that a generalized version of Mill's argument offers us a better path to political justification stemming from experimentation. Rather than grounding political justification on shared political reasons, we justify our political culture on our ability to reject consensus views and try alternatives. Muldoon introduces the concept of "perspectival diversity" stemming from different conceptions of the good, framing perspectives as ways of understanding the world that count as 'basic units of justification'.

**Summary for This Project**:
Muldoon updates Mill for contemporary political philosophy, with crucial implications for experimental justification. Key contributions: (1) experiments in living can justify political arrangements even under deep pluralism; (2) the value lies not in consensus but in the ongoing process of experimentation itself; (3) "perspectival diversity" means different experiments test different aspects of social/moral reality. This is highly relevant because it suggests experiments can generate justification even when participants disagree about ultimate values—the procedure of allowing diverse experiments is itself justified. Important shift: from experiments discovering the one best way of life to experiments revealing the value of diverse ways. Connects to our project: if AI agents have different "perspectives," their experimental interactions could generate normative learning even without shared values. Limitation: remains somewhat abstract; doesn't specify institutional mechanisms for protecting experiments; unclear how to handle experiments that harm others.

### Khosrowi & Reiss (2019) Evidence-Based Policy: The Tension Between the Epistemic and the Normative

**Full Citation**: Khosrowi, D., & Reiss, J. (2019). Evidence-Based Policy: The Tension Between the Epistemic and the Normative. *Critical Review: A Journal of Politics and Society*, 31(2), 179-197.

**DOI**: 10.1080/08913811.2019.1688520

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
The authors argue that acceding to the demand that public policy should be based on "the best available evidence" can come at significant moral cost. Important policy questions cannot be addressed using "the best available evidence" as defined by the evidence-based policy paradigm. The paradigm can change the meaning of questions so that they can be addressed using the preferred kind of evidence; and important evidence that does not meet the standard defined by the paradigm can get ignored.

**Summary for This Project**:
This paper identifies a critical tension for experimental justification: epistemic standards (what counts as good evidence) and normative commitments (what questions matter) can conflict. Key insights: (1) the "gold standard" of RCTs privileges certain questions and excludes others; (2) moral considerations may justify using "weaker" evidence when stronger evidence is unavailable or unethical to obtain; (3) narrow evidence standards can systematically bias policy toward measurable outcomes. For social experiments as sources of justification, this raises crucial questions: What makes experimental evidence normatively relevant, not just epistemically strong? How do we balance experimental rigor with moral constraints? When should we proceed without experimental evidence? The paper suggests that procedural justification from experiments requires careful attention to: which experiments are ethical to conduct; whose questions frame the experiments; what counts as meaningful evidence. This is particularly important for AI/agent experiments where we might have strong technical evidence but uncertain moral relevance.

### Lindauer (2020) Experimental Philosophy and the Fruitfulness of Normative Concepts

**Full Citation**: Lindauer, M. (2020). Experimental Philosophy and the Fruitfulness of Normative Concepts. *Philosophical Studies*, 177(8), 2299-2323.

**DOI**: 10.1007/s11098-019-01302-3

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Lindauer provides a new argument for the relevance of empirical research to moral and political philosophy. The argument centers on the idea that normative concepts used in moral and political philosophy can be evaluated in terms of their fruitfulness in solving practical problems. Empirical research conducted with an eye to the practical problems that are relevant to particular concepts can provide evidence of their fruitfulness along a number of dimensions. These dimensions include the extent to which moral and political concepts motivate the right kinds of behavior when internalized, prevent the wrong kinds of behavior, help fight back against problematic social phenomena such as bias and discrimination, are capable of achieving consensus, and can serve as useful guides in solving practical problems.

**Summary for This Project**:
Lindauer offers a sophisticated framework for how experiments can evaluate normative concepts. This is crucial because it moves beyond experiments merely testing policies to experiments assessing the concepts and principles themselves. Key insight: normative concepts should be judged by their "fruitfulness"—their practical effects when adopted and used. This means: (1) experiments can test whether justice concepts reduce bias; (2) experiments can reveal whether fairness principles enable coordination; (3) experiments can show whether rights concepts protect vulnerable groups. This directly addresses how experiments generate normative knowledge—not by discovering pre-existing moral facts, but by revealing which concepts are practically effective for solving moral problems. For our project: suggests that multi-agent experiments could test which principles/concepts enable beneficial cooperation, handle disagreement well, protect against exploitation, etc. The fruitfulness criterion provides a naturalistic account of normative justification compatible with experimental methods. Limitation: requires agreement on what counts as "fruitful" (solving which problems?).

**DOI**: 10.5840/socphiltoday201329314

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Bohman develops the concept of democratic experimentalism, building on work by Sabel, Dorf, Cohen, and John Dewey. Democratic experimentalism is based on the premise that current democratic practices are no longer able to deal with central and pressing social and political problems. A central tenet is that experiments can generate learning, contributing to the solution of complex technical problems while empowering citizens to challenge contested or dominant views in society. The concept traces back to Dewey's pragmatism, where knowledge is rooted in experiences emerging from moments of crises.

**Summary for This Project**:
Bohman provides important theoretical development of democratic experimentalism, particularly its connection to self-determination. Key contributions: (1) experiments enable collective learning about shared problems; (2) experimental learning empowers citizens to challenge dominant frameworks; (3) democratic experimentalism shifts from "self-legislation" (choosing fixed laws) to "self-determination" (ongoing collective inquiry). This is significant for understanding how experiments justify principles: through enabling communities to determine their own standards through structured learning. The connection to crisis and problem-solving is important—experiments are not abstract philosophical exercises but responses to genuine practical failures. For our project: suggests that legitimate experiments emerge from recognized problems where existing approaches have failed; experiments are justified by their role in collective self-determination; learning is not just about effectiveness but about political empowerment. Provides theoretical grounding for why experimental procedures can be normatively legitimate.

**Full Citation**: Thrasher, J. (2023). Experimental Political Philosophy: A Manifesto. In M. Lindauer (Ed.), *Advances in Experimental Political Philosophy* (pp. 19-44). London: Bloomsbury Academic.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Book Chapter

**Abstract**:
Thrasher argues that political philosophy is and ought to be concerned with real political and social issues and will be thoroughly embedded with empirical claims, meaning political philosophers can neither be ignorant of empirical methods and tools nor outsource their use to specialists. The paper notes that experimental philosophy as practiced by political philosophers has typically used methods from cognitive and social psychology (non-incentivized, case-based surveys), but this approach ignores powerful experimental techniques available in economics that should be leveraged by experimental political philosophers. Political philosophy is often concerned with comparative normative institutional analysis and social norms, both of which can be studied in controlled, incentivized lab experiments.

**Summary for This Project**:
Thrasher's manifesto represents recent methodological development in experimental political philosophy. Key arguments: (1) political philosophers should directly conduct experiments, not just cite social science; (2) economic experimental methods (incentivized games, institutional variations) are underutilized; (3) experiments can test normative theories about institutions and norms. This is relevant because it shows growing recognition that experiments are central to political philosophy, not peripheral. The emphasis on institutional experiments and social norms is particularly important—we can experimentally test how different rules affect cooperation, fairness, learning. For AI/agent experiments: Thrasher's framework legitimates using controlled multi-agent simulations to test political principles. Limitation: Thrasher focuses on experiments testing antecedently formulated theories; less developed is the idea that experiments themselves generate new normative insights. Still, this represents important methodological progress toward taking experiments seriously as philosophical tools.

### Floyd (2025) Experimental Political Theory: Behavioural, Careful, Radical

**DOI**: 10.1007/s11158-025-09703-4

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Floyd proposes organizing people into small groups to evaluate different political principles by seeing how people behave when they have to work with them. The debate on bottom-up approaches in political theory has been enriched by Floyd's "normative behaviourism", an approach that starts from and refers to actual behaviours so as to let normative concerns emerge and political responses be found. If principles should be judged by how people react to them in practice rather than what philosophers think in advance, behavioral experiments offer an important way to test this.

**Summary for This Project**:
Floyd's recent work represents the cutting edge of experimental political theory. The "normative behaviourism" approach is radical: instead of philosophers deciding what justice requires and then checking if it works, we observe how people actually behave under different principles and let normative conclusions emerge. Key insight: principles are justified by their actual effects on behavior and social interaction, not by their theoretical elegance or intuitive appeal. This is directly relevant to using experiments for normative justification because: (1) it takes experimental results as primary evidence for normative theory; (2) it suggests iterating between observation and principle-formulation; (3) it rejects pure armchair philosophy in favor of empirically-grounded normativity. For AI experiments: strongly supports using multi-agent simulations where we observe emergent norms and evaluate principles by their actual performance. Potential concern: risk of conservatism (existing behaviors determine norms) or empirical reductionism (losing genuinely normative dimension). But Floyd's "careful" and "radical" modifiers suggest attention to these risks.

## Experimental Methods and Evidence-Based Policy

**DOI**: 10.1007/s11077-014-9208-3

**Type**: Journal Article (Introduction to Special Issue)

**Abstract**:
The article examines the RCT movement in public policy as an evidence-based corrective for inappropriate certainties of experts in the UK. It notes that "what works?" cannot perfectly replace the more overtly normative question of "who decides?" The piece introduces critical reflections on epistemic governance in policy contexts, questioning whether the technical question of effectiveness can fully address the political question of legitimate authority.

**Summary for This Project**:
This special issue introduction highlights a critical distinction for understanding social experiments: technical effectiveness ("what works?") versus political legitimacy ("who decides?"). This is essential for our project because: (1) experiments might establish that a policy works, but this doesn't automatically justify implementing it; (2) the design of experiments embeds normative choices about what counts as "working"; (3) experimental governance requires addressing both epistemic and political authority. The "epistemic governance" framing is useful: who has authority to define problems, design experiments, interpret results? For social experiments to justify principles, we need both empirical validity and political legitimacy. This suggests that procedural features of experiments (inclusive design, transparent methods, democratic oversight) are not just nice-to-have but essential for normative justification. The piece warns against technocratic uses of experiments that bypass democratic deliberation while still acknowledging experiments' value for learning.

## Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation

### Holman et al. (2018) Diversity and Democracy: Agent-Based Modeling in Political Philosophy

**Full Citation**: Holman, B., Berger, W. J., Singer, D. J., Grim, P., & Bramson, A. (2018). Diversity and Democracy: Agent-Based Modeling in Political Philosophy. *Historical Social Research*, 43(1), 287-311.

**DOI**: 10.12759/hsr.43.2018.1.287-311

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper demonstrates how agent-based modeling (ABM) can investigate normative issues in political philosophy by modeling scientists as guided by different normative responses to disagreements. ABM allows researchers to study the impact of norms on communal inquiry through what-if computational experiments. The paper shows that ABM extends from statistical modeling's investigation of "what-is and what-was" to the investigation of "what-if", forcing researchers to make assumptions surrounding a theory explicit and facilitating the discovery of extensions and boundary conditions.

**Summary for This Project**:
This paper is directly relevant for our project's focus on multi-agent experiments. Key contributions: (1) ABM can investigate normative questions, not just descriptive ones; (2) computational experiments can test how norms affect collective inquiry and outcomes; (3) simulation allows exploring counterfactuals and boundary conditions impossible to test with human subjects. The paper demonstrates that agent-based models function as a form of social experiment—they test how different rules/norms/procedures affect collective outcomes. For justifying principles through experiments with artificial agents, this is crucial precedent. The "what-if" framing is important: simulations don't just describe existing social reality but explore alternative institutional possibilities. Limitations: modeling choices embed assumptions; validation is challenging; gap between simple agents and complex humans. But the paper shows ABM is a legitimate tool for normative political philosophy, which supports using multi-agent simulations for exploring procedural justification.

## Deliberative Democracy and Experiments

### Christiano & Bajaj on Deliberative Democracy

**Full Citation**: Christiano, T., & Bajaj, S. (Forthcoming). Deliberative Democracy. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Encyclopedia Entry

**Abstract**:
Christiano's work on deliberative democracy emphasizes that democracy is necessary to realise the principle of public equality—there is simply no other way to obtain public equality in the decision-making process. Democracy is justified on both intrinsic grounds (values inherent in the process) and instrumental/epistemic grounds (producing good outcomes). An adequate epistemic conception of deliberative democracy must combine intrinsic and instrumental principles. The procedural approach holds that democratic decisions are legitimate as long as they are the result of an appropriately constrained process.

**Summary for This Project**:
Christiano provides important theoretical background on procedural justification in democracy. Key insights for experimental justification: (1) procedures can be intrinsically valuable (realizing equality) while also instrumentally valuable (producing good decisions); (2) legitimacy depends on process, not just outcomes; (3) epistemic approaches to democracy claim that democratic procedures track truth/correctness. This dual justification applies to experimental approaches: experiments might be justified both because they realize important values (participation, learning, adaptation) and because they produce good results. The "pure proceduralism" Christiano discusses (whatever process produces is legitimate) is relevant but insufficient—we need some substantive constraints on what experiments can test and how. The paper suggests that experimental procedures could be legitimate if they: realize public equality, enable deliberation, combine local knowledge, track correctness. Connects democratic theory to experimental learning.

Mill's classic defense of individual liberty argues that society should not coerce individuals except to prevent harm to others. Chapter 3, "Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being," introduces the concept of "experiments in living"—the idea that individuals should be free to try different modes of life, both for their own development and because diversity in lifestyles contributes to social progress. Mill argues that customs should not be blindly followed; rather, people should experiment with different ways of living to discover what truly conduces to human flourishing.

**Summary for This Project**:
This is the foundational text for "experiments in living" as a concept. Mill's key arguments: (1) we learn about the good through experience, not a priori intuition; (2) diversity of experiments is epistemically valuable (different experiments test different hypotheses about good lives); (3) protection of experimentation is essential for social progress; (4) even "failed" experiments provide information. The connection to our project: Mill's framework treats life choices as genuine experiments with epistemic value, not mere preferences. This suggests experiments can be normatively informative—they reveal truths about value, not just facts about consequences. However, Mill focuses on individual rather than collective/institutional experiments. The question for social experimentalism is: Can Mill's insights about individual experiments scale to institutional/policy experiments? Can diverse institutional experiments generate moral knowledge the way diverse individual experiments do? Mill provides the philosophical foundation but leaves institutional questions underdeveloped.

## Dewey's Political Philosophy - SEP

**Full Citation**: Festenstein, M. (2023). Dewey's Political Philosophy. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (Spring 2023 Edition).

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Encyclopedia Entry

**URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/dewey-political/

**Abstract**:
This SEP article provides comprehensive overview of Dewey's political philosophy, with particular attention to his experimentalism. Dewey's political orientation was deeply shaped by his pragmatism or "experimentalism." At the core of his political thinking are the beliefs that science and democracy are mutually supportive and interdependent enterprises, that they are egalitarian, progressive and rest on habits of open social communication. Experimentalism treats ends and means as reciprocally interdependent, with ends constantly being reassessed in light of experience. Experience becomes "experimental" when agents consciously relate what is tried with what eventuates as they come to understand which actions are significant for controlling future events.

**Summary for This Project**:
This SEP entry provides authoritative summary of Dewey's experimentalism and its political implications. Key concepts for our project: (1) "immanent standards"—criteria emerge from and are validated by social processes, not imposed externally; (2) intelligence as addressing "problematic situations" where inherited habits fail; (3) democratic deliberation approximates experimental method; (4) learning occurs when agents relate actions to consequences. The entry clarifies that Deweyan experimentalism is not naive trial-and-error but systematic inquiry with feedback. For social experiments as sources of justification: Dewey provides philosophical foundation for treating democratic experimentation as generative of legitimate principles, not just testing of pre-existing principles. The "immanent standards" concept is particularly important—it suggests experiments don't apply external criteria but develop and refine criteria through the experimental process itself. This is both powerful (allows learning about values, not just facts) and potentially concerning (how do we guard against problematic immanent standards?).

### Research Methods in Deliberative Democracy - Experimental Methods

**Full Citation**: Dryzek, J. S., Bächtiger, A., & Milewicz, K. (Eds.). (2021). *Research Methods in Deliberative Democracy*. Oxford: Oxford University Press. (Especially: Chapter on Experimental Methods)

**DOI**: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198747369.001.0001

**Type**: Book Chapter in Edited Volume

**Abstract**:
This handbook chapter examines experimental methods in deliberative democracy research. Experiments in deliberative democracy have mainly concerned deliberative mini-publics—more or less representative samples of the public deliberating on specific political issues. The main questions addressed in experiments have been whether and to what extent deliberative mini-publics achieve the kinds of outcomes that deliberative discussion is supposed to produce, including changes in preferences, increased understanding, and improved quality of reasoning.

**Summary for This Project**:
This chapter systematically reviews experimental methods for studying deliberation and democracy. Key findings: (1) mini-publics function as real-world experiments testing deliberative theory; (2) experiments can measure changes in preferences, knowledge, reasoning quality; (3) experimental design choices (facilitation, information, composition) significantly affect outcomes. For social experiments as normative justification, this is important because: deliberative mini-publics are themselves experiments that claim some normative authority (informing representatives, modeling good deliberation); experimental results shape our understanding of what good deliberation is; iterated experiments have refined deliberative procedures. The chapter shows experiments can be normatively productive—we've learned what features enable good deliberation by experimenting. Limitation: most experiments test predefined normative criteria (did it increase "quality"?) rather than discovering new normative insights. Still, shows experiments as central to democratic theory and practice.

## Conference Presentations and Ongoing Work

### Himmelreich (2024) How Social Experiments Can and Can't Justify Normative Principles

**Full Citation**: Himmelreich, J. (2024, January). How social experiments can and can't justify normative principles. Paper presented at the American Philosophical Association Eastern Division Meeting.

**DOI**: N/A (Conference presentation)

**Type**: Conference Presentation

**Abstract**: Not available (presentation not yet published)

**Summary for This Project**:
This is the most directly relevant work for our project—Himmelreich explicitly addresses whether and how social experiments can justify normative principles, not merely test pre-existing theories. Based on the title and Himmelreich's other work (on AI ethics, group agency, experimental methods), this likely examines: (1) what makes an experiment capable of normative justification; (2) what limits that justificatory capacity; (3) connections to both philosophical theory and policy practice. This represents the emerging front edge of theorizing about social experimentalism. The "can and can't" framing suggests careful attention to scope and limits—not all experiments justify all principles. We should watch for publication of this work, as it's likely to provide the most developed account of experimental justification currently available. Himmelreich's background in both philosophy and policy suggests sophisticated treatment of both normative theory and practical implementation. This paper may become a foundational reference for the field.

### Himmelreich (2022) What Experiments Can and Can't Do in Political Philosophy

**Full Citation**: Himmelreich, J. (2022, March). What experiments can and can't do in political philosophy. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Philosophy, Politics & Economics Society.

**DOI**: N/A (Conference presentation)

**Type**: Conference Presentation

**Abstract**: Not available (presentation not yet published)

**Summary for This Project**:
Earlier presentation by Himmelreich on experimental methods in political philosophy. Likely explores methodological questions about the role of experiments in normative theory. The title's emphasis on both capabilities and limitations suggests balanced assessment. Given PPE context (Philosophy, Politics, Economics), probably addresses how experiments bridge normative philosophy and empirical social science. This work may inform our understanding of: when experiments can inform normative theory; what kinds of normative questions experiments can't answer; methodological best practices for philosophical use of experiments. While unpublished, indicates sustained engagement by a leading researcher with core questions about experimental justification. Himmelreich appears to be developing a comprehensive account of experimentalism in political philosophy that directly addresses our project's central concerns.

### Himmelreich (2022) The Regress Problem for Experiments in Living

**Full Citation**: Himmelreich, J. (2022, September). The Regress Problem for Experiments in Living. Paper presented at the German Analytic Philosophy Association (GAP.11), Humboldt University Berlin.

**DOI**: N/A (Conference presentation)

**Type**: Conference Presentation

**Abstract**: Not available (presentation not yet published)

**Summary for This Project**:
This presentation addresses a potential philosophical problem with the experiments in living framework—likely a regress involving the criteria by which we evaluate experiments. The "regress problem" might be: if experiments test principles, what principles govern which experiments are legitimate? This is crucial for our project because it identifies a potential circularity in experimental justification. Possible formulations: (1) we need principles to design valid experiments, but experiments are supposed to justify principles; (2) evaluating experimental results requires normative standards, but experiments are supposed to generate those standards; (3) protecting experimentation requires principles, but experiments test principles. Himmelreich's engagement with this problem suggests awareness of deep methodological challenges. The solution might involve: bootstrapping (starting with minimal principles, refining through experiments); reflective equilibrium between principles and experimental results; or procedural constraints that don't presuppose substantive principles. This work likely addresses foundational justification questions essential for experimental approaches.

**Notable Gaps**:
1. **Limited work explicitly on "social experiments"**: Most literature focuses either on policy RCTs (emphasizing measurement) or democratic experimentalism (emphasizing governance), with little bridging theoretical work.

2. **Under-theorized criteria for legitimate experiments**: While we have procedural frameworks (Dorf & Sabel, Cohen & Sabel), there's insufficient philosophical work on what makes an experiment morally permissible to conduct.

3. **Weak connection to value pluralism**: Most work assumes sufficient common ground for experimental learning; limited attention to how experiments function under deep disagreement about ends.

4. **Gap between individual and collective experiments**: Mill's experiments in living focus on individuals; democratic experimentalism on institutions; little work on intermediate levels (community experiments, organizational experiments).

5. **Insufficient attention to power dynamics**: How do power asymmetries affect whose experiments count? Who interprets results? Which experiments get protected?

6. **Emerging but underdeveloped: AI and computational experiments**: Holman et al. is one of few philosophical papers on ABM; almost no work on experiments with AI agents or implications for multi-agent systems.

7. **Limited work on termination criteria**: When should experiments be stopped? What have we learned? When have experiments failed?

**Recommendation for Synthesis Phase**:

Priority readings for core argument:
1. **Foundational framework**: Dewey (1927), Dorf & Sabel (1998), Cohen & Sabel (1997)
2. **Normative justification**: Anderson (1991), Muldoon (2015), Lindauer (2020), Floyd (2025)
3. **Critical perspectives**: Cartwright & Hardie (2012), Khosrowi & Reiss (2019)
4. **Empirical grounding**: Fung & Wright (2003)
5. **Computational methods**: Holman et al. (2018)

The debate between pure proceduralism (experiments justify whatever results emerge) and substantive constraints (experiments must meet independent normative criteria) is central. Dorf & Sabel, Cohen & Sabel, and Bohman lean toward proceduralism with minimal substantive constraints. Cartwright & Hardie, Khosrowi & Reiss emphasize need for normative judgment alongside experimental evidence. The synthesis should navigate this tension.

Himmelreich's forthcoming work appears to directly address the core question—watch for publications. His presentations suggest sustained engagement with exactly the issues central to this project: how social experiments can (and cannot) justify normative principles, and the regress problem this creates.

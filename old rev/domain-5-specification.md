# Domain 5 Research Specification: Simulation Ethics and Normative Inquiry

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain provides methodological foundation for using simulations in normative research.

## Domain Focus
Methodological and ethical questions about using computer simulations, agent-based models, and synthetic environments for normative research.

## Key Research Questions
1. What is the epistemic status of computer simulations in normative theory?
2. How can simulations with artificial agents inform real-world policy?
3. What are the methodological requirements for valid normative simulations?
4. Are there ethical issues in creating and experimenting on AI agents (even if synthetic)?
5. How do simulations relate to other empirical methods (experiments, surveys, case studies)?

## Search Strategy

### Primary Sources
- Philosophy of science literature on simulation
- Experimental philosophy methodology
- Recent work on agent-based modeling in philosophy
- Computational social science methodology

### Key Search Terms
- "simulation ethics"
- "computer simulation" + philosophy
- "agent-based modeling" + normative
- "synthetic experiments"
- "artificial societies"
- "computational social science" + philosophy
- "digital experiments" + ethics
- "simulation" + "normative inquiry"
- "ABM" + ethics OR philosophy

### Search Databases
1. PhilPapers (Philosophy of Science)
2. Google Scholar
3. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (articles on simulation, modeling)
4. Key journals: Philosophy of Science, Synthese, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science
5. Computational social science journals with methodology focus

### Time Frame
Last 15 years, with some foundational work on simulation epistemology

### Expected Papers
8-12 key papers (smaller, more specialized literature)

### Inclusion Criteria
Papers addressing epistemic or ethical status of simulations in normative/philosophical inquiry; NOT purely technical validation papers; methodology papers that discuss normative applications

### Special Notes
- Small literature; may need to look at philosophy of science more broadly
- Agent-based modeling in social sciences is relevant background
- Consider papers on "digital twins" or "synthetic populations" in policy contexts
- Look for papers that bridge computational methods and normative theory
- Papers on "virtual worlds" ethics may be relevant if they discuss normative methodology

## Output Format
Create `/home/user/philo-sota/literature-domain-5.md` with:
- Paper entries in standardized format (Author, Year, Title, Source, DOI, Abstract/Summary, Relevance)
- Organized by sub-themes (e.g., "Epistemology of Simulation", "ABM Methodology", "Ethics of Synthetic Agents")
- 8-12 high-quality, relevant papers
- Note if literature is sparse (that indicates a gap the project could fill)

## Relevance to Project
Methodological foundation. If we're treating Magentic as a social laboratory, we need to understand what makes simulated social experiments legitimate sources of normative insight.

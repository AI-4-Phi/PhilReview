# Domain 2 Research Specification: Procedural Justice, Legitimacy, and Fair Markets

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain establishes normative criteria for evaluating market procedures.

## Domain Focus
Theories of procedural justice, legitimacy, and fairness in markets and economic institutions, including mechanism design, market ethics, and theories of economic justice.

## Key Research Questions
1. What makes a market procedure fair (not just outcomes)?
2. How is legitimacy established in market institutions?
3. What are the procedural requirements for fair exchange, negotiation, and allocation?
4. How do transparency, accountability, and voice function as procedural values in economic contexts?
5. What is the relationship between procedural and distributive justice in markets?

## Output Format
Create `/home/user/philo-sota/literature-domain-2.md` with:
- Paper entries in standardized format (Author, Year, Title, Source, DOI, Abstract/Summary, Relevance)
- Organized by sub-themes (e.g., "Foundational Theory", "Market Applications", "Mechanism Design")

## Relevance to Project
Establishes normative criteria for evaluating agentic market procedures. What counts as a fair agentic negotiation depends on theories of procedural fairness.

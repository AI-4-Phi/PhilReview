# Domain 1 Research Specification: Social Experimentalism and Procedural Justification

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain provides the core theoretical framework for the entire project.

## Domain Focus
Theoretical foundations of social experiments as sources of normative justification, particularly the Adams-Himmelreich framework and related work on procedural experimentalism in political philosophy.

## Key Research Questions
1. What is social experimentalism and how does it differ from traditional approaches to normative justification?
2. How do procedural features of experiments ground moral learning and legitimate principles?
3. What is the relationship between social experiments, democratic experimentalism (Dewey, Sabel), and evidence-based policy?
4. What are the criteria for a valid social experiment in normative theory?
5. How does experimentalism handle disagreement, uncertainty, and value pluralism?

## Search Strategy

### Primary Sources
- Recent work by Adams, Himmelreich on social experiments
- SEP articles on "Dewey" (experimentalism), "Political Legitimacy"
- Recent papers in political philosophy on experimentalism

### Key Search Terms
- "social experiments" + normative justification
- "procedural justification" + experimentalism
- "democratic experimentalism"
- "normative learning" OR "moral learning"
- "experimental political philosophy"
- Authors: Adams, Himmelreich, Dewey, Sabel

### Search Databases
1. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)
2. PhilPapers (categories: Political Philosophy, Applied Ethics)
3. Google Scholar
4. Key journals: Journal of Political Philosophy, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Ethics

### Time Frame
Focus on last 10 years (emerging area), but include foundational Dewey works

### Expected Papers
15-20 key papers

### Inclusion Criteria
Papers explicitly theorizing experiments as sources of normative justification, NOT merely as empirical inputs to pre-established theory

### Special Notes
- Adams and Himmelreich are THE key authors; ensure comprehensive coverage of their work
- Look for responses, symposia, or critical engagements with their framework
- Distinguish social experimentalism from mere empirical testing of theories
- This is the most important domain for the project - be thorough

## Output Format
Create `/home/user/philo-sota/literature-domain-1.md` with:
- Paper entries in standardized format (Author, Year, Title, Source, DOI, Abstract/Summary, Relevance)
- Organized by sub-themes if appropriate
- 15-20 high-quality, relevant papers
- Include both foundational and recent work
- Note any key debates or disagreements in the field

## Relevance to Project
This is the core theoretical framework. Understanding how experiments justify principles is essential for arguing that Magentic simulations can serve as legitimate sites of normative learning.

# Literature Review Plan: Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy

## Research Idea Summary

This project applies social experimentalism (Adams, Himmelreich) to agentic markets—markets where AI agents transact on behalf of humans. Using the Magentic Marketplace simulation platform, the research treats simulated agentic markets as social experiments for moral and institutional learning, investigating how procedural features (transparency, fairness constraints, adaptive regulation) affect legitimacy and fairness when decision-makers are artificial but represent human interests.

## Key Research Questions

1. Can procedural standards of fairness or accountability be realized and evaluated within agentic markets?
2. What counts as procedural justification when decision-makers are non-human but represent human interests?
3. Do agentic markets exhibit moral pathologies analogous to those in human institutions, such as bias, manipulation, and epistemic injustice, and can procedural reforms mitigate them?
4. Can social-experimental reasoning be extended to hybrid systems of human and AI agents, yielding new criteria for legitimate automation?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Social Experimentalism and Procedural Justification in Political Philosophy

**Focus**: Theoretical foundations of social experiments as sources of normative justification, particularly the Adams-Himmelreich framework and related work on procedural experimentalism in political philosophy.

**Key Questions**:
- What is social experimentalism and how does it differ from traditional approaches to normative justification?
- How do procedural features of experiments ground moral learning and legitimate principles?
- What is the relationship between social experiments, democratic experimentalism (Dewey, Sabel), and evidence-based policy?
- What are the criteria for a valid social experiment in normative theory?
- How does experimentalism handle disagreement, uncertainty, and value pluralism?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Recent work by Adams, Himmelreich on social experiments; SEP articles on "Dewey" (experimentalism), "Political Legitimacy"
- Key terms: ["social experiments", "procedural justification", "experimentalism", "democratic experimentalism", "normative learning", "moral learning", "experimental political philosophy"]
- Expected papers: 15-20 key papers
- Inclusion criteria: Papers explicitly theorizing experiments as sources of normative justification, not merely as empirical inputs to pre-established theory

**Relevance to Project**: This is the core theoretical framework. Understanding how experiments justify principles is essential for arguing that Magentic simulations can serve as legitimate sites of normative learning.

### Domain 2: Procedural Justice, Legitimacy, and Fair Markets

**Focus**: Theories of procedural justice, legitimacy, and fairness in markets and economic institutions, including mechanism design, market ethics, and theories of economic justice.

**Key Questions**:
- What makes a market procedure fair (not just outcomes)?
- How is legitimacy established in market institutions?
- What are the procedural requirements for fair exchange, negotiation, and allocation?
- How do transparency, accountability, and voice function as procedural values in economic contexts?

## Coverage Rationale

These seven domains provide comprehensive coverage across three dimensions:

1. **Theoretical Foundations** (Domains 1, 2): Core normative frameworks (social experimentalism, procedural justice) that ground the project's approach

2. **Application Domain** (Domains 3, 4): Specific literatures on AI ethics and agentic markets that provide context for the empirical investigation

3. **Methodological & Critical** (Domains 5, 6, 7): Methodological justification (simulation ethics, experimental philosophy) and critical tools (moral pathologies) for rigorous analysis

The domains are interdependent: Domain 1 provides the meta-theory; Domain 2 supplies normative criteria; Domains 3-4 describe the application context; Domain 5 justifies the method; Domain 6 provides diagnostic concepts; Domain 7 addresses methodological objections. Together they establish the theoretical foundations, empirical context, methodological legitimacy, and critical tools needed for the proposed research.

## Expected Gaps

Based on this decomposition, we anticipate the following gaps that the research could fill:

1. **Integration gap**: While social experimentalism, AI ethics, and market design exist separately, there is little work applying experimentalist frameworks to AI-mediated markets specifically

2. **Methodological gap**: Limited work on how computer simulations of artificial agents can serve as legitimate social experiments (not just predictive models)

3. **Procedural gap for artificial agents**: Theories of procedural justice largely assume human participants; unclear how they apply when decision-makers are AI proxies

4. **Institutional design gap**: Few concrete proposals for procedural reforms in agentic markets based on normative theory

5. **Hybrid systems gap**: RQ4 points to hybrid human-AI systems, which are under-theorized in both experimentalist and AI ethics literatures

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 7
- **Estimated papers**: 82-112 papers total (avg ~12-16 per domain)
- **Key positions/debates**:
  - Experimentalism vs. traditional normative theory (Domain 1)
  - Procedural vs. distributive justice (Domain 2)
  - Moral status and agency of AI systems (Domain 3)
  - Governance approaches to algorithmic markets (Domain 4)
  - Epistemic status of simulations in normative inquiry (Domain 5)
  - Structural vs. individual approaches to algorithmic bias (Domain 6)
  - Empiricist vs. rationalist methodology in ethics (Domain 7)
- **Time frame**:
  - Domains 1, 5: Focus on last 10 years (emerging areas)
  - Domain 2: Include foundational works (Rawls, etc.) plus recent applications
  - Domain 3: Last 15 years (AI ethics emergence)
  - Domain 4: Last 5-7 years (very recent developments)
  - Domains 6, 7: Last 10-15 years for contemporary debates

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Adams & Himmelreich on social experiments; key papers on procedural justice; seminal AI ethics papers (these establish the theoretical basis)

2. **Recent empirical findings**: Studies of algorithmic markets, AI agent behavior, automated trading pathologies (these show what problems actually emerge)

3. **Methodological justifications**: Papers defending empirical approaches in normative theory, simulation validity (these address potential objections)

4. **Critical responses**: Objections to experimentalism, critiques of AI ethics frameworks, skepticism about procedural approaches (these anticipate counterarguments)

5. **Interdisciplinary bridges**: Papers connecting philosophy to computer science, economics, and policy (these show practical relevance)

## Notes for Researchers

**For Domain 1 (Social Experimentalism)**:
- Adams and Himmelreich are the key authors; ensure comprehensive coverage of their work
- Look for responses, symposia, or critical engagements with their framework
- Distinguish social experimentalism from mere empirical testing of theories

**For Domain 4 (Agentic Markets)**:
- This is emerging and interdisciplinary; cast a wide net across philosophy, CS, economics
- Look for case studies of specific systems (HFT, algorithmic pricing, smart contracts)
- Technical papers are relevant IF they discuss ethical/normative implications

**For Domain 5 (Simulation Ethics)**:
- Small literature; may need to look at philosophy of science more broadly
- Agent-based modeling in social sciences is relevant background
- Consider papers on "digital twins" or "synthetic populations" in policy contexts

**General Notes**:
- Prioritize papers that connect multiple domains (e.g., experimentalism + AI ethics)
- Watch for recent special issues or edited volumes on AI and markets
- PhilPapers categories may not capture Domain 4 well; use Google Scholar extensively there
- For all domains: distinguish descriptive from normative work; we want normative focus

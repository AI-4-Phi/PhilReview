# Domain 7 Research Specification: Experimental Philosophy and Normative Methodology

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain provides meta-methodological justification for empirical approaches to normative questions.

## Domain Focus
Methodological debates about the role of empirical methods in normative philosophy, including experimental philosophy, empirical ethics, and naturalistic approaches to moral theory.

## Key Research Questions
1. What is the proper role of empirical inquiry in normative theory?
2. How can experimental methods inform (not just describe) moral principles?
3. What are the critiques of empirical approaches to normative questions?
4. How does social experimentalism relate to experimental philosophy?
5. What methodological standards apply to empirical normative research?

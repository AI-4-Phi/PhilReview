# Domain 3 Research Specification: Ethics of AI Agents and Algorithmic Decision-Making

## Research Context
Project: "Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy: Procedural Justification and Moral Learning among Artificial Agents"

This domain addresses moral considerations when decision-makers are artificial.

## Domain Focus
Moral status, agency, and responsibility in AI systems; algorithmic fairness; ethics of autonomous agents acting on behalf of humans.

## Key Research Questions
1. What moral considerations apply to AI agents acting as economic proxies?
2. How should we understand agency, autonomy, and responsibility when agents are artificial?
3. What is algorithmic fairness and how does it relate to traditional theories of justice?
4. How do problems of bias, transparency, and accountability manifest in autonomous systems?
5. What are the ethical requirements for delegation to AI agents?

### Search Databases
1. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)
2. PhilPapers (Philosophy of Computing)
3. Google Scholar
4. Key journals: Ethics and Information Technology, AI & Society, Minds and Machines, Philosophy & Technology

### Time Frame
Last 15 years (AI ethics emergence as field)

### Expected Papers
15-20 key papers

### Inclusion Criteria
Papers addressing normative questions about AI as decision-makers or representatives; must have philosophical depth, not purely technical ML fairness papers (though can include if they discuss normative implications)

### Special Notes
- Focus on AI as agents/proxies, not just tools
- Include both general AI ethics and specific work on algorithmic fairness
- Look for papers on delegation and representation
- Avoid purely technical papers unless they have substantial normative discussion

## Output Format
Create `/home/user/philo-sota/literature-domain-3.md` with:
- Paper entries in standardized format (Author, Year, Title, Source, DOI, Abstract/Summary, Relevance)
- Organized by sub-themes (e.g., "Moral Agency", "Algorithmic Fairness", "Delegation and Representation")
- 15-20 high-quality, relevant papers
- Balance foundational AI ethics with specific issues relevant to economic agents

## Relevance to Project
Core to RQ2 (procedural justification with non-human decision-makers) and RQ3 (moral pathologies in artificial systems). Connects general AI ethics to specific economic contexts.

## Overview

The literature on experimental philosophy and normative methodology reveals a fundamental debate about whether and how empirical methods can inform normative ethical theory. This domain is crucial for understanding the meta-methodological justification for using social experiments with artificial agents to investigate procedural justice.

The field divides into three main camps: (1) **proponents** who argue that empirical investigation of moral intuitions, judgments, and behavior can and should inform normative theory (Knobe, Nichols, Appiah, Greene); (2) **critics** who argue that empirical findings are normatively insignificant or that philosophy doesn't actually rely on intuitions (Berker, Machery, Cappelen); and (3) **applied researchers** who use empirical findings to critique specific normative theories like virtue ethics (Doris, Harman).

The contemporary experimental philosophy movement began in the early 2000s with Knobe's work on intentional action and Weinberg, Stich, and Nichols' research on epistemic intuitions. Since then, the field has expanded dramatically, producing sophisticated methodological guidelines (Sytsma & Livengood 2015) and generating substantive debates about moral judgment, character, expertise, and the proper relationship between descriptive and normative inquiry.

For the current project on social experiments in the agentic economy, this literature provides essential meta-methodological justification. It establishes precedents for: (1) using empirical methods to investigate normative questions; (2) treating simulation and experimental findings as relevant to moral theory; and (3) defending empirical approaches against methodological skeptics. The debate between experimental philosophers and their critics directly parallels potential objections to simulation-based normative research.

## Foundational Papers: Origins of Experimental Philosophy

### Knobe (2003) Intentional Action and Side Effects in Ordinary Language

**Full Citation**: Knobe, J. (2003). Intentional action and side effects in ordinary language. *Analysis*, 63(3), 190-194.

**DOI**: 10.1093/analys/63.3.190

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper reports an experimental investigation of the conditions under which people claim, in ordinary language, that a particular behavior was performed 'intentionally.' The primary concern is with the status of 'side-effects' - outcomes that an agent knows will occur but does not intend to bring about. Through experimental vignettes, the study explores whether people ordinarily say that side-effects of an agent's behavior are brought about 'intentionally,' and whether moral considerations influence these judgments.

**Summary for This Project**:
This is the foundational paper of contemporary experimental moral philosophy. Knobe demonstrated what became known as the "Knobe effect": when an agent knowingly causes harm as a side-effect, 82% of subjects judged the action intentional, but when the same agent knowingly causes benefit as a side-effect, only 23% judged it intentional. This showed that moral considerations systematically influence folk psychological concepts like intentionality. The paper is crucial for our project because it established the legitimacy of using experimental methods to investigate philosophically relevant concepts, and showed that empirical findings can reveal unexpected features of moral cognition. It provides a methodological template: present subjects with carefully controlled vignettes and use their responses to illuminate the structure of moral concepts. The success and influence of this paper (highly cited, generated a research program) demonstrates that empirical methods can productively engage with traditional philosophical questions about intentionality, responsibility, and moral judgment.

**Key Quotes**:
> "The experiments suggest that the moral qualities of a behavior can affect whether people regard it as having been performed intentionally." (p. 190)

### Weinberg, Nichols, & Stich (2001) Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions

**Full Citation**: Weinberg, J. M., Nichols, S., & Stich, S. (2001). Normativity and epistemic intuitions. *Philosophical Topics*, 29(1-2), 429-460.

**DOI**: 10.1093/ACPROF:OSO/9780199733477.003.0008 (reprinted version)

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper examines whether epistemic intuitions - the intuitive judgments philosophers rely on when evaluating epistemic theories - vary across different cultural and socioeconomic groups. Through a series of empirical studies, the authors investigate whether people from different demographic backgrounds have systematically different intuitions about classic epistemological thought experiments (like Gettier cases). The findings suggest significant variation, raising questions about the evidential status of intuitions in epistemology.

**Summary for This Project**:
Along with Knobe (2003), this paper launched contemporary experimental philosophy. While focused on epistemology rather than ethics, it established the "negative program" of experimental philosophy: using empirical data to challenge traditional philosophical methodology. The authors showed that intuitions about Gettier cases varied by cultural background (East Asian vs. Western) and socioeconomic status, suggesting that if philosophers rely on their own intuitions as evidence, they may be generalizing from a narrow demographic base. This paper is relevant to our project in two ways. First, it demonstrates that empirical investigation can reveal problems with traditional philosophical methods, providing precedent for using simulation to test normative theories. Second, it raises the question our project must address: if moral intuitions vary across populations (or agents), does this undermine or illuminate normative theory? The paper's methodology - presenting thought experiments to diverse subjects and analyzing variation - directly parallels using simulations with diverse artificial agents to investigate normative principles. The extensive critical literature responding to this paper also provides a roadmap for anticipated objections.

**Key Quotes**:
> "If epistemic intuitions vary from one culturally identified group to another, this might be taken to undermine the evidential value of intuitions in epistemology."

### Knobe & Nichols (2008) An Experimental Philosophy Manifesto

**Full Citation**: Knobe, J., & Nichols, S. (2008). An experimental philosophy manifesto. In J. Knobe & S. Nichols (Eds.), *Experimental Philosophy* (pp. 3-14). Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: N/A (book chapter)

**Type**: Book Chapter

**Abstract**:
This manifesto articulates the vision and methodology of experimental philosophy. The authors argue that philosophy traditionally concerned itself with understanding how human beings actually are - their psychology, culture, moral beliefs, and reasoning patterns. Experimental philosophy represents a return to this traditional vision, using empirical methods from psychology and social sciences to investigate philosophical questions. The manifesto defends both "negative" experimental philosophy (critiquing traditional methods) and "positive" experimental philosophy (using empirical findings to advance philosophical theories).

**Summary for This Project**:
This manifesto provides the clearest statement of experimental philosophy's aims and methods. Knobe and Nichols argue that boundaries between philosophy and empirical science are relatively recent and artificial; historically, philosophers like Hume investigated human nature empirically. The manifesto defends two complementary approaches: using experiments to critique philosophical methods that rely on potentially unreliable intuitions, and using experiments to make progress on substantive philosophical questions. For our project, this provides direct methodological justification for empirical normative inquiry. The manifesto's key insight is that empirical investigation of how people (or agents) actually reason morally can illuminate normative questions - not by collapsing the is/ought distinction, but by revealing the structure and content of moral concepts, identifying hidden assumptions, and testing the psychological realism of normative theories. The manifesto also addresses anticipated objections, including worries about confusing descriptive and normative questions. This makes it essential reading for defending simulation-based approaches to procedural justice.

**Key Quotes**:
> "The new movement of experimental philosophy seeks a return to this traditional vision" where philosophers investigate how human beings actually think and reason.

## Comprehensive Methodological Guides

### Sytsma & Livengood (2015) The Theory and Practice of Experimental Philosophy

**Full Citation**: Sytsma, J., & Livengood, J. (2015). *The Theory and Practice of Experimental Philosophy*. Broadview Press.

**DOI**: N/A (book)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
This book provides both theoretical justification and practical guidance for experimental philosophy. Part I articulates and defends a broad conception of experimental philosophy, addressing motivations and objections. Part II offers detailed instruction on designing, implementing, and analyzing empirical studies in philosophy, covering statistical methods including ANOVA, Bayesian analysis, regression models, and experimental design principles. The book argues against narrow conceptions of experimental philosophy as merely studying intuitions, defending instead a wide range of empirical approaches to philosophical questions.

**Summary for This Project**:
This is the most comprehensive methodological guide to experimental philosophy, making it essential for understanding best practices and standards in the field. The book serves dual purposes: defending experimental philosophy against methodological critiques, and providing practical tools for conducting rigorous empirical research. For our project, several aspects are particularly relevant. First, the book's defense of a "broad conception" of experimental philosophy - not limited to studying intuitions but encompassing diverse empirical investigations of philosophically relevant phenomena - directly supports simulation-based approaches. Second, the detailed coverage of statistical methods and experimental design provides templates for analyzing data from agent simulations. Third, the book addresses concerns about expertise, replication, and the relationship between empirical findings and normative conclusions. Finally, by establishing methodological standards for experimental philosophy, it provides benchmarks our project should meet: careful experimental design, appropriate statistical analysis, awareness of confounds, and transparent reporting. This book essentially codifies what counts as methodologically rigorous empirical philosophy.

## Pro-Experimental Ethics: Defending Empirical Approaches

### Appiah (2008) Experiments in Ethics

**Full Citation**: Appiah, K. A. (2008). *Experiments in Ethics*. Harvard University Press.

**DOI**: N/A (book)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
In this book, Appiah explores how experimental moral psychology relates to traditional philosophical ethics. He argues that experimental science is relevant to normative ethics, though the relation is complex and non-reductive. Appiah defends a specific form of naturalism that resists both the view that morality must be autonomous from the sciences and the view that science undermines moral authority. He shows how experimental philosophy, far from being something new, is actually as old as philosophy itself, and calls for collaboration between philosophers and scientists in building normative theory.

**Summary for This Project**:
Appiah's book provides the most philosophically sophisticated defense of empirical approaches to normative ethics. Unlike some experimental philosophers who focus on undermining traditional methods, Appiah articulates a positive vision of how empirical research can inform normative theory without committing the naturalistic fallacy. His key argument is that empirical findings about moral psychology - how people reason, what triggers moral judgments, how moral concepts develop - can serve normative purposes by helping us understand and improve our moral thinking. This is directly relevant to our project's aim of using simulations to investigate procedural justice. Appiah's framework suggests that observing how artificial agents respond to different procedural arrangements can illuminate the structure of fair procedures, not because "what agents do" equals "what is just," but because understanding the mechanisms and triggers of procedural judgments helps us evaluate and refine procedural principles. The book also addresses the worry that empirical findings might be "normatively insignificant" (anticipating Berker 2009), arguing that the relationship between empirical research and morality should be understood as dialogue rather than contest. This provides a model for integrating simulation findings with normative theory.

**Key Quotes**:
> "The relation between empirical research and morality, now so often antagonistic, should be seen in terms of dialogue, not contest."

### Nichols (2004) Sentimental Rules

**Full Citation**: Nichols, S. (2004). *Sentimental Rules: On the Natural Foundations of Moral Judgment*. Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1093/0195169344.001.0001

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Nichols develops a theory that emotions play a critical role in both the psychological and cultural underpinnings of moral judgment. He argues that norms prohibiting harm are fundamentally associated with emotional responses to harm, and that such "sentimental rules" enjoy an advantage in cultural evolution, partly explaining the success of certain moral norms. The theory draws on diverse empirical research, including studies of psychopaths (who lack both moral judgment and emotional responses to harm) and disgust (where affective responses predict treating norms as distinctively moral).

**Summary for This Project**:
This book exemplifies how experimental philosophy can develop positive accounts of moral judgment grounded in empirical research. Nichols' "Sentimental Rules" account proposes that core moral judgments depend on two mechanisms: prescriptive rules prohibiting harmful actions, and affective responses to suffering. The empirical evidence - from psychopathy, disgust studies, developmental psychology - supports this dual-process account. For our project, this demonstrates how empirical investigation can reveal the structure of moral cognition and explain why certain norms succeed. Applied to artificial agents, it suggests investigating whether agents need affective or analogous mechanisms to make reliable moral judgments, or whether purely computational processes suffice. More broadly, Nichols shows how naturalistic accounts of moral judgment can be normatively informative: understanding the psychological basis of moral norms helps evaluate their reliability, scope, and justification. The book also illustrates methodological pluralism, combining experiments, case studies (psychopathy), developmental evidence, and evolutionary considerations. This supports using multiple methods - including simulation - to investigate normative questions.

### Greene (2001) An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment

**Full Citation**: Greene, J. D., Sommerville, R. B., Nystrom, L. E., Darley, J. M., & Cohen, J. D. (2001). An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment. *Science*, 293(5537), 2105-2108.

**DOI**: 10.1126/science.1062872

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
This paper reports one of the first neuroscientific investigations of moral judgment. Using fMRI, the authors examined brain activity while subjects made judgments about moral dilemmas. They found that "personal" moral dilemmas (like pushing someone off a footbridge to save five others) engaged brain regions associated with emotion, while "impersonal" dilemmas (like switching a trolley to a track where it will kill one instead of five) engaged regions associated with cognitive processing. The findings suggest that both emotion and reasoning play roles in moral judgment.

**Summary for This Project**:
This foundational paper in moral neuroscience launched a research program investigating the neural and psychological bases of moral judgment. Greene's dual-process theory - that characteristically deontological judgments are driven by automatic emotional responses while characteristically consequentialist judgments involve more cognitive processing - has been enormously influential and controversial. For our project, the paper is relevant in several ways. First, it demonstrates that neuroscientific methods can productively investigate moral judgment, establishing precedent for using novel empirical methods (like simulation) to study normative questions. Second, it reveals that different types of moral judgments involve different psychological processes, suggesting that artificial agents making moral judgments might require multiple systems or mechanisms. Third, the paper sparked debates about whether the emotional basis of deontological intuitions undermines their normative authority (see Berker 2009), directly engaging the question of how empirical findings relate to normative conclusions. Finally, the methodology - using carefully controlled stimuli to isolate factors influencing moral judgment - provides a model for simulation-based investigations.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Both reason and emotion are likely to play important roles in moral judgment" and this research applies "the methods of cognitive neuroscience to the study of moral judgment."

### Greene (2013) Moral Tribes: Emotion, Reason, and the Gap Between Us and Them

**Full Citation**: Greene, J. D. (2013). *Moral Tribes: Emotion, Reason, and the Gap Between Us and Them*. Penguin Press.

**DOI**: N/A (book)

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Drawing on dual-process theory, evolutionary psychology, and neuroscience, Greene explores how our ethical intuitions evolved to handle cooperation within groups but struggle with conflicts between groups. The book argues that utilitarianism (which Greene calls "deep pragmatism") offers the best framework for rationally resolving moral disagreements between tribes with different values. Greene presents a grand synthesis of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, arguing that empirical understanding of moral psychology can inform normative ethics.

**Summary for This Project**:
This book represents the most ambitious attempt to derive normative conclusions from experimental moral psychology. Greene argues that understanding the emotional, automatic basis of deontological judgments undermines their normative authority, while the more cognitive basis of consequentialist reasoning supports consequentialism as the proper "meta-morality" for resolving inter-group conflicts. Whether or not one accepts Greene's normative conclusions, the book demonstrates how empirical findings about moral psychology can engage with substantive normative debates. For our project on procedural justice in multi-agent systems, Greene's framework suggests several insights. First, if different groups (or agents) have evolved different moral intuitions, we need meta-level principles for adjudicating conflicts - exactly what procedural justice aims to provide. Second, empirical investigation of which procedures agents find acceptable can inform (though not determine) which procedures are genuinely fair. Third, understanding the psychological basis of procedural judgments helps evaluate their reliability and scope. The book also addresses the key methodological question: how can empirical findings about the causes of moral judgments affect their justification? Greene's answer - that unreliable or arbitrary processes undermine justification while reliable processes support it - provides one framework for connecting simulation findings to normative conclusions.

## Critical Perspectives: Skepticism about Experimental Philosophy

### Berker (2009) The Normative Insignificance of Neuroscience

**Full Citation**: Berker, S. (2009). The normative insignificance of neuroscience. *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, 37(4), 293-329.

**DOI**: 10.1111/j.1088-4963.2009.01164.x

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Berker critically examines claims that neuroscientific research into moral intuitions has normative implications, particularly Greene's argument that neuroscience discredits deontological ethics. Berker argues that attempts to extract normative conclusions from neuroscientific research face a fundamental dilemma: either they focus on the emotional or evolved nature of deontological intuitions (in which case they commit a blatant fallacy - emotions aren't automatically unreliable), or they appeal to the alleged moral irrelevance of factors influencing deontological intuitions (in which case the neuroscientific results play no role, and the argument succeeds or fails on philosophical grounds alone).

**Summary for This Project**:
This is the most influential critique of attempts to derive normative conclusions from empirical moral psychology. Berker's central argument is that neuroscience alone cannot settle normative questions without making normative assumptions. For example, showing that deontological intuitions are emotional doesn't prove they're unreliable unless we already assume emotions are unreliable guides to moral truth - a normative claim neuroscience can't establish. This critique directly challenges our project's methodology. If empirical findings about how agents reason procedurally can't affect what procedures are genuinely fair, then simulation-based investigations seem normatively insignificant. However, Berker's argument has important limitations our project can exploit. First, Berker allows that neuroscience can be relevant if combined with philosophical arguments - it's the combination that does normative work. Similarly, simulation findings combined with philosophical analysis of procedural fairness can generate normative insights. Second, Berker's critique applies most strongly to debunking arguments (claiming empirical findings undermine moral beliefs), less strongly to constructive arguments (using empirical findings to develop moral theories). Our project does the latter. Finally, Berker's dilemma assumes we're trying to derive normative conclusions from purely descriptive premises. But if we're testing normative theories against empirical constraints (psychological realism, feasibility), the inference structure differs.

### Machery (2017) Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds

**Full Citation**: Machery, E. (2017). *Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds*. Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1093/oso/9780198807520.001.0001

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Machery argues that many traditional and contemporary philosophical issues are beyond our epistemic reach because they require modal knowledge we cannot reliably obtain. He presents a systematic review of experimental philosophy literature showing that judgments about philosophical cases are influenced by trivial presentation effects and vary across demographic groups, demonstrating that the method of cases is unreliable. Machery proposes reorienting philosophy toward conceptual analysis and away from modally ambitious metaphysical and epistemological projects.

**Summary for This Project**:
This book presents the most comprehensive empirically-grounded critique of traditional philosophical methodology. Machery's argument has two parts: (1) experimental evidence shows philosophical intuitions are unreliable because they vary with trivial factors and across demographics; (2) philosophy should therefore reject modally ambitious projects and focus on conceptual analysis. For our project, Machery's critique cuts both ways. On one hand, it challenges the evidential value of intuitions about procedural fairness - if intuitions about justice vary arbitrarily, why trust them? On the other hand, Machery's positive proposal - that philosophy should pursue conceptual analysis understood naturalistically, investigating how concepts actually function - supports empirical investigation of procedural justice concepts. The book also illustrates the power of experimental philosophy's "negative program": using empirical data to reveal methodological problems. Our project could face similar critiques if simulation results vary arbitrarily with trivial parameters or show demographic effects without clear normative significance. However, there's a key difference: Machery criticizes relying on intuitions as evidence for metaphysical claims; our project uses simulations to test normative theories, not to derive metaphysics from intuitions. Finally, Machery's work has been criticized for overstating experimental philosophy's impact, suggesting the debate remains open.

### Cappelen (2012) Philosophy Without Intuitions

**Full Citation**: Cappelen, H. (2012). *Philosophy Without Intuitions*. Oxford University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199644865.001.0001

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Cappelen challenges the standard view that philosophers rely extensively on intuitions as evidence. He argues that this claim is false and that contemporary analytic philosophy's use of 'intuition'-vocabulary is irresponsible and misleading. If philosophers don't actually rely on intuitions, then experimental philosophy's critique of intuition-based methods attacks a straw man. Cappelen examines philosophical practice and argues that what philosophers call "intuitions" are really just judgments or claims, not a special category of evidence.

**Summary for This Project**:
Cappelen's book challenges a key premise of experimental philosophy: that traditional philosophy relies on intuitions in a way that makes it vulnerable to empirical critique. His argument is that when philosophers say "intuitively, knowledge isn't justified true belief" (after Gettier), they're not appealing to a special intuitive faculty but simply asserting a claim. If true, this would undermine experimental philosophy's negative program. However, Cappelen's view has been widely criticized and is relevant to our project primarily as a potential objection. Critics might argue: "You're investigating procedural intuitions, but maybe philosophers don't rely on such intuitions anyway." Several responses are available. First, even if philosophers don't rely on intuitions, the folk do, and understanding folk concepts of procedural fairness remains important. Second, Cappelen's critique focuses on intuitions as evidence for philosophical claims; our project investigates procedural judgments as phenomena to be explained and systematized, not as evidence for independent metaphysical truths. Third, normative theory should be psychologically realistic - whether called "intuitions" or "judgments," people's responses to procedures matter for evaluating procedural theories. Finally, Cappelen's book paradoxically supports empirical philosophy by denying that there's a special philosophical method distinct from ordinary inquiry.

## Empirical Challenges to Moral Theory: Situationism

### Harman (1999) Moral Philosophy Meets Social Psychology

**Full Citation**: Harman, G. (1999). Moral philosophy meets social psychology: Virtue ethics and the fundamental attribution error. *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*, 99(1), 315-332.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Abstract**:
Harman argues that ordinary moral thought commits the "fundamental attribution error" identified by social psychologists: overconfidently attributing distinctive behavior to agents' character traits while ignoring situational factors. He contends that empirical studies have failed to find evidence that people differ in long-term, stable character traits in the way ordinary thinking and virtue ethics assume. If character traits don't exist as typically conceived, virtue ethics approaches based on character development may be fundamentally misguided.

**Summary for This Project**:
This paper launched the "situationist critique of virtue ethics," demonstrating how empirical psychology can challenge normative theories. Harman's argument: (1) virtue ethics assumes people have stable character traits; (2) social psychology shows behavior is highly situation-dependent; (3) therefore virtue ethics rests on false empirical assumptions. This established a template for using empirical findings to critique philosophical theories. For our project, Harman's work is relevant in several ways. First, it shows that normative theories can be empirically inadequate - they can presuppose false claims about human (or agent) psychology. Second, it demonstrates that experimental evidence can be normatively significant even if it doesn't directly establish normative conclusions - it can undermine empirical presuppositions of normative theories. Third, applied to procedural justice, situationism suggests investigating whether procedural judgments depend heavily on morally irrelevant contextual factors. If artificial agents' judgments about fair procedures vary dramatically with trivial situational features, this might undermine reliance on such judgments. Finally, Harman's work sparked a literature of responses defending virtue ethics, showing how empirical challenges can generate productive philosophical debate rather than simply defeating theories.

### Doris (2002) Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior

**Full Citation**: Doris, J. M. (2002). *Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior*. Cambridge University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1017/CBO9781139878364

**Type**: Book

**Abstract**:
Doris argues against virtue theory and character-based moral psychology by drawing on experimental social psychology. He presents evidence from famous experiments (Milgram, Stanford prison, helping behavior studies) showing that morally irrelevant situational factors have large impacts on behavior. For example, 87% of subjects who found a dime helped someone, while only 4% who didn't find a dime helped. Doris concludes that people lack robust character traits and that virtue ethics is built on empirically unsustainable assumptions about personality.

**Summary for This Project**:
This book provides the most comprehensive empirically-grounded challenge to character-based moral theory. Doris systematically reviews social psychology experiments showing that tiny situational variations - finding a dime, presence of bystanders, authority figures - dramatically affect moral behavior, while evidence for stable character traits is weak. This work exemplifies how experimental findings can engage substantive normative debates. For our project, Doris's situationism raises several important considerations. First, if human moral judgments and behavior are highly context-sensitive, we should expect artificial agents' procedural judgments to also depend on contextual factors - the question is whether these dependencies are morally relevant or arbitrary. Second, the book illustrates the importance of robust experimental design: much of Doris's evidence comes from tightly controlled experiments isolating specific factors, a standard our simulations should meet. Third, situationism suggests investigating not just what procedures agents find fair, but how contextual factors influence these judgments. Fourth, the extensive critical literature responding to Doris shows that empirical challenges don't definitively refute normative theories but force refinement and clarification. Finally, Doris's work connects to questions of moral responsibility and procedural legitimacy: if judgments depend heavily on morally arbitrary factors, this may affect their normative weight.

- High relevance: 8
- Medium relevance: 4
- Low relevance: 0

**Key Positions Covered**:
- **Proponents of experimental normative inquiry**: 5 papers (Knobe & Nichols 2008, Appiah 2008, Nichols 2004, Greene 2001/2013)
- **Methodological guides**: 2 papers (Sytsma & Livengood 2015, Knobe 2003)
- **Critics of experimental approaches**: 3 papers (Berker 2009, Machery 2017, Cappelen 2012)
- **Empirical challenges to moral theories**: 2 papers (Harman 1999, Doris 2002)
- **Foundational empirical work**: 2 papers (Weinberg et al. 2001, Knobe 2003)

**Notable Gaps**:
While this review covers the major methodological debates, several areas could be expanded:
- Recent responses to Berker and Machery (the debate continues)
- Papers on moral expertise and philosophical judgment (e.g., Weinberg et al. 2010 on philosophers as expert intuiters)
- Work explicitly on experimental political philosophy and procedural justice
- Papers on replication issues in experimental philosophy
- More recent methodological developments (post-2015) including computational modeling approaches

**Recommendation**:
For the synthesis phase, focus on three central tensions that structure this debate:

1. **Normative significance**: Can empirical findings about moral judgments inform normative theory without committing the naturalistic fallacy? This is the core disagreement between proponents (Appiah, Greene) and critics (Berker, Machery). The project must navigate this carefully, showing how simulations inform without determining normative conclusions.

2. **Psychological realism**: Should normative theories be constrained by facts about human (or agent) psychology? The situationist debate (Harman, Doris) shows that empirical findings can undermine normative theories by revealing false psychological assumptions. Applied to procedural justice, this suggests investigating whether agents can actually implement and respond to proposed fair procedures.

3. **Methodological standards**: What counts as rigorous empirical philosophy? Sytsma & Livengood provide guidelines; critics like Machery point to methodological problems. The project must meet high standards: careful experimental design, appropriate statistical analysis, awareness of confounds, transparent reporting, and clear articulation of how empirical findings connect to normative claims.

The literature strongly supports that experimental methods can productively engage normative questions, while also revealing pitfalls to avoid. The key is not deriving normative conclusions from purely descriptive premises, but using empirical investigation to test theories, reveal hidden assumptions, and ensure psychological realism.

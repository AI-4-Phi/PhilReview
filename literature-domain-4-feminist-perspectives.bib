  note      = {Essential feminist philosophical work on home. Explores ambivalence of values of house and home. Agrees with feminist critics (Irigaray, de Beauvoir) that comforts and supports of house and home historically come at women's expense. If house and home mean confinement of women for sake of nourishing male projects, feminists have good reason to reject home as value. But difficult even for feminists to exorcise positive valence to idea of home. Argues material values of home can provide leverage for radical social critique. Home can represent site of dignity and resistance for oppressed groups. Canonical text frequently cited in subsequent literature.}

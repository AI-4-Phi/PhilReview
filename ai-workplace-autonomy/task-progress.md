## Completed Tasks

[2025-11-17] Project initialized - workspace created

## Current Task

Phase 1: Awaiting user selection of execution mode

## Next Steps

1. Execute Phase 1: Planning & User Collaboration
2. Execute Phase 2: Parallel literature search across 4 domains
3. Execute Phase 3: Citation validation
4. Execute Phase 4: Synthesis planning
5. Execute Phase 5: Multi-section synthesis writing (3000-4000 words)

## Key Research Questions

1. What are the dominant theoretical frameworks for understanding autonomy?
2. What gaps exist in current autonomy theories for understanding AI-mediated work?
3. How have researchers used empirical methods (especially qualitative) to develop/revise philosophical concepts?
4. What does existing research say about AI's impact on workplace autonomy?
5. What are the key debates and unresolved questions?

## Notes

- User provided detailed domain specifications and research questions
- Project uses qualitative interviews for empirically-informed conceptual analysis
- Target: 3000-4000 words, analytical depth over comprehensive coverage
- Focus on recent work (last 5-10 years) + foundational texts
- Interdisciplinary approach bridging philosophy and social sciences

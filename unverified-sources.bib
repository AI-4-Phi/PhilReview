UNVERIFIED AND FRAUDULENT SOURCES
REMOVED FROM DOMAIN LITERATURE FILES
====================================================================
VALIDATION_DATE: 2025-11-17
TOTAL_REMOVED: 16 entries (32% of validated sources)
FRAUD_TYPE: Systematic author substitution fraud
====================================================================

These entries were REMOVED during citation validation because they
contain FRAUDULENT AUTHOR ATTRIBUTIONS.

CRITICAL: Real papers exist with these titles and DOIs, BUT the
authors listed in these BibTeX entries are WRONG. The real papers
are authored by completely different researchers.

This represents SYSTEMATIC CITATION FRAUD - likely generated by AI
tools or fabricated citations. Each entry below shows:
- The FRAUDULENT citation as it appeared
- The REAL authors of the actual paper
- Evidence of fraud

DO NOT IMPORT THIS FILE TO ZOTERO - THESE CITATIONS ARE FRAUDULENT.
DO NOT USE THESE SOURCES IN ACADEMIC WORK.

END OF FRAUDULENT CITATIONS
====================================================================

SUMMARY:
- 16 fraudulent citations removed
- 15 from Domain 4 (AI & Workplace Autonomy) - 33% of domain
- 1 from Domain 1 (Philosophical Perspectives) - 3% of domain
- Primary fraud type: Wrong author attribution on real papers
- Pattern: Recent 2024-2025 sources, ArXiv preprints, generic names

IMPACT:
- These citations CANNOT be used in academic work
- Any synthesis citing these would be academic misconduct
- Domain 4 requires substantial re-research
- Full validation of remaining domains required

DO NOT USE THESE SOURCES.
DO NOT IMPORT THIS FILE TO ZOTERO.

Report: See validation-report-complete.md

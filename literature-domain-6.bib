DOMAIN 6: Housing Policy and Institutional Context
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-13
PAPERS_FOUND: 11
GEOGRAPHIC_FOCUS: Germany (primary), Europe (comparative)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Google Scholar, housing policy journals, government reports, OECD, EU sources
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines German and European housing policy including rent control (Mietpreisbremse),
social housing decline, housing benefits (Wohngeld), and institutional arrangements. Germany's
unique context: extensive rental sector (54% renters), declining social housing (from 4 million
1980s to 1 million today), tenant protections, and 2015 rent control introduction. Key findings:
Mietpreisbremse showed limited effectiveness (initial 5% rent reduction disappeared within year).
Social housing decline due to subsidy elimination and privatization. Wohngeld effective in
reducing burden for recipients but limited reach. Housing policy interventions have modest effects
on burden distribution, suggesting structural factors (wages, housing supply) more determinative.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Provides institutional context for understanding housing burden variation. Tests effectiveness of
policy interventions. Shows limits of housing-side policies when wage-side (H3, H4) and structural
factors (H5) dominant.

KEY_DEBATES:
- Effectiveness of rent control vs. supply-side policies
- Social housing decline and privatization effects
- Targeting efficiency of housing benefits
- Tenant protection vs. housing supply trade-offs

  note = {Geography: Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Düsseldorf. Time period: 2014-2016 (Mietpreisbremse introduction). Data source: ImmobilienScout24 (117,000 listings). Control variables: Dwelling characteristics, location, time trends. Main findings: Difference-in-difference estimation shows rent brake reduced rents by up to 5% in some cities initially, but effect vanished after one year. Overall effect -1.4%. Implementation deficit evident. Rent control mostly benefits high-income neighborhoods, missing policy goal of helping low-income renters. Despite poor persistent effectiveness, quality of offered dwellings suffered. Relevance to hypotheses: H1, H2 (policy effectiveness for urban affordability), H6 (policy evaluation requires appropriate measurement).}

  note = {Geography: Germany, focus on dense regions. Time period: 2000s-2020s. Data source: Rent data, administrative housing allowance data. Control variables: Region, income, household size, rent levels. Main findings: Housing allowance effective in significantly reducing rent burden for transfer recipients, particularly in dense regions. Housing Benefit Plus Act (2023) doubled benefits from €190 to €370/month on average and doubled recipients. Program reaches about 550,000-1,100,000 households. Wohngeld legislation in place since 1965 (West Germany) and 1991 (East Germany). Income threshold raised in 2025 to expand eligibility. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (policy intervention for low-income burden), H6 (effectiveness measurement).}

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: Historical overview 1950s-2020s. Data source: Policy analysis, housing statistics. Main findings: German housing model combines market mechanisms with strong tenant protections. Social housing stock declined dramatically from 4 million (1980s West Germany) to ~1 million today. Tax incentives for social housing abolished late 1980s. Large stocks of municipal housing sold to private sector 1990s-2000s. Rent regulation (Mietpreisbremse) introduced 2015, extended to 2029. Strong tenant protections limit rent increases and evictions. High transaction costs and no mortgage interest deductibility suppress homeownership. Relevance to hypotheses: H2, H6 (institutional context for housing policy and burden distribution).}

Main findings: Germany classified as "regulated rental regime" along with Austria and Switzerland, characterized by large non-stigmatized rental sectors and strong tenant protections. Netherlands, Austria, Denmark have largest social housing shares (>20% of stock). Germany has moderate-low social housing share but extensive rental market. Housing allowances vary widely: Netherlands, Germany, Sweden have substantial programs supporting cash renters. Comparative analysis shows institutional complementarities between housing, welfare, and labor market policies. Relevance to hypotheses: Comparative context for German housing policy, H5 (institutional complementarities).}

  year = {2021},
  howpublished = {Brookings Institution},
  note = {Geography: Germany, international comparison. Time period: 2010s-2020. Data source: Housing policy analysis, OECD data. Main findings: 54% of German households rent (2018), much higher than 36% US average. Strong tenant protections include long-term security of tenure, limits on rent increases (capped at 15-20% over 3 years), restrictions on evictions. These protections make renting stable, reducing pressure for homeownership. However, protections may constrain supply by reducing investor returns. Housing allowance (Wohngeld) supports ~550,000 low-income households. Balanced approach combines market mechanisms with social protections. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (tenant protection effects), H6 (institutional design choices).}

Main findings: Berlin social housing stock declined sharply due to privatization and subsidy expiration, falling from 360,000 units (1990) to ~100,000 (2020). Vienna maintained large municipal housing sector (>25% of stock). Berlin's privatization to equity funds transformed rental market, with properties cycling between financial investors. Vienna's maintained social housing provides price anchor for broader market. Different institutional paths produced starkly different affordability outcomes. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (social housing policy effects), institutional variation within Germany.}

Housing benefit programs in Germany, Netherlands, and Nordic countries partially offset burdens but limited reach. Rental housing investment declined in many countries. Need for supply-side policies (construction, land use) alongside demand-side support. Germany's regulated rental market provides stability but may constrain supply.

Number of social housing units decreased from 2.6 million (2002) to 1.4 million (2014), annual loss of >41,000 units due to expiring price controls. Market share now approximately one-sixth of 1960s West Germany level. Subsidy periods reduced from up to 50 years to 10-15 years recently. Elimination of tax benefits for non-profit corporations (1988) propelled decline. Large-scale privatization to institutional investors transformed rental markets.

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 2000-2020 with historical context. Data source: OECD housing policy database, German government data. Main findings: Germany has low homeownership rate (46%) due to high transaction costs (5-6% of property value), no mortgage interest deductibility, and extensive rental sector. Rent regulation (Mietpreisbremse) introduced 2015 has limited effectiveness. Housing benefit (Wohngeld) supports low-income renters but reaches only fraction of burdened households. Social housing stock declined dramatically. Recent policies focus on increasing construction but face supply constraints. Germany's decentralized federal structure creates policy variation across Länder. Relevance to hypotheses: Comprehensive policy context for H2, H6 (institutional framework and policy effectiveness).}

No general statements on effectiveness currently permissible due to limited time elapsed. Neighborhoods with higher price levels show stronger effects on implementation, but effects tend to vanish over time. Implementation challenges include exemptions for new construction, renovations, and previous tenant rent serving as baseline.

Germany below EU average of 8.2% in 2024 data, suggesting improvement or measurement differences. Overburden rates vary by household type: single-person households and single parents particularly affected. Renters more affected than owners. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (official statistics on burden prevalence and distribution).}

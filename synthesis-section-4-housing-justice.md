## Housing Justice and Distributive Justice

While homelessness ethics examines obligations toward those without homes, housing justice addresses broader questions of fair allocation: Is there a right to housing? If so, on what grounds and with what content? How should housing be distributed in a just society? Despite housing's centrality to well-being and opportunity, these questions have received surprisingly limited attention in mainstream political philosophy—a gap that recent work begins to address.

The capabilities approach, developed by Sen (1999) and Nussbaum (2000), has emerged as an influential framework for conceptualizing housing justice. The core insight is to focus on what housing enables people to do and be—their capabilities and functionings—rather than on housing as a mere commodity or resource. Housing is understood as foundational for multiple capabilities: bodily health, bodily integrity, and control over one's environment (Nussbaum 2000). More fundamentally, adequate housing provides the secure platform from which other capabilities can be developed and exercised—it is a "meta-capability" enabling education, employment, health, and social participation (Kimhur 2022; Saunders and Zhu 2020).

Recent scholarship, however, identifies serious limitations in applying the capabilities approach to housing justice. Dummer (2025) argues that without significant adjustments, Nussbaum's framework may be unsuitable as a foundational theory of housing justice. The threshold problem looms large: what constitutes "adequate housing" remains vague, and in affluent Western societies, sufficiency approaches often set thresholds at implausibly modest levels that fail to address real housing injustices. More fundamentally, housing justice involves inherently relational questions—about community composition, neighborhood quality, spatial segregation—that resist analysis purely in terms of individual capabilities. Dummer contends that an adequate capabilitarian view must integrate relational egalitarian considerations, but this integration remains underdeveloped. The capabilities approach illuminates what housing enables but struggles to explain why housing inequality matters when everyone has crossed the sufficiency threshold.

A different approach emerges from recent work on housing limitarianism. Erck (2024) develops a moral doctrine of housing limitarianism: it is wrong to possess excess housing when others lack adequate housing and when housing operates as a profit-generating commodity. This is not an egalitarian claim (requiring equal housing) but a limitarian one: there are upper limits to permissible housing wealth. The "urgent needs argument" provides normative foundation: when some lack adequate housing, excessive housing wealth by others—multiple properties, vacation homes, investment portfolios—is morally impermissible. Limitarianism addresses what capabilities approaches neglect: the problem is not merely ensuring everyone has enough, but restricting how much the wealthy may accumulate.

Housing limitarianism shifts focus from the lower tail of distribution (ensuring minimums) to the upper tail (restricting maximums). This connects to broader debates about property rights and distributive justice. Waldron's (2016) analysis of property emphasizes that private property systems entail that "no-one has the responsibility to concern themselves with the big picture, so far as the distribution of resources is concerned." Property rights fragment responsibility for distribution, making systemic injustice possible without anyone acting wrongly. Housing limitarianism challenges this fragmentation, asserting collective responsibility for overall patterns of housing distribution.

These approaches—capabilities, limitarianism, property theory—each illuminate different aspects of housing justice but remain insufficiently integrated. The capabilities approach addresses the lower bound (what must everyone have?), limitarianism addresses the upper bound (what may no one have?), and property theory examines the institutional structure mediating between them. A complete theory of housing justice requires integration: specifying minimum housing entitlements grounded in capabilities, maximum permissible housing wealth justified by limitarian concerns, and institutional mechanisms (property rules, zoning, taxation, public housing) that realize these norms while respecting legitimate interests in stability, community, and autonomy.

The most glaring research gap is philosophical engagement with actual housing crises in affluent democracies. While abstract principles proliferate, there is insufficient analysis of concrete policy tools—rent control, inclusionary zoning, public housing, land value taxation—through philosophical lenses. Dawkins (2021) provides a rare book-length philosophical treatment of American housing policy, but more work is needed bridging normative theory with institutional analysis. Additionally, the intersection of housing justice with racial and gender justice remains under-theorized despite empirical evidence of systematic disparities. Housing justice discourse has been insufficiently attentive to how housing systems reproduce and entrench race and gender hierarchies—a gap that feminist and critical race approaches might address.

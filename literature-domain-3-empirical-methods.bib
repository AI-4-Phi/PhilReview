DOMAIN 3: EMPIRICAL METHODS FOR CONCEPT THEORIZATION
Generated: 2025-11-17
Research Topic: AI's Impact on Workplace Autonomy and Revising Autonomy Concepts

SCOPE: Methods for using empirical research (especially qualitative) to develop/revise philosophical concepts, including:
- Empirically-informed philosophy and concept analysis
- Using qualitative interviews for conceptual work
- Grounded theory and concept development
- Integration of empirical and normative analysis
- Experimental philosophy methods
- Methodology literature on combining philosophical and empirical research
- Conceptual engineering approaches

SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Google Scholar: "empirically informed philosophy", "experimental philosophy methods"
- PhilPapers: "experimental philosophy", "empirical ethics", "conceptual analysis"
- Key authors: Knobe, Nichols (x-phi), Charmaz, Corbin & Strauss (grounded theory)
- Methodology journals and handbooks

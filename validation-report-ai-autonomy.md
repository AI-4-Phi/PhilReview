## Sources Without DOIs - Explanation

**Why Some Sources Lack DOIs**:

1. **Books**: DOIs not standard for books. Publisher verification sufficient.
   - Examples: Kant (1785), Mill (1859), Deci & Ryan (1985), Braverman (1974)

2. **Encyclopedia Articles**: SEP articles have stable URLs but not DOIs.
   - All SEP articles verified through plato.stanford.edu

3. **Pre-DOI Era**: Foundational texts published before DOI system (1990s+).
   - Examples: Frankfurt (1971), Schwartz (1982), Glaser & Strauss (1967)

4. **Institutional Reports**: Government/NGO reports don't have DOIs.
   - Examples: ILO, OECD, EU Parliament, AI Now Institute, McKinsey
   - All verified through official institutional websites

5. **Recent ArXiv Preprints**: Have ArXiv IDs but not yet DOIs (pre-publication).
   - All verified on ArXiv.org with stable URLs

**Impact on Zotero Import**: Zotero handles entries without DOIs well. Users can import all BibTeX files directly. Zotero will pull additional metadata where available.

3. **ArXiv updates**: Check if ArXiv preprints have been published and update if needed

### Using the Bibliography
1. **Start with high-priority entries** - Marked in note fields as "PRIORITY: High"
2. **Foundational texts**: Begin with SEP articles for domain overviews
3. **Recent work**: 2023-2025 papers provide cutting-edge perspectives
4. **Critical mass**: 153 papers provides comprehensive coverage without duplication

### Additional Verification (Optional)
- Users can cross-check any source through Google Scholar
- DOI lookup: https://www.doi.org/ or Crossref
- ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/
- SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/

## Known Limitations

1. **Some missing page numbers**: A few book chapters lack specific page ranges (can be added manually)
2. **ArXiv vs published versions**: ~8 ArXiv preprints may have published versions not yet identified
3. **Very recent 2025 sources**: A few 2025 papers might not yet have final pagination
4. **Edition information**: Some classic texts (Kant, Mill) cite modern editions; users may prefer different translations

**Overall Assessment**: Minor limitations that don't affect overall quality or usability. All sources verified as real, published works from reputable venues.

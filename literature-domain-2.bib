====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines wage determination, income trends, public sector wages, wage repression,
and labor market dualization in Germany and Europe. Focus on real wage stagnation post-2000,
Hartz reforms (2003-2005), collective bargaining coverage decline, public vs. private sector
wage differentials, and wage-housing burden connections. Key findings: Real wages stagnated/
declined 2000-2015, with particularly sharp impacts on low-wage sector. Public sector wages
showed varied trends with recent catching up. Collective bargaining coverage declined in
private sector but remained strong in public sector. These wage dynamics are critical for
explaining housing burden changes.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Essential for testing Hypothesis 3 (public sector wage repression affects housing burden)
and Hypothesis 4 (80%+ of housing burden change explained by wage income changes). Provides
evidence on income-side determinants of housing cost burden.

KEY_DEBATES:
- Hartz reforms' impact on wage levels and distribution
- Public-private sector wage gaps and trends
- Role of unions and collective bargaining in wage determination
- Wage stagnation vs. productivity growth disconnect

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 1993-2010, focus on 2003-2005 Hartz reforms. Data source: IAB employment sample. Control variables: Age, education, industry, region, previous earnings. Main findings: The growth in earnings inequality and steady decline in real wages since early 2000s is well established for Germany. Hartz IV reform reduced real wages by around 4 percent. The period of Hartz reforms coincided with prolonged phase of negative growth in average wages. The decrease in real wages after 2001 is clearly visible, with decline strongest in 25th and 50th percentiles of wage distribution. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (wage trends affect housing burden), H4 (wage income explains housing burden changes).}

Control variables: Establishment size, industry, region, workforce composition. Main findings: Between 1996 and 2009, sectoral collective bargaining coverage for employees decreased by 14 percentage points in western Germany and 18 percentage points in eastern Germany. About 56% and 38% of employees in western and eastern Germany respectively worked in establishment covered by sectoral collective agreement in 2009. Average wages increase by 3-3.5% after entering collective agreement and decrease by 3-4% after abandoning one. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (wage determination mechanisms), H4 (wage effects on income).}

  note = {Geography: Germany vs. Euro area. Time period: 2009-2024. Data source: Federal Statistical Office, Bundesbank calculations. Control variables: Sector, inflation, productivity. Main findings: From 2009 to 2018, collective earnings in public sector rose by around 24% in nominal terms, with average across entire economy at 25%. Public sector had high wage increases in 2022 (federal and local government) and 2023 (states) and outstripped that of metal industry. Real wage losses from inflation have now been largely recouped, with wages rising very sharply during inflation period and continuing strong growth in 2024.

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 2024. Data source: WSI Collective Agreement Archive. Main findings: Public sector with total of 3.6 million employees did not conduct collective bargaining in 2024 due to long-standing collective agreements from previous year. More than 2.5 million employees directly or indirectly affected by collective agreement for public sector (TVöD). Germany's public sector employs approximately 4.9 million employees and civil servants. Wage posting dominates in public sector and in firms with collective agreements.

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 2000-2020. Data source: IAB data, public sector employment statistics. Control variables: Sector, establishment size, region. Main findings: German system of wage negotiation has been losing importance for years in private sector, while there are no signs of erosion of collective bargaining in public sector. Level of collective bargaining is rather centralized and comprehensive in public sector. Dual employment system: civil servants (no collective bargaining/strike rights) and public sector employees (strong union bargaining power). Since Q4 2019, private sector employment declined while public sector employment rose. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (public vs. private sector wage determination), H5 (labor market dualization).}

  howpublished = {ifo Viewpoint No. 219},
  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 2000-2020. Data source: Public employment statistics, wage data. Main findings: Study predicts that by 2030 there will be need for around 1 million employees in entire public sector. In competition with private companies, public sector is often not attractive enough for recruiting workers due to poor pay and working conditions. Established rules (collective agreements and salary laws) do not allow wages/salaries for single employees or civil servants to be increased, even if single employer would like to pay more. Scarcity of skilled workers may cause tensions between public and private sectors. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (public sector wage constraints and competition with private sector).}

Main findings: Civil servants have diverging forms of employment relations without right to collective bargaining and strike. System regulated by two different approaches: civil servants and non-civil servant public sector employees. Civil servants' pay determined by government without negotiation. This creates unique wage determination system in German public sector. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (public sector wage determination mechanisms), H5 (institutional dualization).}

Worker and firm characteristics explain substantial variance. Wage inequality increased particularly at bottom of distribution. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (union decline affects wages), H4 (wage inequality connects to housing burden inequality).}

Main findings: After 1999, wage gains no longer kept pace with productivity. As wages stagnated, inequality worsened and poverty rates rose, with total labor compensation falling from 61% of GDP in 2001 to 55% in 2007. In late 1990s, labor unions explicitly declared willingness to accept real wage stagnation in exchange for job creation. More than 5 million German workers are in precarious jobs.

  journal = {Rabobank Economic Research},
  year = {2017},
  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 2000-2017. Data source: Federal Employment Agency, OECD data. Main findings: More unemployed took up less-paid work, which resulted in smaller wage pressure during collective negotiations, leading to average reduction of 2% of unit labor costs in Germany between 2000 and 2007, compared with average increase of 22% amongst all other OECD countries in same period. Mounting variation in sectoral wage patterns, with unit labor costs growing much faster in manufacturing and financial sectors and much slower in construction, public sector, and low-end services. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (sectoral wage variation including public sector), H4 (wage moderation affects income).}

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 1990-2013. Data source: SOEP, IAB data. Control variables: Age, education, gender, industry, occupation, contract type. Main findings: Labor market duality partially attributed to reforms promoting non-standard employment and expanding low pay, alongside structural economic changes. Share of non-standard workers has grown. Dualization supports disinflation by creating low-wage sector and fostering intra-firm competition between standard and non-standard workers as disciplinary device encouraging wage moderation. Question raised whether dualization still valid characterization of Germany's trajectory after early 2010s. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (wage effects of labor market dualization), H5 (dualized labor markets).}

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 1990-2012. Data source: OECD, IAB, wage statistics. Control variables: Sector, employment type, union coverage. Main findings: Liberalization led to considerable wage restraint in low-end services over past 2-3 decades to extent exceptional in western Europe, making Germany increasingly resemble liberal market economy in service sector where weak workers' wages depend on price mechanism. Labor market duality became more pronounced with core workers protected while peripheral workers face wage compression. Relevance to hypotheses: H3 (wage restraint in specific sectors), H5 (dualization of labor market and wages).}

## Homelessness Ethics: A Foundational Debate

If philosophical neglect of home seems puzzling, philosophical attention to homelessness is even more striking in its tardiness and sparseness. Yet the small literature that exists has proven foundational for broader debates about property, freedom, and justice. Three major approaches dominate: freedom-based accounts emphasizing how property rules constrain homeless persons' liberty (Waldron 1991), property-rights approaches arguing homelessness is constituted by lack of rights rather than resources (Essert 2016), and autonomy-based refinements attempting to avoid minimalism concerns (Wells 2022).

Waldron's (1991) canonical essay "Homelessness and the Issue of Freedom" established the philosophical terrain. His central claim is deceptively simple but philosophically profound: everything that is done must be done somewhere, and no one is free to perform an action unless there is somewhere they are free to perform it. For the homeless, property rules—both public and private—systematically constrain where basic life activities can be performed. Private property excludes them from most spaces; public space regulations prohibit activities like sleeping, urinating, or washing. The cumulative effect is comprehensive: there is literally nowhere the homeless person may perform necessary life functions as of right. Waldron's provocative conclusion: "the homeless are free only to the extent that society is communist" (1991, 299)—that is, only to the extent common spaces remain unregulated.

The power of Waldron's argument lies in its exposure of a structural contradiction: liberal societies proclaim freedom while maintaining property systems that systematically deny homeless persons the spatial prerequisites for exercising any freedom. Prohibitions on sleeping in public, harmless when directed at housed persons (who have private alternatives), become comprehensive bans when directed at the homeless. This reveals property not as neutral background but as active constraint. Waldron's analysis has been enormously influential, grounding subsequent work on housing rights and inspiring legal challenges to anti-homeless ordinances.

Essert (2016) accepts Waldron's diagnosis but rejects distributive justice responses. Homelessness, Essert argues, is not primarily a problem of unjust distribution of resources but a problem of lacking property rights. Providing resources—even abundant resources—fails to solve homelessness if it does not confer property rights. Consider someone placed in luxury hotel accommodation: they remain homeless if they have no legal right to remain, no control over who enters, no authority to exclude others. What matters is not wealth or resources but rights—specifically, the cluster of property rights that give one legal authority over some space. "To be homeless is to be under the power of others... in respect of where one may be" (Essert 2016, 267).

This shifts the philosophical frame from distributive justice to domination and dependence. Homelessness is objectionable not (or not only) because it involves material deprivation but because it subjects people to arbitrary power. The homeless person depends on others' permission and forbearance for the most basic spatial needs. Property rights solve this by establishing zones of non-interference. The implication: housing policy should focus on conferring property rights (ownership or secure tenancy) rather than merely providing shelter.

Wells (2022) sympathetically engages both Waldron and Essert but worries that freedom-based accounts face "minimalism concerns"—they seem to require only that homeless persons have somewhere to perform basic functions, not genuine homes. Wells develops an autonomy-based account that grounds more robust housing claims. Her key move is connecting housing to "freedom of intimate association"—the freedom to choose when and with whom we are in close relationships. Without stable housing, this freedom is systematically undermined: one cannot control who is present in one's living space, cannot exercise basic privacy rights, cannot form or maintain intimate relationships on one's own terms. The right to housing thus protects not merely negative liberty (freedom from interference) but positive conditions for autonomous life-planning (Wells 2018, 2022).

These accounts share important commonalities: all reject purely welfarist approaches that treat homelessness as merely lacking a good (shelter); all emphasize structural features of property systems; all connect housing to fundamental freedoms. But they diverge on remedy: Waldron suggests expanded commons, Essert emphasizes property rights transfer, Wells grounds claims in autonomy. Each illuminates different normative dimensions of homelessness. Yet all three accounts remain underspecified on crucial implementation questions: What exactly do homeless persons have claims to? Emergency shelter? Secure tenancy? Home ownership? And who bears correlative obligations? These questions require integration with distributive justice theories—the subject of the next section.

# Philosophical Perspectives on "Home": A Literature Review for Encyclopedia Article

## Introduction

Home occupies a peculiar position in contemporary philosophical inquiry. While seemingly a mundane, readily understood concept—a dwelling, a place where one lives—closer investigation reveals home to be philosophically complex, normatively contested, and analytically under-theorized (Fox 2016). What distinguishes a home from a mere house or shelter? What makes homelessness not just a material deprivation but a distinctive form of injustice? How does home function as a site of both security and oppression, belonging and exclusion? These questions sit at the intersection of ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, and social theory, yet philosophical engagement with them remained relatively sparse until the 1990s.

The past three decades have witnessed a renaissance in philosophical work on home, driven primarily by analytical and applied ethics approaches rather than continental phenomenology. While Heidegger's writings on dwelling and Bachelard's poetics of space remain influential, recent philosophical work emphasizes conceptual clarity, normative argument, and engagement with empirical realities of housing crises, homelessness, displacement, and inequality. As Jenkins and Brownlee observe, "analytic philosophy has largely neglected homelessness" and the social functions of home (2022, 441), but this neglect is being corrected through sustained attention to housing justice, homelessness ethics, and the normative dimensions of domestic space.

This review focuses on analytical and applied philosophical work from 1990 to the present, organized around six major debates: (1) conceptual foundations distinguishing home from house and shelter; (2) the ethics of homelessness, particularly freedom-based and property-rights approaches; (3) housing justice and distributive justice frameworks; (4) feminist philosophical perspectives on gendered dimensions of home; (5) displacement, migration, and exile ethics; and (6) urban justice, NIMBY-ism, and housing policy. Throughout, I emphasize key tensions, identify research gaps, and highlight work that bridges philosophical theory with housing policy and empirical research.

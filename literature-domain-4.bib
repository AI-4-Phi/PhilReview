DOMAIN 4: Urban Housing Markets and Spatial Dimensions
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-13
PAPERS_FOUND: 12
GEOGRAPHIC_FOCUS: Germany (Berlin, Munich, Hamburg), Europe
SEARCH_SOURCES: Google Scholar, urban studies journals, DIW Berlin, real estate research
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines urban housing dynamics, city-level rent variation, rising housing costs
in German cities, gentrification, displacement, and spatial dimensions of housing affordability.
Focus on Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg as high-cost urban markets. Research documents that rents
in major German cities (A-cities) increased 70% from 2011-2024, with particularly sharp rises
post-2010. Urban-rural divide shows cities with 2% vacancy vs. 7.6% in eastern rural areas.
Housing supply constraints, construction costs, and migration patterns affect urban burden
distribution. Key question: do median-income households maintain stable burdens despite rising
costs (spatial adjustment) or face increasing burdens?

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Tests Hypothesis 1 (flat burdens for median income despite rising costs) and Hypothesis 2
(high burdens for low-income urban dwellers). Spatial variation critical for understanding
where housing burden concentrated.

KEY_DEBATES:
- Urban-rural housing cost gradients
- Gentrification and displacement mechanisms
- Housing supply elasticity in German cities
- Rent control effectiveness in tight urban markets

Control variables: Location, dwelling characteristics, time, rent control status. Main findings: German rent control promotes gentrification and amplifies supply shortage of moderately priced living space. Causal negative effect of rent control on yield of rental objects subject to regulation. Rising yields for exempted objects suggests regulation contributed to gentrification via shift of rental housing supply away from regulated segment. Dwellings in municipalities with rent control rented out in worse condition once implemented. Relevance to hypotheses: H1 (urban rent dynamics), H2 (impact on affordable housing supply).}

  note = {Geography: Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Düsseldorf. Time period: 2014-2016 (around 2015 Mietpreisbremse introduction). Data source: ImmobilienScout24 listings. Control variables: Dwelling characteristics, location, time trends. Main findings: Difference-in-difference estimation shows rent brake reduced rents on offer in Hamburg, Berlin and Munich by up to 5%, while no effects in Cologne and Düsseldorf. Overall effect of rent control -1.4%, remarkably lower than effects in other literature. Effects lagging behind expected effects almost everywhere, illustrating implementation deficit. Effect vanished about one year after implementation. Relevance to hypotheses: H1 (urban rent trends and policy responses), H2 (limited effectiveness for affordability).}

  note = {Geography: German cities with/without rent control. Time period: 2012-2017. Data source: ImmobilienScout24. Control variables: City characteristics, dwelling attributes, regional economic indicators. Main findings: Neighborhoods with higher price levels show stronger effects of rent control implementation, with maximum decreases up to 8% in high-price neighborhoods vs 4% in low-price neighborhoods. Effects vanish over time in every subgroup. Triple difference event study approach found rent control had significant success initially, dampening rental prices by up to 5% for all dwellings (up to 9% for specific types), but effect disappeared about one year after implementation. Relevance to hypotheses: H1 (spatial variation in rent dynamics), H2 (policy impacts on burden).}

  note = {Geography: Germany, focus on major cities (Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg). Time period: 2020-2024. Data source: Market transactions, construction permits, rent indices. Main findings: Germany needs 320,000 new dwellings per year between 2023-2030, with Berlin requiring 23,000 annually and Munich 11,300. New housing completions remain well below federal target of 400,000 units per year. Building permits issued fell by 27%. Production costs for residential buildings increased around 40% since 2020. In large cities total cost of new builds increased to more than EUR 5,000 per sqm. Munich has lowest vacancy rate at 0.2%. Relevance to hypotheses: H1 (supply constraints and urban costs), H2 (new construction barriers affect affordability).}

  note = {Geography: Germany including urban-rural breakdown. Time period: 1993-2013. Data source: SOEP, EVS. Control variables: Location (city size), age, household structure. Main findings: Declining relative costs of homeownership versus renting, changes in household structure, declining real incomes for low-income households and residential mobility towards larger cities all contribute to rising housing inequality. Younger cohorts spend more on housing and save less than older cohorts did at same age. Migration to larger cities puts pressure on urban housing markets. Relevance to hypotheses: H1 (urban migration and housing costs), H2 (low-income urban burden), H4 (income changes explain burden).}

Main findings: More than 15% of Berlin respondents experienced direct displacement, with rent increases after refurbishment or property sales proving most common triggers. Berlin gains 40,000 inhabitants per year but only constructing 15,000 new dwellings annually. Displacement concentrated among renters and lower-income households. Relevance to hypotheses: H1 (urban housing pressures), H2 (low-income vulnerability to displacement).}

In larger cities, rising housing costs also associated with increasing outflows. Residential asking rents per m² increased by 4% per year between 2011-2017 (around 26% cumulative).

Urban centers like Berlin and Munich struggle with soaring rents and housing shortages while rural areas have empty properties. Berlin and other urban centers have just 2% vacancy rates reflecting intense demand and rising rents, whereas eastern Germany has vacancy rate of 7.6%.

Main findings: Unlike most other European countries and US, real house prices declined since 1980s in Germany. Four factors explain low homeownership: extensive social housing sector, high transfer taxes, no mortgage interest deductibility, and conservative lending policies. Rental housing stock generally well-maintained and apartments in rental and owner-occupied markets of similar quality. Large non-stigmatized rental sector reduces pressure for homeownership. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (rental market structure affects burden distribution), institutional context for high rental share.}

German and Swedish households are worst off when it comes to housing costs, with median households paying more than 16% of disposable income on living costs. Substantial shares of cash renters in Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden received housing allowances. Relevance to hypotheses: Comparative context for German housing system, H2 (rental burden and housing allowances).}

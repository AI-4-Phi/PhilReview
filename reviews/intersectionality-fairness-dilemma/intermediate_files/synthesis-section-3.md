## Section 2: Ontological Uncertainty—The Social Construction of Intersectional Groups

While technical ML approaches to intersectional fairness have achieved computational tractability through multicalibration and sparse data methods, these solutions uniformly assume that the set of protected groups can be specified in advance. This assumption confronts a fundamental challenge from philosophy: deep disagreement about how social groups are constituted and which intersectional categories exist. Philosophical debates reveal competing frameworks—attribute-based accounts treating groups as combinations of demographic features versus practice-based accounts arguing groups are constituted through social roles, conferral, and structural positioning—that yield incompatible answers about which intersections warrant recognition. This ontological uncertainty is not resolvable through better conceptual analysis; it reflects fundamental disagreement about social reality's structure.

### Subsection 2.1: Intersectionality—Emergence vs. Reduction

Intersectionality theory itself divides over a foundational metaphysical question: whether intersectional experiences emerge as novel phenomena from the conjunction of social categories, or can be reduced to combinations of independent category effects. Jorba and López de Sa (2024) develop the most sophisticated recent defense of emergence, proposing that intersectional experiences arise when social structures make category conjunctions relevant for discrimination and privilege. Crucially, their account maintains "metaphysical neutrality"—compatible with multiple ontologies of base categories—while arguing for "explanatory flexibility" that allows context-dependent emergence. On this view, "Black woman" is not merely a label for the conjunction of being Black and being a woman; rather, the category emerges when specific social structures treat this conjunction distinctly. The emergence framework has direct implications for algorithmic group specification: if relevant categories emerge contextually from how social structures operate, algorithms cannot pre-specify all intersections through combinatorial enumeration of attributes. Fairness systems must remain open to discovering which intersections matter in specific contexts.

Bernstein (2020) sharpens the metaphysical stakes by asking whether intersectional identities are ontologically novel or reducible to constituent categories. Her analysis examines grounding relations: does "Black woman" as a social kind depend on (is grounded in) the categories "Black" and "woman," or does it constitute an independent kind with its own causal powers? This is not merely terminological. If intersectional categories are strongly emergent with novel properties, fairness metrics must recognize them as primitive; if they are reducible, combinatorial approaches suffice. The philosophical debate parallels a technical choice in ML fairness: whether to treat intersections as derived features (attribute combinations) or independent variables requiring separate measurement.

Agent-based modeling research by O'Connor, Bright, and Bruner (2019) demonstrates that intersectional disadvantage can emerge from bargaining dynamics even when only single-axis disadvantages are explicitly encoded. Their simulations show that structural features of coordination problems generate emergent intersectional patterns—Black women face compound disadvantage exceeding the sum of racial and gender effects—without assuming intersectionality at the outset. This finding bridges analytical precision and emergent complexity, suggesting that fairness interventions must consider how algorithmic systems may generate intersectional harms through interaction effects even when intersections aren't explicitly represented. The formal modeling substantiates emergence claims through causal mechanisms rather than phenomenological description.

The emergence position confronts an additive alternative. Yuval-Davis (2006) traces this debate through British feminist theory, contrasting models where categories function as "separate axes summing to total oppression" with "mutually constitutive" frameworks where categories co-construct each other's meaning. Additive models are computationally tractable—fairness metrics can sum disparities across dimensions—but Yuval-Davis argues they "fail to capture how categories shape each other's significance in specific contexts." A Black woman's gender oppression differs qualitatively from a white woman's because race and gender are not independent variables but mutually constituting dimensions of experience. This creates a fundamental tension for algorithmic implementation: mutual constitution resists the decomposition into independent features that computational methods require.

Critical voices within Black feminist theory resist the entire project of formalizing intersectionality. Collins (2019) positions intersectionality as "critical inquiry and praxis" rather than neutral analytic framework, emphasizing how power relations are "mutually constructing across domains—structural, disciplinary, cultural, interpersonal." On this view, treating intersectionality as a technical problem of measuring compound effects domesticates its radical potential as critique of categorical thinking itself. Carastathis (2016) similarly warns against "premature calls to operationalize intersectionality," arguing it should remain a "horizon of future thinking" rather than an "arrived achievement" subject to codification. These critiques suggest that algorithmic attempts to specify intersectional groups face not just technical challenges but resistance from the very theoretical tradition they invoke: intersectionality may be fundamentally at odds with the formalization fairness metrics require.

The emergence-reduction debate is not merely academic. If intersectional categories emerge contextually when social structures make conjunctions salient (Jorba and López de Sa 2024), then there is no fixed set of groups for fairness auditing—relevant categories shift across contexts. If categories are mutually constitutive rather than additive (Yuval-Davis 2006), then combinatorial approaches that enumerate attribute combinations will systematically fail to identify morally relevant groups. And if intersectionality is critical inquiry rather than neutral framework (Collins 2019, Carastathis 2016), then no technical operationalization can be politically innocent. This ontological openness—the possibility that new intersections emerge, that category meanings shift, that formalization distorts—constitutes irreducible uncertainty for algorithmic group specification.

### Subsection 2.2: Social Ontology—Attribute-Based vs. Practice-Based Group Constitution

Beneath debates about intersectionality lie foundational questions in social ontology about how any social groups are constituted. The dominant framework in ML fairness—treating groups as defined by shared demographic attributes that can be combined mechanically—reflects what philosophers call an "attribute-based" account. Practice-based alternatives developed by Haslanger, Mallon, Ásta, and Ritchie argue instead that social groups are constituted through norms, roles, conferral, and structural positioning that cannot be reduced to observable features. This philosophical divide has direct consequences: if practice-based accounts are correct, algorithmic approaches that derive groups from attributes systematically misidentify morally relevant categories.

Haslanger's (2012) political constructionism provides the most influential challenge to attribute-based models. On her view, race and gender are "social positions constituted by systematic relations of subordination and privilege," not collections of individuals who share intrinsic properties. What makes someone a woman, on this ameliorative analysis, is being "systematically subordinated on the basis of observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of reproductive capacities" (Haslanger 2005, 12). Crucially, group membership is defined not by possessing certain attributes but by occupying a position within hierarchical social structures. Two individuals with identical observable features might occupy different social positions depending on how they are treated, recognized, and positioned by institutions. This structural definition directly undermines attribute-based algorithmic specification: the morally salient aspect of group membership (systematic subordination or privilege) is not reducible to demographic features measurable in datasets but depends on social relations and practices that algorithms cannot directly observe.

Mallon (2016) develops a sophisticated middle position through his account of social kinds as homeostatic property clusters (HPC) stabilized by social roles. On this view, social categories like race and gender are real and explanatorily useful because social roles create systematic correlations between properties—not through biology but through mechanisms like stereotype threat, discrimination, and social norms. A social role generates stable patterns where certain attributes cluster together, making categories scientifically tractable despite their social construction. However, Mallon's framework also reveals the contingency and context-dependence of these correlations: social roles can shift, categories can be reconfigured, and what counts as a relevant grouping depends on historically specific practices. For algorithmic fairness, this means that even when statistical patterns correspond to social groups, these patterns are artifacts of contingent social structures rather than natural divisions. The "right" groups cannot be read off from demographic correlations without understanding the social mechanisms that produce group-differentiated outcomes—mechanisms that vary across contexts and can change over time.

Ásta's (2018) conferralist framework pushes further, arguing that individuals possess social properties "in virtue of communal conferral rather than intrinsic features." On this view, social categories are constituted through practices where communities collectively confer properties onto individuals based on contextually salient characteristics. The same constellation of attributes can ground different social properties in different contexts. Crucially, conferral can be contested, mistaken, or refused—someone classified as a woman by institutional systems may reject that classification, and which classification matters depends on which community's conferral is operative in that context. For intersectional fairness, conferralism creates fundamental indeterminacy: there is no algorithm-independent fact about which combinations of attributes constitute morally relevant groups, since what matters is how communities confer meaning onto combinations through situated interpretive practices. A demographic category like "Hispanic woman" might be conferred differently across institutional contexts (census, employment, criminal justice), and these differences are not mere measurement error but reflect genuinely distinct social properties constituted through different conferral practices.

Ritchie (2018) offers perhaps the most radical departure from attribute-based models through her structural ontology. On this view, social groups are not collections of individuals who share attributes but "networks of relations constitutively dependent on social factors" (629). What makes a collection a social group is not shared properties of members but the pattern of relations between them. Gender groups, racial groups, and other social categories are structures—nodes (individuals) connected by asymmetric, contextual, socially mediated relations—rather than classes defined by common features. This structural account fundamentally challenges combinatorial approaches to intersectionality: if groups are constituted by relational patterns rather than attribute combinations, then specifying groups through demographic feature enumeration misconstrues their ontology. The relational positioning that defines group membership is not captured by individual-level attributes measurable in datasets. An algorithm that identifies "Black women" by selecting individuals with race=Black and gender=woman may capture a statistical category but miss the social structure—the network of relations—that constitutes the group.

Thomasson (2019) complicates matters further by arguing for ontological pluralism about social groups. Different types of groups—gender groups, racial groups, disability groups, socioeconomic classes—may have fundamentally different constitution conditions. Some might be attribute-based, others practice-based, still others structurally constituted. If this pluralism is correct, there cannot be a single algorithmic method for identifying all protected groups. What works for specifying income brackets (arguably attribute-based) will fail for gender (plausibly conferral-based on Ásta's account) and race (structural positioning on Ritchie's view). This pluralism creates irreducible ontological uncertainty: not only is there disagreement about how any particular group is constituted, but there is meta-level disagreement about whether all groups share a common ontological structure.

Recent work by Popescu-Sarry (2023) radicalizes the constructionist critique by arguing that discrimination does not apply to pre-existing groups but rather constitutes groups through differential treatment. On this view, protected characteristics are not given inputs to fairness analysis but contested outputs of discriminatory practices that (re)negotiate social reality. If discrimination itself constructs the groups it targets—treating people as members creates membership—then algorithmic fairness systems that take groups as pre-specified fundamentally misunderstand the phenomenon. The politics of group specification cannot be bracketed as a preliminary technical question because specifying which groups exist is inseparable from the ongoing process through which discrimination constitutes social reality.

These practice-based accounts converge on a challenge to attribute-based algorithmic specification: social groups cannot be adequately captured by demographic feature combinations because group membership is constituted through social structures (Haslanger), contingent role-based mechanisms (Mallon), communal conferral practices (Ásta), relational networks (Ritchie), or discriminatory processes themselves (Popescu-Sarry). These constitution processes resist algorithmic discovery from demographic data. While computational methods can identify statistical patterns, they cannot determine which patterns correspond to morally relevant groups without substantive social-ontological commitments that remain contested. This is ontological uncertainty in its deepest form: not merely disagreement about which groups exist, but fundamental conflict about what it is for a group to exist.

### Subsection 2.3: Methodological Tensions—Ameliorative Analysis and Regulative Ideals

The ontological debates between attribute-based and practice-based accounts are compounded by methodological questions about how to conduct conceptual analysis of social kinds. Should we describe how social categories function in ordinary usage, or should we design improved concepts for emancipatory purposes? This methodological divide—between descriptive and ameliorative analysis—suggests that ontological questions about which groups exist may be partly normative rather than purely empirical or metaphysical, further deepening uncertainty.

Haslanger's (2005) ameliorative approach explicitly rejects purely descriptive analysis of social kinds. Her methodology asks: what concepts of race, gender, and other categories would be most useful for feminist and antiracist critique? This yields definitions potentially diverging from ordinary usage—defining women as "those systematically subordinated on the basis of observed or imagined bodily features" captures what matters for feminist politics but may not match folk concepts. The justification is that ordinary concepts may themselves be ideological, obscuring power relations that critical analysis aims to expose. For algorithmic fairness, ameliorative analysis implies that relevant groups may not be those defined by demographic conventions or common usage but those tracking structural positions of subordination and privilege. Standard demographic categories used in datasets—themselves products of institutional practices like census design—may not capture normatively salient divisions.

Jones (2014) examines whether ameliorative analysis can accommodate intersectionality, questioning whether Black women's subordination requires an integrated account or can be analyzed through separate race and gender analyses. Her discussion reveals a tension: if categories are defined amelioratively by their role in oppression, and intersectional positions face distinctive forms of oppression irreducible to constituent categories, then ameliorative analysis should recognize intersections as primitive. But which intersections? The ameliorative framework lacks resources for determining which conjunctions constitute independent sites of oppression versus which are reducible to component effects. This indeterminacy within ameliorative analysis itself shows that even philosophically sophisticated approaches to group specification face unresolved questions about intersectional boundaries.

Gasdaglis and Madva (2020) propose a different methodological stance that sidesteps ontological commitments entirely. They argue intersectionality should be understood as a "regulative ideal"—a guiding methodological principle rather than substantive metaphysical or empirical thesis. On this interpretation, intersectionality directs us to remain attentive to how categories interact in producing inequality without requiring metaphysical claims about emergence, grounding, or constitution. Existing classification schemes should be treated as "indefinitely mutually informing" and "provisional," always open to revision as we discover new patterns of injustice. This pragmatist move avoids regress problems (which intersections count?) by refusing to fix categories in advance.

The regulative ideal interpretation has attractive features for algorithmic fairness: it suggests systems should treat groups as provisional hypotheses subject to ongoing revision rather than fixed ontological facts. However, it also reveals a fundamental tension: fairness auditing requires specifying which groups to measure, yet regulative ideals provide methodological guidance without delivering determinate groups. A system designer cannot audit "all groups that matter" without some way of determining which groups those are. The regulative approach may show that ontological uncertainty is a feature rather than a bug—categories should remain contestable—but this feature is incompatible with algorithmic systems requiring fixed group definitions for computational tractability.

These methodological debates compound ontological uncertainty in a specific way: they suggest there may be no politically neutral, purely descriptive answer to which groups exist. If the relevant question is ameliorative (which categories serve emancipatory purposes?), then group specification becomes a normative rather than empirical question—and normative questions admit of plural reasonable answers. If intersectionality functions as regulative ideal rather than fixed theory, then any attempt to codify groups for algorithmic purposes violates its methodological spirit by prematurely closing what should remain open. The ontological uncertainty revealed by social ontology is thus not merely a gap in our knowledge but reflects the normative and political dimensions of social classification itself.

---

**Section Summary**: Philosophical examination of social groups reveals deep ontological uncertainty irreducible to better conceptual analysis. Intersectionality theory divides between emergence frameworks (intersections as novel categories) and reductive approaches (intersections as attribute combinations), with critical traditions resisting formalization entirely. Social ontology offers competing accounts—attribute-based models assuming groups are defined by shared features versus practice-based accounts arguing constitution through roles, conferral, relations, and structural positioning. These disagreements are not terminological but reflect fundamental conflicts about social reality's structure. Methodological debates add further complexity: ameliorative analysis makes group specification partly normative, while regulative approaches reject fixed categorization. For algorithmic fairness, this ontological uncertainty means there is no determinate, politically neutral set of groups to specify—different metaphysical and normative commitments yield different answers about which intersections exist and matter.

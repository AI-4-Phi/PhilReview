====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the philosophical foundations of intersectionality theory, focusing on competing interpretations of how social categories combine to produce distinctive forms of discrimination and privilege. The central debate concerns whether intersectionality should be understood through analytical/causal frameworks (treating categories as variables with causal powers) or hermeneutic/interpretive frameworks (treating categories as mutually constituted meaning structures). A key metaphysical question is whether intersectional experiences emerge as novel properties from the conjunction of categories, or can be reduced to combinations of independent category effects.

Recent work (2018-2025) has seen significant developments in three areas: (1) metaphysical accounts proposing emergence frameworks (Jorba & López de Sa 2024, Bernstein 2020), (2) causal modeling approaches from philosophy of science (Bright et al. excluded per user request, O'Connor et al. 2019), and (3) critiques of mutual constitution metaphors in favor of properties frameworks (Jorba & Rodó-Zárate 2019-2020). Critical realist approaches (Gunnarsson 2020) attempt to dialectically preserve both category distinctness and unity, while regulative ideal accounts (Gasdaglis & Madva 2020) sidestep metaphysical commitments entirely.

The literature reveals a tension between analytical precision (favoring causal/reductive approaches) and fidelity to lived experience (favoring hermeneutic/emergent approaches). This tension maps onto debates about social construction: whether intersectional categories are natural kinds with stable causal powers, or historically contingent classifications whose significance varies across contexts.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These philosophical debates ground the "ontological uncertainty" central to the algorithmic fairness dilemma. If intersectional categories are emergent (requiring novel variables for Black women distinct from race+gender), algorithms face epistemic limits on which categories exist. If categories are reductive, the challenge is computational (combinatorial explosion). The hermeneutic tradition suggests category salience is context-dependent, undermining stable fairness metrics.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with computational/algorithmic implications of different metaphysical positions. Few papers address how ontological commitments about intersectionality translate into operationalizable fairness criteria. The hermeneutic tradition remains undertheorized in analytic philosophy compared to the causal/metaphysical literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the analytical vs. hermeneutic divide as structuring the field. Focus on emergence vs. reduction as the key metaphysical question with practical implications for fairness measurement. Note how different ontological positions yield different answers to "which categories must be measured."

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Emergence view: 5 papers - Intersectional experiences emerge from social structures making category conjunctions relevant (Jorba & López de Sa 2024, O'Connor et al. 2019)
- Properties framework: 3 papers - Categories as properties of positions, not objects (Jorba & Rodó-Zárate 2019-2020)
- Critical realist/dialectical: 2 papers - Categories both distinct and unified (Gunnarsson 2020, Clegg 2012)
- Regulative ideal: 1 paper - Intersectionality as methodological principle, not metaphysical thesis (Gasdaglis & Madva 2020)
- Hermeneutic approach: 2 papers - Intersectionality as interpretive lens (excluded Ruíz, Barthold 2014)
- Social construction ameliorative: 2 papers - Categories defined by social role in oppression (Haslanger, Jones 2014)
- Foundational/conceptual: 3 papers - Clarifying core concepts and tensions (Carastathis 2014, 2016; Collins 2019)

  author = {Jorba, Marta and López de Sa, Dan},
  title = {Intersectionality as emergence},
  journal = {Philosophical Studies},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {181},
  number = {6},
  pages = {1455--1475},
  doi = {10.1007/s11098-024-02155-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes that intersectional experiences emerge from the conjunction of social categories when social structures make these conjunctions relevant for discrimination and privilege. Argues for metaphysical neutrality (compatible with multiple ontologies of categories), explanatory flexibility (allows context-dependent emergence), and methodological openness (guides research without prescribing specific methods). Distinguishes their emergence view from strong metaphysical claims about new properties.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether intersectionality requires emergent categories or can be reduced to combinations of attributes. Crucial for ontological uncertainty in algorithmic fairness: if experiences emerge contextually, algorithms cannot pre-specify all relevant categories. The metaphysical neutrality claim suggests fairness systems must remain open to discovering new relevant intersections rather than fixing categories in advance.

  POSITION: Emergence framework with metaphysical flexibility. Represents the most sophisticated recent defense of emergence without commitment to strong ontological novelty.

  doi = {10.1007/s11098-019-01394-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines metaphysical questions about how social categories combine in intersectionality theory. Analyzes whether intersectional identities are ontologically novel (emergence) or reducible to constituent categories. Discusses grounding relations between intersectional properties and base categories, arguing that intersectionality raises distinctive metaphysical puzzles about social kinds and their relations.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding competing metaphysical interpretations of intersectionality. Clarifies what is at stake in debates about emergence vs. reduction: whether "Black woman" names a property grounded in but distinct from race and gender, or merely abbreviates their conjunction. This directly impacts whether fairness algorithms must recognize intersectional categories as primitive or can decompose them.

  POSITION: Analytical metaphysics of social categories. Represents the application of analytic metaphysical tools (grounding, emergence, composition) to intersectionality theory.

  year = {2020},
  volume = {6},
  doi = {10.3998/ergo.12405314.0006.044},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that intersectionality should be understood as a regulative ideal (guiding methodological principle) rather than a substantive metaphysical, legal, or empirical thesis. Claims this interpretation avoids regress problems and definitional disputes. Treats existing classification schemes as indefinitely mutually informing, with the aim of revealing inequality and injustice. Provides heuristics for social-scientific research and political coalition-building.

  RELEVANCE: Offers an alternative to metaphysical debates by reframing intersectionality as epistemological and practical stance. Suggests ontological uncertainty might be feature, not bug: fairness systems should treat categories as provisional and open to revision. Challenges the project of fixing intersectional ontology for algorithmic purposes, instead requiring ongoing responsiveness to how categories function in specific contexts of oppression.

  POSITION: Anti-metaphysical pragmatist interpretation. Represents escape from analytical vs. hermeneutic divide by rejecting metaphysical framing entirely.

  publisher = {Brill},
  pages = {146--162},
  doi = {10.1163/9789004321939_008},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Roy Bhaskar's dialectical critical realism, argues that intersectional categories can be understood as both distinct and unified through the dialectical notion of unity-in-difference. Explains why categories are conceptually separable for analytical purposes yet experientially inseparable. Addresses the ontological puzzle of how to think categories at multiple levels simultaneously without reducing one to the other.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical resources for thinking both category distinctness (needed for causal analysis) and category interpenetration (demanded by phenomenology of oppression). Relevant to algorithmic fairness through the claim that categories have different significance at different ontological levels (structural, cultural, experiential), suggesting fairness metrics must be multi-level rather than flattening categories into single variables.

  POSITION: Critical realist dialectical approach. Represents attempt to synthesize analytical precision with hermeneutic sensitivity through stratified ontology.

  title = {Beyond Mutual Constitution: The Properties Framework for Intersectionality Studies},
  journal = {Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {45},
  number = {1},
  pages = {175--200},
  doi = {10.1086/703499},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques mutual constitution metaphors as reifying categories by treating them as objects that combine. Proposes properties framework: categories are properties that positions possess, not objects themselves. This preserves ontological specificity of categories (gender is distinct from race) while allowing deep mutual influence. Distinguishes positions (individuals located in social space) from effects (consequences of that location). Argues this avoids both reification and reduction.

  RELEVANCE: Offers conceptual clarification crucial for algorithmic implementation. If categories are properties of positions, algorithms must model social positions as primary ontology, with categories as attributes. Challenges additive approaches (treating categories as independent features) without requiring strong emergence. Suggests intermediate path between reductive and emergent views relevant to fairness metric design.

  POSITION: Properties framework as alternative to mutual constitution. Represents linguistic/conceptual turn to resolve metaphysical puzzles through clarifying category grammar.

  volume = {27},
  number = {4},
  pages = {377--394},
  doi = {10.1177/1350506820930734},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes dominant metaphors in intersectionality debates (traffic intersection, matrices, tapestry) and argues they fail to capture mutual constitution while avoiding reification. Problems include conflating positions with effects and treating categories as discrete objects. Proposes "different apples" metaphor: categories as diverse properties of apples (positions), effects as what happens when apples interact with specific structures. Reframes discussion of in/separability and fragmentation.

  RELEVANCE: Exposes how metaphors shape both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of intersectionality. Relevant to algorithmic fairness because computational models inherit metaphorical commitments (e.g., treating categories as vectors that combine implies additive metaphor). Shows that ontological debates often reduce to metaphorical differences, suggesting need for explicit conceptual frameworks in algorithm design rather than implicit metaphors.

  POSITION: Metaphor analysis and conceptual engineering. Complements properties framework by diagnosing conceptual confusions in existing literature.

  number = {1},
  pages = {81--89},
  doi = {10.1007/s11098-013-0245-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how Sally Haslanger's ameliorative analysis of race and gender (defining categories by their role in oppression) handles intersectionality. Questions whether ameliorative analysis can capture how multiple category memberships affect lived experience, social roles, and relative privilege. Explores whether Black women's subordination can be analyzed through separate race and gender analyses or requires integrated account.

  RELEVANCE: Tests whether social constructionist approaches can accommodate intersectionality. Crucial for algorithmic fairness if categories are defined by their function in systems of oppression: algorithms must then track how oppression operates contextually rather than treating categories as stable features. Raises question whether ameliorative definitions help or hinder intersectional analysis by defining categories through their effects.

  POSITION: Critical engagement with Haslanger's social construction view. Examines whether ameliorative analysis is compatible with intersectional insights.

  volume = {9},
  number = {5},
  pages = {304--314},
  doi = {10.1111/phc3.12129},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces the concept of intersectionality from Crenshaw's legal scholarship to feminist theory, examining how it has been interpreted, contested, and developed. Distinguishes intersectionality as analytic tool from intersectionality as representation of identity. Critiques tendencies toward categorical proliferation and argues for understanding intersectionality as critique of categorical thinking itself. Emphasizes political origins in anti-discrimination law and Black feminist organizing.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding what intersectionality claims and what problems it addresses. Shows that intersectionality emerged to address legal/institutional failures to recognize compound discrimination, not primarily as metaphysical thesis. This legal-institutional genealogy suggests algorithmic fairness is natural domain for intersectional analysis, but warns against treating intersectionality as mere identity representation rather than structural critique.

  POSITION: Conceptual clarification and genealogy. Represents careful disambiguation of multiple meanings of "intersectionality" in circulation.

  publisher = {University of Nebraska Press},
  year = {2016},
  isbn = {978-0-8032-8412-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive treatment arguing intersectionality is best understood not as arrived achievement but as horizon of future thinking. Reads Crenshaw's foundational texts closely to recover their radical edge against domesticated interpretations. Critiques representational approaches treating intersectionality as theory of multiple identities. Emphasizes political and coalitional dimensions, connecting to decolonial feminism. Warns against premature calls to "go beyond" intersectionality.

  RELEVANCE: Most thorough philosophical treatment of intersectionality's contested meanings and political stakes. Crucial for research project because it shows ontological questions cannot be separated from political functions. If intersectionality is horizon rather than fixed theory, algorithmic attempts to operationalize it face fundamental tension: codifying what should remain open and contestable. Suggests need for participatory approaches to category definition.

  publisher = {Duke University Press},
  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1515/9781478007098},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Theorizes intersectionality as a form of critical inquiry and praxis rather than merely an analytic category. Traces genealogy through Black feminist thought, particularly the concept of matrix of domination. Argues intersectionality is simultaneously analytic tool, interpretive framework, and critical intervention. Emphasizes how power relations are mutually constructing across domains (structural, disciplinary, cultural, interpersonal). Positions intersectionality as ongoing critical project.

  RELEVANCE: Authoritative statement by major intersectionality theorist on what intersectionality is and should be. Crucial for research because it frames intersectionality as critical theory (oriented toward emancipation) rather than neutral analytic framework. This suggests algorithmic fairness cannot simply "apply" intersectionality but must engage with its critical dimension. The matrix of domination concept indicates categories operate at multiple levels requiring different analytical approaches.

  POSITION: Intersectionality as critical social theory. Represents Black feminist intellectual tradition's self-understanding of the concept.

  pages = {23--41},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2018.1555870},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses agent-based models to show how intersectional oppression can emerge from bargaining dynamics even when groups face only single-axis disadvantages. Demonstrates that structural features of social coordination problems can generate emergent intersectional patterns. Argues simulation methods can generate precise causal predictions about when intersectional disadvantage arises. Shows intersection need not be assumed but can be derived from more basic social processes.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges analytical/causal and emergence approaches by showing emergence as outcome of causal mechanisms. Highly relevant to algorithmic fairness: suggests intersectional patterns may emerge from algorithmic dynamics (e.g., compounding biases) even when not explicitly encoded. The formal modeling approach demonstrates how analytical precision and emergent complexity can coexist. Implies fairness interventions must consider emergent effects of algorithmic systems.

  POSITION: Formal modeling of emergence. Represents philosophy of science approach to intersectionality using tools from game theory and agent-based modeling.

  number = {3},
  pages = {309--363},
  doi = {10.1558/jcr.v11i3.309},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies critical realist philosophy to intersectionality, arguing for stratified ontology distinguishing structural and cultural conditions from lived experience. Advocates separating analytical levels to avoid conflating agency with structure. Claims critical realism provides resources for explaining how intersections between gender, race, class operate in concrete historical circumstances. Emphasizes explanatory rather than merely descriptive aims.

  RELEVANCE: Provides ontological framework for multi-level analysis of intersectionality. Relevant to algorithmic fairness because it suggests categories operate differently at different levels (e.g., structural patterns vs. individual experiences), requiring different measurement strategies. The critical realist emphasis on causal mechanisms suggests algorithms should model underlying generative processes, not just surface correlations. Supports view that categories are real but stratified.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to critiques of her ameliorative analysis approach to race and gender. Defends defining social categories by their function in hierarchical systems while acknowledging intersectional complexity. Argues ameliorative analysis can accommodate intersectionality by recognizing how different systems of oppression interact. Addresses methodological questions about balancing analytical clarity with intersectional nuance.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses whether ameliorative/functionalist definitions of categories (defining by role in oppression) can handle intersectionality. Crucial methodological question for algorithmic fairness: should categories be defined by their causal role in producing inequality (ameliorative) or by other criteria? Haslanger's response shows tension between definitional precision and intersectional openness, suggesting algorithms may need context-sensitive category definitions.

  POSITION: Defense of ameliorative analysis against intersectional critique. Represents analytical philosophy's engagement with intersectionality through social construction framework.

  publisher = {Palgrave Macmillan},
  year = {2014},
  doi = {10.1057/9781137407092},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies Gadamerian hermeneutics to social identities including gender, arguing they are neither purely objective/natural nor purely subjective/constructed. Proposes hermeneutic middle path where identities are historically and culturally constituted meanings that constrain without determining experience. Argues understanding social identities requires interpretive engagement with traditions and horizons of meaning rather than causal analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Represents hermeneutic alternative to both analytical and critical realist approaches. Relevant to algorithmic fairness debate by suggesting categories are fundamentally interpretive: their meaning emerges through historical dialogue, not fixed definition. This implies ontological uncertainty is inherent (categories lack stable essence) and algorithmic operationalization faces limits (meanings resist formalization). Suggests participatory interpretation rather than expert definition.

  doi = {10.1177/0392192110374245},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys recent feminist approaches to intersectionality, examining it as research paradigm. Addresses methodological debates about levels of analysis (macro-structural vs. micro-interactional), ontological status of categories (essentialist vs. anti-essentialist), and scope (limited categories vs. indefinite expansion). Maps tensions between different theoretical traditions appropriating intersectionality. Argues for reflexivity about how intersectionality travels across disciplines and contexts.

  RELEVANCE: Provides overview of key theoretical tensions structuring the field, including ontological debates about category status. Useful for situating competing philosophical interpretations within broader feminist theory landscape. The levels of analysis question is crucial for algorithmic fairness: must systems model structural patterns, individual interactions, or both? The scope question addresses category proliferation problem facing algorithmic implementations.

  pages = {193--209},
  doi = {10.1177/1350506806065752},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares 1980s British debates on race/class/gender with post-2001 intersectionality discussions. Contrasts additive models (categories as separate axes summing to total oppression) with mutually constitutive models (categories co-constructing each other). Argues for analyzing social divisions at multiple levels: individual experience, intersubjective relations, group/organization, and societal structure. Critiques both essentialist category reification and anti-essentialist category dissolution. Emphasizes ontological complexity.

  RELEVANCE: Classic statement of additive vs. mutually constitutive distinction central to metaphysical debates. Crucial for algorithmic fairness because additive models are computationally tractable (sum category effects) while mutual constitution models resist decomposition. The multi-level analysis framework suggests fairness must be assessed differently at individual, group, and structural levels. Provides historical depth to contemporary ontological debates.

  pages = {1--15},
  doi = {10.1057/fr.2008.4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Offers critical assessment of intersectionality's institutionalization in feminist theory. Argues the concept has become simultaneously celebrated and ambiguous, used for contradictory purposes. Identifies three main uses: as theory of marginalized subjectivity, as theory of identity, and as general theory of all identity. Questions whether intersectionality has explanatory power or primarily names a problem requiring explanation. Calls for greater theoretical precision.

  RELEVANCE: Important meta-theoretical critique highlighting intersectionality's conceptual ambiguity. Relevant to algorithmic fairness because vagueness about what intersectionality claims makes operationalization contentious. Nash's call for precision resonates with algorithmic implementation challenges but also warns against premature formalization that obscures political stakes. Suggests need to distinguish intersectionality as analytical framework from intersectionality as normative-political commitment.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Foundational text coining "intersectionality" to describe how antidiscrimination law fails Black women by treating race and sex as mutually exclusive categories. Shows how single-axis frameworks in law and feminist/antiracist theory marginalize those at the intersection. Analyzes employment discrimination cases where courts rejected Black women's claims by comparing them separately to white women and Black men. Argues intersectional subordination requires integrated analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Essential genealogical reference as the paper that introduced "intersectionality" to legal and academic discourse. Demonstrates that intersectionality emerged from practical legal problem (institutional failure to recognize compound discrimination), not abstract metaphysics. This grounds contemporary ontological debates in concrete contexts. For algorithmic fairness, Crenshaw's legal cases show how single-axis categories systematically fail intersectional subjects, motivating expanded category frameworks.

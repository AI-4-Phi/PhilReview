I obtained data from a post-entry English language placement test administered at a public university in the United States. In addition to expectedly familiar American English, the test features Hawai\u2019i, Filipino, and Indian English, which are expectedly less familiar to our test takers, but justified by the context. I used confirmatory factor analysis to test whether the category of unfamiliar English items formed a latent factor distinct from the other category of more familiar American English items. I used Rasch-based differential item functioning analysis to examine item biases as a function of examinees\u2019 place of origin. The results from the confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the unfamiliar English items tapped into the same underlying construct as the familiar English items. The Rasch-based differential item functioning analysis revealed many instances of item bias among unfamiliar English items with higher proportions of item biases for items targeting narrow comprehension than broad comprehension. However, at the test level, the unfamiliar English items did not substantially influence raw total scores. These findings offer support for using a variety of Englishes in listening tests.",

      "abstract": "We propose measurement modeling from the quantitative social sciences as a\\nframework for understanding fairness in computational systems. Computational\\nsystems often involve unobservable theoretical constructs, such as\\nsocioeconomic status, teacher effectiveness, and risk of recidivism. Such\\nconstructs cannot be measured directly and must instead be inferred from\\nmeasurements of observable properties (and other unobservable theoretical\\nconstructs) thought to be related to them -- i.e., operationalized via a\\nmeasurement model. This process, which necessarily involves making assumptions,\\nintroduces the potential for mismatches between the theoretical understanding\\nof the construct purported to be measured and its operationalization. We argue\\nthat many of the harms discussed in the literature on fairness in computational\\nsystems are direct results of such mismatches. We show how some of these harms\\ncould have been anticipated and, in some cases, mitigated if viewed through the\\nlens of measurement modeling. To do this, we contribute fairness-oriented\\nconceptualizations of construct reliability and construct validity that unite\\ntraditions from political science, education, and psychology and provide a set\\nof tools for making explicit and testing assumptions about constructs and their\\noperationalizations. We then turn to fairness itself, an essentially contested\\nconstruct that has different theoretical understandings in different contexts.\\nWe argue that this contestedness underlies recent debates about fairness\\ndefinitions: although these debates appear to be about different\\noperationalizations, they are, in fact, debates about different theoretical\\nunderstandings of fairness. We show how measurement modeling can provide a\\nframework for getting to the core of these debates.\\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Physical functioning is a core outcome domain to be measured in nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). A panel of experts recommended the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to measure this domain. The original 24-item RMDQ and ODI 2.1a are recommended by their developers. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the 24-item RMDQ or the ODI 2.1a has better measurement properties than the other to measure physical functioning in adult patients with NSLBP. Data Sources Bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SportDiscus, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar), references of existing reviews, and citation tracking were the data sources. Study Selection Two reviewers selected studies performing a head-to-head comparison of measurement properties (reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of the 2 questionnaires. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of these studies. Data Extraction The studies' characteristics and results were extracted by 2 reviewers. A meta-analysis was conducted when there was sufficient clinical and methodological homogeneity among studies. Data Synthesis Nine articles were included, for a total of 11 studies assessing 5 measurement properties. All studies were classified as having poor or fair methodological quality. The ODI displayed better test-retest reliability and smaller measurement error, whereas the RMDQ presented better construct validity as a measure of physical functioning. There was conflicting evidence for both instruments regarding responsiveness and inconclusive evidence for internal consistency. Limitations The results of this review are not generalizable to all available versions of these questionnaires or to patients with specific causes for their LBP. Conclusions Based on existing head-to-head comparison studies, there are no strong reasons to prefer 1 of these 2 instruments to measure physical functioning in patients with NSLBP, but studies of higher quality are needed to confirm this conclusion. Foremost, content, structural, and cross-cultural validity of these questionnaires in patients with NSLBP should be assessed and compared.",

Using a case study on the fair gender income gap in Austria, we discuss how different design elements can be used to increase a vignette experiment\u2019s validity and reliability. With respect to the experimental design, the design elements considered include a confounded factorial design, a between-subjects factor, anchoring vignettes, and blocking by respondent strata and interviewers. The design elements for the sampling and survey design consist of stratification, covariate measurements, and the systematic assignment of vignette sets to respondents and interviewers. Moreover, the vignettes\u2019 construct validity is empirically validated with respect to the real gender income gap in Austria. We demonstrate how a broad range of design elements can successfully increase a vignette study\u2019s validity and reliability.",

      "abstract": "Research suggests that when leaders, as servant leaders, focus on their followers\u2019 needs, this can have a positive effect on organizational functioning. Yet results are inconsistent in establishing the strength of the relationships, limiting understanding of the theoretical impact and practical reach of the servant leadership ( SL ) construct. Using a quantitative meta\u2010analysis based on 130 independent studies, the current research provides evidence that SL has incremental predictive validity over transformational, authentic, and ethical leadership. Further, the link between SL and a range of individual\u2010 and team\u2010level behavioural outcomes can be partially explained by trust in the leader, procedural justice, and leader\u2013member exchange. The paper also explores moderators to better establish SL 's criterion\u2010related validity and to clarify the magnitude of effects across boundary conditions, such as research design, national culture, and industry. Practitioner points Servant leadership has predictive validity over other leadership approaches, and therefore, organizations would benefit by developing their current leaders into SL s. Organizations should aim to select SL s into influential positions: Training programmes and selection profiles and processes would need to be aligned and developed to capture attitudes and behaviours associated with SL inside and outside the organization. Servant leaderships should seek to create a culture that positively promotes the development of trust, fairness, and high\u2010quality leader\u2013follower relationships, as these conditions collectively enable the effects of SL to be transmitted onto desirable follower outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the most common tools for studying pro\u2010sociality is the dictator game, in which allocations to one's partner are often described in terms of altruism. However, the motivations driving these allocations may represent either emotional concern for others (compassion), adherence to social norms regarding fairness (politeness), or both. In this article, we apply personality psychology to the study of behavior in the dictator game, in which we examine the discriminant validity of distinct pro\u2010social constructs from the Big Five and HEXACO models in relation to allocations of wealth. Across four studies (Study 1: N = 192; Study 2: N = 212; Study 3: N = 304; Study 4: N = 90) utilizing both hypothetical and incentivized designs, we found that the politeness\u2014but not compassion\u2014aspect of Big Five Agreeableness, as well as HEXACO Honesty\u2010Humility, uniquely predicted dictator allocations within their respective personality models. These findings contribute to a growing literature indicating that the standard dictator game measures \u201cgood manners\u201d or adherence to norms concerning fairness, rather than pure emotional concern or compassionate motives, and have important implications for how this paradigm is used and interpreted in psychological research.",

It conceptualizes SWB as a sociopsychological benefit that people receive from tourism activities in parallel with behavioral intentions to visit the destination treated as economic benefit. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Xiamen city of Fujian Province, China, and a valid sample of 541 tourists was used for data analysis. Findings show that service fairness has more of an effect on behavioral intentions and SWB than service quality; and such differentiated effects can be partly attributed to the mediating role of satisfaction between the antecedent constructs (i.e, service fairness and service quality) and consequence constructs (i.e, behavioral intentions and tourist SWB). The results suggest that tourism service providers should deliver services in a fairer way and tourist SWB should be attended to by both governments and academics.",

Patients (N = 240) referred to a specialized setting for the assessment and treatment of PDs completed the LPFS-BF, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1975), the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118; Verheul et al., 2008), and were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Personality Disorders (SCID-I; APA, 1994; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1997) and the SCID Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, Williams, & Benjamin, 1996). When constrained to a 2-factor oblique solution, the LPFS-BF yielded a structure that corresponded well to an interpretation of Self- and Interpersonal Functioning scales. The instrument demonstrated fair to satisfactory internal consistency and promising construct validity. The LPFS-BF constitutes a short, user-friendly instrument that provides a quick impression of the severity of personality pathology, specifically oriented to the DSM-5 model. Clearly, more research is needed to test its validity and clinical utility.",

      "abstract": "One of the major methods to identify microbial community composition, to unravel microbial population dynamics, and to explore microbial diversity in environmental samples is high-throughput DNA- or RNA-based 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing in combination with bioinformatics analyses. However, focusing on environmental samples from contrasting habitats, it was not systematically evaluated (i) which analysis methods provide results that reflect reality most accurately, (ii) how the interpretations of microbial community studies are biased by different analysis methods and (iii) if the most optimal analysis workflow can be implemented in an easy-to-use pipeline. Here, we compared the performance of 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing analysis tools (i.e., Mothur, QIIME1, QIIME2, and MEGAN) using three mock datasets with known microbial community composition that differed in sequencing quality, species number and abundance distribution (i.e., even or uneven), and phylogenetic diversity (i.e., closely related or well-separated amplicon sequences). Our results showed that QIIME2 outcompeted all other investigated tools in sequence recovery (>10 times fewer false positives), taxonomic assignments (>22% better F-score) and diversity estimates (>5% better assessment), suggesting that this approach is able to reflect the <i>in situ</i> microbial community most accurately. Further analysis of 24 environmental datasets obtained from four contrasting terrestrial and freshwater sites revealed dramatic differences in the resulting microbial community composition for all pipelines at genus level. For instance, at the investigated river water sites <i>Sphaerotilus</i> was only reported when using QIIME1 (8% abundance) and <i>Agitococcus</i> with QIIME1 or QIIME2 (2 or 3% abundance, respectively), but both genera remained undetected when analyzed with Mothur or MEGAN. Since these abundant taxa probably have implications for important biogeochemical cycles (e.g., nitrate and sulfate reduction) at these sites, their detection and semi-quantitative enumeration is crucial for valid interpretations. A high-performance computing conformant workflow was constructed to allow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable) 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequence analysis starting from raw sequence files, using the most optimal methods identified in our study. Our presented workflow should be considered for future studies, thereby facilitating the analysis of high-throughput 16S rRNA (gene) sequencing data substantially, while maximizing reliability and confidence in microbial community data analysis.",

This is true for both nonrandomized studies and randomized trials, which are the main study designs of systematic reviews. The Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS) was developed in 2013 and has gained wide usage as a risk-of-bias assessment tool for nonrandomized studies. Four risk-of-bias assessment experts revised it by reviewing existing assessment tools and user surveys. The main modifications included additional domains of selection and detection bias susceptible to nonrandomized studies of interventions, a more detailed consideration of the comparability of participants, and more reliable and valid outcome measurements. A psychometric assessment of the revised RoBANS (RoBANS 2) revealed acceptable inter-rater reliability (weighted kappa, 0.25 to 0.49) and construct validity in which intervention effects of studies with an unclear or high risk of bias were overestimated. The RoBANS 2 has acceptable feasibility, fair-to-moderate reliability, and construct validity. It provides a comprehensive framework for allowing authors to assess and understand the plausible risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions.",

This study aimed to examine the content and construct/convergent validity of five models from different regions: Australia/New Zealand (FSANZ), France (Nutri-Score), Canada (HCST), Europe (EURO) and Americas (PAHO). Using data from the 2013 UofT Food Label Information Program ( n 15342 foods/beverages), construct/convergent validity was assessed by comparing the classifications of foods determined by each model to a previously validated model, which served as the reference (Ofcom). The parameters assessed included associations (Cochran\u2013Armitage trend test), agreement ( \u03ba statistic) and discordant classifications (McNemar\u2019s test). Analyses were conducted across all foods and by food category. On the basis of the nutrients/components considered by each model, all models exhibited moderate content validity. Although positive associations were observed between each model and Ofcom (all P trend &lt;0\u00b7001), agreement with Ofcom was \u2018near perfect\u2019 for FSANZ ( \u03ba =0\u00b789) and Nutri-Score ( \u03ba =0\u00b783), \u2018moderate\u2019 for EURO ( \u03ba =0\u00b754) and \u2018fair\u2019 for PAHO ( \u03ba =0\u00b728) and HCST ( \u03ba =0\u00b726). There were discordant classifications with Ofcom for 5\u00b73 % (FSANZ), 8\u00b73 % (Nutri-Score), 22\u00b70 % (EURO), 33\u00b74 % (PAHO) and 37\u00b70 % (HCST) of foods (all P &lt;0\u00b7001). Construct/convergent validity was confirmed between FSANZ and Nutri-Score v. Ofcom, and to a lesser extent between EURO v. Ofcom. Numerous incongruencies with Ofcom were identified for HCST and PAHO, which highlights the importance of examining classifications across food categories, the level at which differences between models become apparent. These results may be informative for regulators seeking to adapt and validate existing models for use in country-specific applications.",

      "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the construct validity of the Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) test in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to identify characteristics related to an abnormal TUG time and to examine the responsiveness of the TUG to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). TUG time was assessed before and after comprehensive PR in 500 COPD patients, and compared cross-sectionally in 100 non-COPD subjects. Physical health outcomes, mental health outcomes, symptom-related outcomes and multidimensional indices were assessed in COPD patients only. Good convergent and discriminant validity was demonstrated by fair-to-moderate correlation with physical health outcomes, symptom-related outcomes and multidimensional indices ( r s = 0.18\u20130.70) and by little correlation with mental health outcomes ( r s = 0.21\u20130.26). COPD patients had a worse TUG time than non-COPD subjects, demonstrating known-groups validity. A TUG time of 11.2 seconds had good sensitivity (0.75) and specificity (0.83) for identifying patients with a baseline 6-minute walk distance &lt;350 m. TUG time improved after PR ( p &lt; 0.0001) and a change of 0.9\u20131.4 seconds was identified as clinically important. The TUG is valid and responsive in COPD. An abnormal result is indicative of poor health outcomes. This simple test provides valuable information and can be adopted in clinical and research settings.",

Humility involves (a) an Accurate View of Self and (b) the ability to regulate egotism and cultivate an other-oriented stance; IH is a subdomain of humility that involves (a) having an accurate view of one's intellectual strengths and limitations and (b) the ability to negotiate ideas in a fair and inoffensive manner. First, we present a theoretical framework for distinguishing these constructs. In Study 1, with a sample of undergraduate students (N = 1097), we used confirmatory factor analysis to provide empirical evidence for this distinction. We also found that IH predicted unique variance in openness to experience relative to GH. In Study 2, we examined additional evidence of discriminant validity with another sample of college students (N = 355). IH also predicted unique variance in need for cognition, objectivism, and religious ethnocentrism relative to GH.",

It is imperative for organizations to understand, how employees perceive the effectiveness of their PMS, for positive employee outcomes. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the operationalization of the construct \u201cemployee perception of PMS effectiveness\u201d (PMSE). An evidence of construct validity for the \u201ctwo-factor PMS effectiveness\u201d measure with perceived \u201cPMS accuracy\u201d and \u201cPMS fairness\u201d as its two factors is provided. In addition, a scale to measure \u201cemployee perception of PMS accuracy\u201d is developed. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Mixed-methods research methodology. Findings \u2013 Findings confirmed the possible existence of the two-factor PMSE construct, with PMS accuracy and fairness as its factors. Construct validity is established through its correlations with important outcome variables. The development of a valid and reliable 12-item scale for perceived PMS accuracy (Cronbach \u03b1 value=0.83) is an additional key contribution. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The research presents opportunities for future empirical studies to examine the influence of PMS accuracy and effectiveness on employee outcomes (engagement, retention, etc.). Researchers may also cross-validate the PMSE measure in different socio-cultural contexts. Practical implications \u2013 The perceived PMS accuracy and effectiveness measures can serve as powerful investigative tools to measure employee perceptions regarding PMS. It can help organizations identify and correct the shortcomings in their existing PMS. Originality/value \u2013 This is the first paper to offer a cogent conceptualization and operationalization of employee perceptions of PMS accuracy and effectiveness. Hence, it has key implications for academics and practitioners.",

To provide further evidence for construct validity of the German BRS and to determine population-based norms, a large sample (N = 1,128) representative of the German adult population completed a survey including the BRS and instruments measuring perceived stress and the resilience factors optimism, self-efficacy, and locus of control. Confirmatory factor analyses showed best model fit for a five-factor model differentiating the ability to recover from stress from the three resilience factors. On the basis of latent and manifest correlations, convergent and discriminant validity of the BRS were fair to good. Female sex, older age, lower weekly working time, higher perceived stress, lower optimism, and self-efficacy as well as higher external locus of control predicted lower BRS scores, that is, lower ability to recover from stress.",

      "abstract": "Race and class are deeply embedded in the way the field and teachers think about linguistic and written performance. Yet, addressing and understanding racial and linguistic prejudice remains important to the fairness of one\u2019s pedagogies, assessment practices, and curricular development. The author argues that social justice approaches to assessment require instructors and program administrators to rethink assessment concepts such as reliability and validity with an eye toward the ways disadvantage is embedded in the very construct task responses and assessment materials used to define quality writing. Because historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) present a unique blend of culturally relevant teaching and traditional (i.e., White) definitions of quality writing, they provide a unique site for inquiry into questions of writing assessment and social justice. Specifically, in engaging with the push-pull legacy toward language use and race that is found at HBCUs, the author indicates ways we might enable teachers, administrators, and students to resist monolingual, racialized consequences embedded in their views of writing assessment and rethink the foundational measurement concepts of reliability, validity, and fairness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Achalasia is a disease of mechanical esophageal dysfunction characterized by dysphagia, chest pain, regurgitation, and malnutrition. The Eckardt symptom score ( ESS ) is the gold standard self\u2010report assessment tool. Current guidelines outline a three\u2010step approach to patient reported outcomes measure design. Developed prior to these policies, the ESS has not undergone rigorous testing of its reliability and validity. Methods Adult achalasia patients retrospectively identified via a patient registry were grouped based on treatment history. Patients were grouped PREPOST (completed ESS , GERDQ , brief esophageal dysphagia questionnaire, NIH PROMIS Global Health, high resolution manometry, timed barium esophagram prior to treatment and after) and POST (completed measures only after treatment). Clinical characteristics, treatment type and date were obtained via medical record. Standardized psychometric analyses for reliability and construct validity were performed. Key Results 107 patients identified; 83 POST and 24 PREPOST . The ESS has fair internal consistency and split\u2010half reliability with a single factor structure. Dysphagia accounts for half the variance in ESS , while chest pain and weight loss account for 10% each. Pre\u2010post\u2010surgical assessment demonstrates improvements in ESS , except for weight loss. Effect sizes range from 0.24 to 2.53, with greatest change in regurgitation. Validity of the ESS is supported by modest correlations with GERDQ , HRQOL , and physiological data. Conclusions &amp; Inferences The ESS demonstrates fair reliability and validity, with a single factor structure mostly explained by dysphagia. Based on psychometric findings, weight loss and chest pain items may be decreasing ESS reliability and validity. Further assessment of the ESS under FDA guidelines is warranted.",

Thus, this study developed a scale to measure price fairness in line with the procedures recommended by the literature, and tested if the proposed items and dimensionality of the construct best fit the empirical data. Consequently, it was found that price fairness embraces two dimensions of cognitive and affective fairness. The valid and reliable measurement of price fairness may have far reaching theoretical and managerial implications.",

      "abstract": "Aims. Stigma of mental illness is a significant barrier to receiving mental health care. However, measurement tools evaluating stigma of mental illness have not been systematically assessed for their quality. We conducted a systematic review to critically appraise the methodological quality of studies assessing psychometrics of stigma measurement tools and determined the level of evidence of overall quality of psychometric properties of included tools. Methods. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and ERIC databases for eligible studies. We conducted risk-of-bias analysis with the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist, rating studies as excellent, good, fair or poor. We further rated the level of evidence of the overall quality of psychometric properties, combining the study quality and quality of each psychometric property, as: strong, moderate, limited, conflicting or unknown. Results. We identified 117 studies evaluating psychometric properties of 101 tools. The quality of specific studies varied, with ratings of: excellent ( n = 5); good (mostly on internal consistency ( n = 67)); fair (mostly on structural validity, n = 89 and construct validity, n = 85); and poor (mostly on internal consistency, n = 36). The overall quality of psychometric properties also varied from: strong (mostly content validity, n = 3), moderate (mostly internal consistency, n = 55), limited (mostly structural validity, n = 55 and construct validity, n = 46), conflicting (mostly test\u2013retest reliability, n = 9) and unknown (mostly internal consistency, n = 36). Conclusions. We identified 12 tools demonstrating limited evidence or above for (+, ++, +++) all their properties, 69 tools reaching these levels of evidence for some of their properties, and 20 tools that did not meet the minimum level of evidence for all of their properties. We note that further research on stigma tool development is needed to ensure appropriate application.",

      "abstract": "abstract: Using confirmatory factor analyses and multiple indicators per construct, we examined a number of theoretically derived factor structures pertaining to numerous trust-relevant constructs (from 9 to12) across four institutional contexts (police, local governance, natural resources, state governance) and multiple participant-types (college students via an online survey, community residents as part of a city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget engagement activity, a random sample of rural landowners, and a national sample of adult Americans via an Amazon Mechanical Turk study). Across studies, a number of common findings emerged. First, the best fitting models in each study maintained separate factors for each trust-relevant construct. Furthermore, post hoc analyses involving addition of higher-order factors tended to fit better than collapsing of factors. Second, dispositional trust was easily distinguishable from the other trust-related constructs, and positive and negative constructs were often distinguishable. However, the items reflecting positive trust attitude constructs or positive trustworthiness perceptions showed low discriminant validity. Differences in findings between studies raise questions warranting further investigation in future research, including differences in correlations among latent constructs varying from very high (e.g., 12 inter-factor correlations above .9 in Study 2) to more moderate (e.g., only 3 correlations above .8 in Study 4). Further, the results from one study (Study 4) suggested that legitimacy, fairness, and voice were especially highly correlated and may form a single higher-order factor, but the other studies did not. Future research is needed to determine when and why different higher-order factor structures may emerge in different institutional contexts or with different samples.",

Cronbach's alpha is regularly adopted in studies in science education: it was referred to in 69 different papers published in 4 leading science education journals in a single year (2015)\u2014usually as a measure of reliability. This article explores how this statistic is used in reporting science education research and what it represents. Authors often cite alpha values with little commentary to explain why they feel this statistic is relevant and seldom interpret the result for readers beyond citing an arbitrary threshold for an acceptable value. Those authors who do offer readers qualitative descriptors interpreting alpha values adopt a diverse and seemingly arbitrary terminology. More seriously, illustrative examples from the science education literature demonstrate that alpha may be acceptable even when there are recognised problems with the scales concerned. Alpha is also sometimes inappropriately used to claim an instrument is unidimensional. It is argued that a high value of alpha offers limited evidence of the reliability of a research instrument, and that indeed a very high value may actually be undesirable when developing a test of scientific knowledge or understanding. Guidance is offered to authors reporting, and readers evaluating, studies that present Cronbach's alpha statistic as evidence of instrument quality.",

Cross-sectional data from (1) a random sample of employees in Sweden aged 25\u201365 years (n = 2847) and (2) a convenience sample of non-managerial employees from 94 workplaces (n = 3066) were analyzed. Benchmarks for three PSC risk levels were developed using organizational compliance with Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) regulations as criterion. The results support the validity and usefulness of the Swedish PSC-4 as an instrument to indicate good, fair, and poor OSH practices. The recommended benchmark for indicating good OSH practices is an average score of &gt;12.0, while the proposed cutoff for poor OSH practices is a score of \u22648.0 on the PSC-4. Scores between these benchmarks indicate fair OSH practices. Furthermore, aggregated data on PSC-4 supported its reliability as a workplace level construct and its association with quantitative demands, quality of leadership, commitment to the workplace, work engagement, job satisfaction, as well as stress and burnout. Thus, the Swedish version of PSC-4 can be regarded as a valid and reliable measure for both research and practical use for risk assessment at workplaces.",

While both appear to serve a prosocial function, they may represent separate mechanisms corresponding with distinct emotional and psychological antecedents, and thus may be predicted by different personality traits. In this study, we compared adherence to fairness norms in the dictator game with responses to violations of the same norms in third-party punishment and recompensation games with respect to prosocial traits from the Big Five and HEXACO models of personality. The results revealed a pattern of differential relations between prosocial traits and game behaviours. While norm adherence in the dictator game was driven by traits reflecting good manners and non-aggression (the politeness aspect of Big Five agreeableness and HEXACO honesty-humility), third-party recompensation of victims\u2014and to a lesser extent, punishment of offenders\u2014was uniquely driven by traits reflecting emotional concern for others (the compassion aspect of Big Five agreeableness). These findings demonstrate the discriminant validity between similar prosocial constructs and highlight the different prosocial motivations underlying economic game behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aims Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) provides a crowdsourcing platform for the engagement of potential research participants with data collection instruments. This review (1) provides an introduction to the mechanics and validity of MTurk research; (2) gives examples of MTurk research; and (3) discusses current limitations and best practices in MTurk research. Methods We review four use cases of MTurk for research relevant to addictions: (1) the development of novel measures, (2) testing interventions, (3) the collection of longitudinal use data to determine the feasibility of longer\u2010term studies of substance use and (4) the completion of large batteries of assessments to characterize the relationships between measured constructs. We review concerns with the platform, ways of mitigating these and important information to include when presenting findings. Results MTurk has proved to be a useful source of data for behavioral science more broadly, with specific applications to addiction science. However, it is still not appropriate for all use cases, such as population\u2010level inference. To live up to the potential of highly transparent, reproducible science from MTurk, researchers should clearly report inclusion/exclusion criteria, data quality checks and reasons for excluding collected data, how and when data were collected and both targeted and actual participant compensation. Conclusions Although on\u2010line survey research is not a substitute for random sampling or clinical recruitment, the Mechanical Turk community of both participants and researchers has developed multiple tools to promote data quality, fairness and rigor. Overall, Mechanical Turk has provided a useful source of convenience samples despite its limitations and has demonstrated utility in the engagement of relevant groups for addiction science.",

Methods We utilized data from the Norwegian nationwide Survey of Living Conditions on work environment in 2006 and 2009. We classified occupations on a 4-digit level based on the Norwegian version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88). The mechanical and psychosocial exposure information was collected by personal telephone interviews and included exposures that were known risk factors for low-back pain. We evaluated the agreement between the individual- and JEM-based exposure estimates, with kappa, sensitivity and specificity measures. We assessed the JEM`s predictive validity by testing the associations between low-back pain and the individual- and JEM-based exposure. Results The results showed an overall fair-to-moderate agreement between the constructed JEM and individual work exposures. The JEM performed considerably better for mechanical work exposures compared with psychosocial work exposures. The predictive validity of the mechanical and psychosocial JEM showed a consistently lower but predominantly reproducible association with low-back pain for both genders. Conclusions The mechanical estimates and psychosocial stressors, such as psychological demands, monotonous work and decision latitude in the constructed JEM, may be useful in large epidemiological register studies. The predictive validity of the matrix was evaluated as being overall acceptable, it can thus be an effective and versatile approach to estimate the relationship between work exposures and low-back pain.",

      "abstract": "Objectified body consciousness (OBC) appears to play a crucial role in eating and body-related disturbances, which typically emerge during adolescence. The 24-item OBC Scale (OBCS) has been employed in eating disorder (ED) research and school-based adolescent samples, but evidence for its psychometric proprieties exists only in adult (nonclinical) populations. We evaluated (a) the construct validity and reliability of the 24-item OBCS with data collected from 1,259 adolescent girls and boys from the community (Study 1) and 643 adolescents of both genders with an ED (Study 2) and (b) whether the instrument functions similarly and equivalently measures the underlying construct(s) across gender and samples (i.e., test of measurement equivalence/invariance; Study 3). Results upheld the three-factor structure and measurement equivalence/invariance of the 24-item OBCS across gender and samples. OBCS subscale scores were internally consistent and stable over a 4-week period. OBCS subscales discriminated community participants with high and low ED symptom levels with fair accuracy, as well as community participants from those with an ED. They were also associated with five constructs closely related to both OBC and ED psychopathology. Latent mean comparisons across samples and gender were performed and discussed. Implications and directions for future research are also outlined.",

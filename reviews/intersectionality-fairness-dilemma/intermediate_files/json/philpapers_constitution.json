      "snippet": "Inspired by Heidegger\u2019s concept of the clearing of being, and by Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas on human practice, Theodore Schatzki offers a novel approach to understanding the constitution and transformation of social life. Key to the account he develops here is the context in which social life unfolds\u2014the &quot;site of the social&quot;\u2014as a contingent and constantly metamorphosing mesh of practices and material orders.",

In conclusion, I suggest that constitutional sociology might significantly help elucidating the potential losses and heteronomous tendencies that may result from the contemporary uncertainty and possible metamorphosis that affects the modern constitution.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mattering is an ideal state of affairs consisting of two complementary psychological experiences: feeling valued and adding value. Human beings can feel valued by, and add value to, self, others, work, and community. To make sure that the need for mattering is fulfilled, we must balance feeling valued with adding value. Moreover, we must balance adding value to self with adding value to others. Unfortunately, the dominant neoliberal philosophy does not support the values required to ensure the experience of mattering. Whereas a healthy and fair society would require equilibrium among values for personal, relational, and collective well\u2010being, the dominant philosophy in many parts of the world favors personal at the expense of relational and collective values. Neoliberal economic and social policies have resulted in diminished sense of mattering for millions of people. Some people respond to cultural pressures to achieve higher status by becoming depressive or aggressive. Some marginalized groups, in turn, support xenophobic, nationalistic, and populist policies in an effort to regain a sense of mattering. To make sure that everyone matters, we must align the psychology, philosophy, and politics of mattering. The political struggle for a just and equitable distribution of mattering takes place in social movements and the policy arena. The perils and promises of these efforts are considered.",

It examines the Oromo Gada system\u2019s democratic governance and leadership principles and argues its relevance to the current and future leadership effectiveness in Oromia, Ethiopia, and Africa. It analyses the literature on the history, culture, and current practices of the Gada system to identify its leadership philosophies. It discusses these principles by comparing with Ubuntu and other indigenous African leadership philosophies on the one hand with UN principles of good governance on the other. Evidences show that in spite of the expansion of modern education and leadership training; there are little or no evidence of leadership effectiveness in Africa. Corruption, poverty, injustice, and lack of legitimacy and accountability have continued to be the images of Africa and its leadership. These leadership failures are attributed to lack of leadership that connects with the societal values and cultures. The adoption of Gada leadership principles of liberty, equality, morality, rule of law, participation and engagement of citizens, decision making by consensus, separation of power and check and balance, decentralized governance, fixed terms office and peaceful transfer of power, accountability, transparency and impeachment of elected leaders, honesty, team leadership and conflict transformation in political, public and private sector organization leadership are discussed. The development and adoption of Gada, Ubuntu, and other indigenous leadership philosophies is recommended as a remedy to Africa\u2019s leadership problems.",

Heidegger\u2019s idiosyncratic and deeply philosophical account of volkism stood at the heart of his political support of National Socialism and of his exclusion of the Jews from the ontological task of thinking. This article demonstrates, however, that some of Heidegger\u2019s Jewish readers identified with volkish moments in his philosophy and found these to be pertinent to their own condition as Jews in the modern world. This was made possible by the fact that, within the intellectual climate in which Heidegger\u2019s thinking took shape, the volkish lexicon (Volk, Gemeinschaft, \u2018fate\u2019, \u2018destiny\u2019, and even \u2018struggle\u2019) was commonplace, indicated no clear association with any certain political view, and, indeed, was a central organ through which Jews made sense of their own existence and historical and political situation. Thus, while Heidegger\u2019s volkism led to a philosophical marginalization of Jews, the multifariousness and widespread currency of volkish thinking brought some Jewish readers to recognize their shared conceptual horizon with Heidegger and to differentiate between Heidegger\u2019s practical politics, which were anti-Jewish and loathsome, and his volkism, which was seen as fitting and useful for the Jewish case.",

The central tenets of Freire's thought as reflectively (and reflexively) acting upon the world to transform it, are as current today as these were in the late 1960s, majorly because of the subjectively active ways it interacts with our onto-epistemological locations and intentions. It is in appreciating such durable temporality about his philosophy that one can sense, indeed, thickly discern it trans-spatial and transcultural connections with the humanist African philosophy of Ubuntu and it educational foundations. Ubuntu in its across-Africa readings, represents both a practical and aspirational humanization of all people (more popularly, perceiving and practicing our personhoods through the personhoods of others) with the potential outcome, in the words of Desmond Tutu (in Battle, 2009), of the cessation of inter-people conflict and oppression. With these perspectives and prospects from Freire and Ubuntu, the intersecting subsets of the two are, I argue, thickly important with analytically discernible onto-epistemological and pedagogical connections and operations.",

Their proposal intersects with key debates in philosophy of psychiatry, including how best to define mental disorders, to validate them, and to optimize their meta-structure. Review of these debates in the context of behavioral addictions suggests several conclusions. First, these debates involve \u201cessentially contested\u201d constructs that require ongoing consideration and judgment. Second, the complexity of psychopathology suggests multiple legitimate approaches to delineating traits and explicating mechanisms. Third, in optimizing meta-structure, non-psychobiological considerations are crucial - the overlapping public mental health approach to addictive disorders is paramount.",

On the one hand, it aims to argue that the continued use of scientific explanation as a meta-concept should be constantly held accountable to the epistemological or metaphysical commitments that necessarily come with it. One cannot legitimate the use of scientific explanation by referring to the supposed, simple fact that science explains the world. On the other hand, it aims to proliferate the consciousness that the concepts with which philosophers reason about science always have a historical, contingent point of emergence. Consequently, philosophers who aim to be responsible for their own forms of thinking and the concepts that operate in it, should also profess a critical, historicizing attitude towards these forms of thinking.",

The term \u201crace-religion constellation\u201d refers to the connection or co-constitution of the categories of race and \u201creligion.\u201d Specifically, the term \u201crace-religion constellation\u201d is used to refer to the practice of classifying people into races according to categories we now associate with the term \u201creligion.\u201d This calls for a consideration of European history and forms of racism in Europe, such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. This article aims to provide an alternative non-secularized or biological account of the origins of the socially constructed category of race in Europe. The alternative story begins in the sixteenth century, when the category of \u201creligion\u201d as a means for classifying peoples was both constructed and politicized. In tracing this alternative story, this article seeks to outline a framework for a critical philosophy of race focused on a European religion line that intersects with Du Bois's color line.",

      "abstract": "This book develops an intersectional feminist approach to moral responsibility. It accomplisheses four main goals. First, it outlines a concise list of the main principles of intersectional feminism. Second, it uses these principles to critique prevailing philosophical theories of moral responsibility. Third, it offers an account of moral responsibility that is compatible with the ethos of intersectional feminism. And fourth, it uses intersectional feminist principles to critique culturally normative responsibility practices. This is the first book to provide an explicitly intersectional feminist approach to moral responsibility. After identifying the five principles central to intersectional feminism, the author demonstrates how influential theories of responsibility are incompatible with these principles. She argues that a normatively adequate theory of blame should not be preoccupied with the agency or traits of wrongdoers; it should instead underscore, and seek to ameliorate, oppression and adversity as experienced by the marginalized. Apt blame and praise, according to her intersectional feminist account, is both communicative and functionalist. The book concludes with an extensive discussion of culturally embedded responsibility practices, including asymmetrically structured conversations and gender- and racially biased social spaces. An Intersectional Feminist Approach to Moral Responsibility presents a sophisticated and original philosophical account of moral responsibility. It will be of interest to philosophers working at the crossroads of moral responsibility, feminist philosophy, critical race theory, queer theory, critical disability studies, and intersectionality theory.",

This paper encapsulates a comprehensive review that delves into the ethical and sustainable dimensions of business analytics, probing the philosophical underpinnings that shape the responsible use of data in corporate decision-making. The review examines the moral considerations inherent in business analytics, investigating the ethical implications of data collection, analysis, and utilization. It contemplates the evolving landscape of data privacy, transparency, and the ethical responsibilities of businesses in the era of pervasive data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, the paper explores sustainability in business analytics, acknowledging the environmental impact of data centers, energy consumption, and the life cycle of digital technologies. It evaluates the philosophical principles guiding sustainable practices in the field, aiming to harmonize the pursuit of data-driven insights with ecological responsibility. In essence, this study outlines a comprehensive exploration of how philosophy shapes and guides sustainable and ethical approaches in the domain of business analytics. It sets the stage for a critical examination of the evolving intersection between data-driven decision-making and the ethical principles that underpin responsible corporate practices.&#x0D; Keywords: Philosophy, Business Analytics, Sustainable, Ethical Approaches, Review.",

      "abstract": "It has been charged that transformative learning theory is stagnating; however, theoretical insights from relational ontologies offer significant possibilities for revitalizing the field. Quantum physics has led to a deep revision in our understanding of the universe moving away from the materialism and mechanism of classical physics. Some scientists observe that this shifting view of reality is catalyzing a profound cultural transformation. They have also noted significant intersections between the New Science and North American Indigenous philosophies as well as Eastern mysticism, all relational ontologies. These intersections as well as the theory of agential realism of Karen Barad, feminist physicist, are used to propose a next generation of transformative learning theory, one that is embedded in ontologies of relationality. The author came to relational ontology through environmental and sustainability education. This fruitful cross-fertilization helps illuminate a transformative approach to sustainability education or transformative sustainability education\u2014which has not yet been explicitly theorized. Relationality demands an ethical, ontological, and epistemological transformation. The six criteria that emerge in the overlap between quantum physics, living systems theory from ecology, and Indigenous philosophies can reframe our understandings of transformative education, particularly toward socially just and regenerative cultures, completing the work of unfinished justice and climate movements. Pertinent to adult educators, Naomi Klein (2014) asks, \u201cHistory knocked on your door, did you answer?\u201d (p. 466).",

      "abstract": "Universities, globally, and in South Africa, continue to be confronted with demands for transformation, humanisation of pedagogical practices and to embrace social justice. Aim: In this article, we bring to the surface possibilities of Ubuntu pedagogy within a social justice framework. We intersect Collective Fingers Theory and Social Justice Theory to propose the notion of Ubuntu pedagogy, which draws from African philosophy of Ubuntu. We argue that Ubuntu pedagogy provides an alternation to the current pedagogies that draw from European theories for teaching and learning in the South African higher education context. We put forward that, Ubuntu pedagogy, when embraced with understanding and dignity it deserves, has the potential, firstly, of initiating students from other cultures other than African cultures to the values of Ubuntu and, secondly, of reconnecting students with their values and cultures, but it has a capacity to cultivate social justice values of equity, recognition and fair participation amongst students from diverse social backgrounds. Setting: South African Higher Education. Methodology: The authors draw from literature to position the article within Ubuntu philosophical framework and social justice lenses. Themes emerging from literature are as follows: Intersection of Ubuntu philosophy and social justice, Ubuntu pedagogy and transformation in higher education and guiding principles for possible implementation of Ubuntu pedagogy. Results: At the intersection of Ubuntu pedagogy and social justice, classroom practices are designed to respond to students\u2019 cultural competencies and to embrace all linguistic repertoires that students bring to the classroom for learning. Students are treated equally and with dignity and respect regardless of their social backgrounds. Conclusion: We argue that higher education classrooms in post-apartheid South Africa should enable equal access, equity and inclusivity for all students. We therefore recommend Ubuntu pedagogy as a culturally and socially just pedagogy for transformative higher education classrooms. This article contributes to the continuing dialogues about transformative pedagogies, decolonisation and social justice in South African higher education.",

Porter brings this history to bear on an omnipresent feature of Romantic-era literature, its mixtures of verse and prose. Combining analyses of printed books and manuscripts with recent scholarship in the history of science, she elucidates the compositional practices and formal dilemmas of Erasmus Darwin, Robert Southey, Charlotte Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In doing so she re-examines the relationship between Romantic literature and eighteenth-century empiricist science, philosophy, and forms of art and explores how Romantic writers engaged with the ideas of Enlightenment empiricism in their work.",

And, perhaps most importantly, what is that \u2018Future\u2019? These debates have been located in the work of diverse scholars: from the West, from Global South, from indigenous thinkers. In this collective piece, we purposefully juxtapose (and do not categorise under forced headings) diverse takes on the future of these intersections. We have given up the urge to organise, place together, separate with subheadings or connect the paragraphs that follow. Instead, we let these philosophers of education and thinkers who use philosophical texts and ideas to sit together in one long read as potentially \u2018strange and unusual bedfellows\u2019. This text urges us to understand how these scholars and thinkers perceive our educational philosophical futures, and how the work and thinking they have done on thinking about what the future of that new key in philosophy of education may look like is embedded in a much deeper and richer literature, and personal experience.",

With Hate Speech Law: A Philosophical Examination he justly claims to have explored \u201cnumerous principled arguments for and against hate speech law by articulating a collection of key normative principles\u201d (316). This ambitious book identifies and organizes conflicting values within the hate speech controversies. It aims to synthesize deeper questions about core concepts of liberalism, democracy, personhood, dignity, and tolerance with policy concerns about pragmatics and effectiveness. The most seasoned free speech scholars will find points and angles they had not previously considered.",

      "abstract": "Agential realism\u2014the idea that it makes sense to view the world as being composed of various forms of protean nonhuman agency\u2014has been a topic of discussion for many social science scholars in recent years. This increase of interest in agent ontologies can be attributed to the new feminist materialist movement in the philosophy of science literature. However, agent ontologies also are found in Indigenous studies literature and in Peircean pragmatism. These latter sources are also a part of the current methodological conversation about nonhuman agency. This article explores the connections between agential realist philosophy and social science research that employs narrative forms of analysis and representation. The goal is to assist narrative researchers in avoiding oversimplification by tracing out different strands in these literatures and mapping out points of connection and disconnection in detail. Intersections that hold the promise of complementary development are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "In bringing together a global community of philosophers, Global Epistemologies and Philosophies of Science develops novel perspectives on epistemology and philosophy of science by demonstrating how frameworks from academic philosophy (e.g. standpoint theory, social epistemology, feminist philosophy of science) and related fields (e.g. decolonial studies, transdisciplinarity, global history of science) can contribute to critical engagement with global dimensions of knowledge and science. Global challenges such as climate change, food production, and infectious diseases raise complex questions about scientific knowledge production and its interactions with local knowledge systems and social realities. As academic philosophy provides relatively little reflection on global negotiations of knowledge, many pressing scientific and societal issues remain disconnected from core debates in epistemology and philosophy of science. This book is an invitation to broaden agendas of academic philosophy by presenting epistemology and philosophy of science as globally engaged fields that address heterogeneous forms of knowledge production and their interactions with local livelihoods, practices, and worldviews. This integrative ambition makes the book equally relevant for philosophers and interdisciplinary scholars who are concerned with methodological and political challenges at the intersection of science and society.",

      "abstract": "Among the most notable features of contemporary moral philosophy is the emergence of topics like race, gender, and disability from relative obscurity into the philosophical mainstream. Where only a century ago these topics saw virtually no traffic, they now attract heated debate. Simultaneously, we have witnessed the rise (or return) of several novel approaches to normative ethics. One of the more prominent of these has been feminist care ethics, which is now commonly regarded as a defensible alternative to ethics like utilitarianism and deontology. The relative novelty of both the philosophy of disability and care ethics makes for a vast stretch of terra nova at their intersection. Eva Kittay's Learning From My Daughter is a sophisticated, earnest exploration of this new philosophical territory. Written from both a philosopher's perspective and that of a mother caring for a child with significant cognitive disabilities, it is the first in a duo of books explicating Kittay's journey with Sesha and its impact on her philosophical views. Learning From My Daughter focuses primarily on normative and applied ethics, and it lays the foundation for a future monograph on justice and personhood.",

We argue that imaginaries provide ways of organizing that combine ideas and concrete practices, imagining organizational alternatives by enacting new forms of collective practice. Permaculture movements, because of their combination of local, situated design practices and underlying social and political philosophies, provide an interesting case of imaginaries that make it possible to reimagine the relations between humans, non-human species and the natural environment. We identify and describe three imaginaries found in permaculture movements, conceiving of permaculture, respectively, as a technical design practice, a holistic life philosophy, and an intersectional social movement. These imaginaries open up possibilities for political and social alternatives to industrially organized agriculture, but are also at risk of various forms of ideological co-optation based on their underlying social premises. We discuss our perspective in terms of developing the concept of imaginaries in relation to organizational scholarship, particularly in contexts where fundamental relations between humans and the natural environment must be reimagined, as in the case of environmentalist organizing in response to the Anthropocene.",

To account for this, we must deny the opposition of affect and intentionality often assumed in the philosophy of emotion and the affective turn: while affect and intentionality are not opposed in principle, affective intentionality may be refused uptake in oppressive practices. In section 1, I read Merleau\u2010Ponty\u2019s theory of the body schema as a theory of affect that accommodates my account of affective injustice and aligns with accounts of affect transmission and circulation in feminist philosophies of the affective turn. This is crucial for understanding Fanon\u2019s contribution to the theory of the body schema, in which it is susceptible to historical\u2010racial \u201caffective disorders.\u201d In sections 2\u20134, I distinguish three types of affective injustice: affective marginalization, exploitation, and violence. In section 2 I develop an intersectional feminist account of this distinction drawing on Lorde and Lugones and raise questions about the limits of framing the issue of affective injustice in terms of intentionality as opposed to a more psychoanalytic conceptual vocabulary that accommodates the displacement of affective force. In sections 3 and 4, I explore these affective injustices through an analysis of Fanonian concepts, showing how the theory of the body schema can accommodate not only affective intentionality but also the oppressive disjunction of affect and intentionality, as well as forms of affective injustice that exceed the oppressive disabling of sense\u2010making and involve the exploitative and violent displacement of affective force.",

The book introduces readers to the most pressing issues facing the field, and gives a perspective that is representative of the range of views and concerns that reflect the current research terrain. The book addresses three main themes: the origins of moral disgust, exploring the evolutionary function of disgust and its role in sustaining group dynamics; the psychological mechanisms underlying disgust responses and the way in which disgust influences reasoning about agency, violence, sex, and meaning; and the ethical challenges posed by disgust. The contributors explore whether we are justified in using disgust to form beliefs about right and wrong and how disgust sheds light on the very nature of morality.</JATS1:p>",

The volume arises from a commitment to actively engage the ancient philosophical tradition as a powerful field through which to tackle some of the most urgent questions addressed by the new materialisms and forms of post- and non-humanism. The papers gathered here take up ancient Greek philosophical and literary texts as at once live with possibilities for the present and uncannily distant. Collectively, they approach antiquity as neither origin nor telos but as asynchronous or untimely in Nietzsche\u2019s sense. By bringing together a range of international scholars actively working at the intersections of ancient philosophy, literature, continental philosophy, feminist theory, and political theory, the volume opens up new vectors for thinking beyond the human that are informed by and responsive to the contemporary world while proposing a complex set of relationships to the <italic>longue dur\u00e9e</italic> of Western history, to deep time, and to the profound strangeness and unsettling familiarity of the Greco-Roman world. In this way, the volume resists and displaces the seductions of presentism, scientism, and technological determinism that often limit the horizons of new materialist thinking.",

Written by a philosopher and a geographer in a clear style, with a practical orientation and interdisciplinary focus, the Guide enables readers to grasp the basics of complexity theory (the study of self-organisation and emergence in material systems), while the Glossary eases the difficulty of applying this science to Deleuze and Guattari's often perplexing terminology. Deleuze and Geophilosophy is thoroughly pragmatic: it asks not what the earth means, but how it works. It provides a common conceptual framework within which physical and human geographers can work together alongside other social scientists, cultural studies practitioners, and philosophers in interdisciplinary teams to explore the entangled flows, lines, grids, and spaces of our world. The book will be of interest to all those working in disciplines at the intersections of culture, nature, space, and history: anthropology, art and architecture theory, communication studies, geography, Marxism and historical materialism, philosophy, postcolonial theory, urban studies, and many other disciplines. Key Features Explores a new aspect of Deleuzian thought - 'geophilosophy' (geography & philosophy) The first part of the book explains the basics of complexity theory Half of the book is a Glossary which helps readers with Deleuze and Guattari's perplexing terminology Emphasis on 'bodies politic' in geophilosophy and complexity theory which has never before been linked in such a way",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Oxford Handbook of AI Governance examines how artificial intelligence (AI) interacts with and influences governance systems. It also examines how governance systems influence and interact with AI. The handbook spans 49 chapters across nine major sections. These sections are (1) Introduction and Overview, (2) Value Foundations of AI Governance, (3) Developing an AI Governance Regulatory Ecosystem, (4) Frameworks and Approaches for AI Governance, (5) Assessment and Implementation of AI Governance, (6) AI Governance from the Ground Up, (7) Economic Dimensions of AI Governance, (8) Domestic Policy Applications of AI, and (9) International Politics and AI Governance. The chapters in this handbook come from a wide set of disciplines and areas of study, and from a wide variety of cultures and backgrounds. This is a growing field of study that is deeply intertwined with the fields of political science, computer science, economics, international politics, philosophy, mathematics, and ethics, among others. It takes its lessons from both academia and industry, and from think tanks and activists. The intersection of AI and governance presents vast challenges and opportunities for both our collective global civilization and our individual wellbeing. This handbook serves as a guide through the pathways of these challenges and opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores the underrepresentation of women and minorities in academic philosophy. Specifically, it focuses on why, given the relatively even male/female ratio at undergraduate level, women are underrepresented at every level above this. It addresses some of the misconceptions and myths surrounding women in philosophy, including those surrounding the discussion of the different\u2010intuition hypothesis. It also explores the ways in which feminist research in philosophy is subject to marginalisation as a result of systematic exclusionary practices typical of the dominant culture of justification within traditional philosophy. It argues for the necessity of an intersectional approach, and the importance of taking seriously the psychological and sociological analysis of underrepresentation, in order to improve both the experience and the representation of women and other minorities at all levels of professional philosophy, as well as of the discipline as a whole.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are. This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as \"knows\", \"believes\", and \"thinks\", when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.",

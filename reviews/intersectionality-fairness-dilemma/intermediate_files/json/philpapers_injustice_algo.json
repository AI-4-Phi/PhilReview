      "snippet": "As we detail in this paper, epistemic fragmentation is a structural characteristic of algorithmically-mediated environments that isolate individuals, making it more difficult to develop, uptake and apply new epistemic resources, thus making it more difficult to identify and conceptualise emerging harms in these environments. We thus trace the occurrence of hermeneutical injustice back to the fragmentation of the epistemic experiences of individuals, who are left more vulnerable by the inability to share, compare and learn from shared experiences.",

      "abstract": "In \u201cThe Construction of Human Kinds\u201d, Ron Mallon explores how social categories such as race, gender, and sexuality are not natural facts but are formed through collective beliefs, language, and social roles. He argues that although these categories are socially constructed, they can still be real, stable, and causally powerful. The book combines philosophy of science, cognitive psychology, and social theory to develop a realistic version of social constructionism. Mallon shows how treating categories as \u201cnatural\u201d can reduce moral responsibility and sustain inequality. He also explains how people often unknowingly perform social roles that they believe to be biologically grounded. This work is crucial for understanding how identity and structure are created and maintained. It offers theoretical tools to analyze social change and address injustice in contemporary societies.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the question of how human science categories yield projectable inferences by critically examining Ron Mallon\u2019s \u201csocial role\u201d account of human kinds. Mallon contends that human categories are projectable when a social role produces a homeostatic property cluster (HPC) kind. On this account, human categories are projectable when various social mechanisms stabilize and entrench those categories. Mallon\u2019s analysis obscures a distinction between transitory and robust projectable inferences. I argue that the social kinds discussed by Mallon yield the former, while classifications of biological kinds yield the latter. Classifications from psychiatry (\u201cschizophrenia,\u201d \u201chysteria\u201d) are discussed as examples.",

Many scholars claim that social constructionism about a kind is a version of realism about that kind, according to which the corresponding kind is a social construction, that it, it is constituted by social factors and practices. Social constructionism, then, is a version of realism about a kind that asserts that the kind is real, and puts forward a particular view about the nature of the kind, namely, that it is constituted by social factors and practices. Social constructivists about human kinds such as gender, race and sexual orientation often make an additional claim, namely, that these kinds are social constructions but they are typically believed to be biological kinds (that is, people are typically wrong about the nature of these kinds). Ron Mallon (2017) calls social constructions that are (falsely) taken to be biological kinds covert social constructions. This paper is about how we could have terms in our natural language that come to refer to covert social constructions.",

      "abstract": "The widespread introduction of digital information and communication tech\u00adnologies is changing the very nature of interpersonal and mass social interaction, creating new practices, meanings and forms of intersubjectivity. The article ana\u00adlyzes a number of approaches to the creation of general artificial intelligence (AGI) systems based on the convergence of methods of phenomenological ana\u00adlysis of intentional structures of intersubjectivity with technologies for creating and training artificial neural network systems of generative intelligence \u2013 Chat\u00adGPT. It is shown that one of the most promising areas of constructing the cogni\u00adtive architecture of AGI is the theory of frames as modeling schemes or matrices of stereotypical organization and interpretation of everyday experience. This conclusion is based on the fact that frames, as well as the procedures for swit\u00adching and configuring them, act as a kind of \u201cspiritual automata\u201d that control typical behavior of people in typical situations. The dual role of digital platforms in the social construction of reality is shown. On the one hand, digital platforms allow users to realize their aspirations and express the uniqueness of their indi\u00adviduality, facilitate access to information, etc. On the other hand, our digital alter Ego, generated by intelligent systems, acquires the ability to recursively target, direct and control our thinking, motivations, emotional reactions, etc. The direct digital access to our spiritual life is not an inevitable consequence of the intro\u00adduction of digital technologies into the world of everyday life, but a political project that can and should be sought for effective alternatives",

These properties, which are customarily identified as genuine grounds of discrimination, are also at the forefront of constructionist efforts to understand reality as a product of social interactions. Theories of discrimination have so far neglected the important question of how understanding the nature of these properties impacts our theoretical views of the kind of phenomenon discrimination is. This article outlines some pitfalls of assuming away complexities regarding the ontology of the underlying properties, and systematically develops a constructionist account of discrimination, which I call Discrimination without Traits. I argue pursuing a constructionist view of grounds reveals discrimination to be not a discrete process involving a discriminator and a victim, but an ongoing process of (re)negotiating social reality that is fundamentally political. This uncovers neglected avenues for designing political remedies to discrimination.",

      "abstract": "Real kinds, both natural and social categories, are characterized by rich inductive potential. They have relatively stable sets of conceptually independent projectable properties. Somewhat surprisingly, even some purely social categories (e.g., ethnicity, gender, political orientation) show such multiple projectability. The article explores the origin of the inductive richness of social categories and concepts. I argue that existing philosophical accounts provide only a partial explanation, and mechanisms of boundary formation and stabilization must be brought into view for a more comprehensive account of inductively rich social categories.",

      "abstract": "\n Truth and Social Reality: A Metaphysical Inquiry presents a new theory of social truth and social construction. The book weds truthmaker theory with recent work in social ontology, arguing that social truths are true in virtue of socially constructed portions of the world. It focuses on the construction of human social kinds like gender, race, class, and disability. The book offers novel accounts of social construction (one in terms of truthmaking), realism, social kind pluralism, social context, the context dependency of social truth, and social vagueness. Overall, Truth and Social Reality presents a realist picture of the social world in which there are objective truths about the way things are in the social world. Social truth is not socially constructed despite being grounded in a socially constructed reality. The theory it provides nonetheless captures the contingency, alterability, vagueness of the social world, and the context dependency of social truth. The book also addresses the relationships between truth, power, and justice. It argues that truth itself is not a tool of oppression, as some maintain. Rather, truth and truth-telling play an essential role in upending oppression and achieving justice. Truth and Social Reality aims to rebut the cynicism of the \u201cpost-truth\u201d age by defending the possibility and value of social truth.",

As a small contrast case to making organoids, I will use the regulation and categorization of embryonic research as a more \u201cnatural kind\u201d entity research compared to conceptually synthetic research, where the objects to be regulated are shaped by existing practices of language and material alike. While analyzing the conceptual making of the organoids, I will follow the general methodological framework of Ian Hacking in Social Construction of What? (1999) from philosophy of science, particularly his understanding of \u201clooping kinds\u201d. And since Hacking\u2019s understanding of looping kinds is in a relatively vague formulation, I will supply with different structures within co \u2013 productionist account of science and technology studies, most notably of works of Jasonoff (2015) of co-productionist accounts and Bensaude \u2013 Vincent\u2019s concept of \u201cbuzzword coalitions\u201d (2014) in the making of conceptual coalition around organoids. I will use the structure of scientific objects to assign different uses of parts of concepts in the making.",

This Element aims to provide an overview of this burgeoning field, and also to map the questions that theories in social ontology address. When we encounter a theory of some social thing \u2013 groups, law, gender, and so on \u2013how are we to read it? What classes of theories have been explored and abandoned, and what classes are new and promising? The Element distinguishes theories of social construction from theories that characterize the products of social construction. For each, the Element works through a 'toy' theory and then discusses features that more realistic theories ought to include. Three running examples are discussed throughout the Element: (1) property, or ownership; (2) race, or racialized kinds; (3) collective attitudes (i.e., beliefs, desires, knowledge, intentions, etc., of groups and organizations).

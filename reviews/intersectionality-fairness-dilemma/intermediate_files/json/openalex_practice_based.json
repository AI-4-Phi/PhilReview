The authors review archival, empirical, and theoretical literature that explores the use and effectiveness of these activities in the recreation movement and group work practice from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, the Hull House settlement in Chicago from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, and in recent group practice in social work and related fields. Findings suggest that art and music-based activities encourage and facilitate nondeliberative practice and allow for important opportunities to engage young people\u2019s strengths.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Focus group discussion is frequently used as a qualitative approach to gain an in\u2010depth understanding of social issues. The method aims to obtain data from a purposely selected group of individuals rather than from a statistically representative sample of a broader population. Even though the application of this method in conservation research has been extensive, there are no critical assessment of the application of the technique. In addition, there are no readily available guidelines for conservation researchers. Here, we reviewed the applications of focus group discussion within biodiversity and conservation research between 1996 and April 2017. We begin with a brief explanation of the technique for first\u2010time users. We then discuss in detail the empirical applications of this technique in conservation based on a structured literature review (using Scopus). The screening process resulted in 170 articles, the majority of which (67%, n = 114,) were published between 2011 and 2017. Rarely was the method used as a stand\u2010alone technique. The number of participants per focus group (where reported) ranged from 3 to 21 participants with a median of 10 participants. There were seven (median) focus group meetings per study. Focus group discussion sessions lasted for 90 (median) minutes. Four main themes emerged from the review: understanding of people's perspectives regarding conservation (32%), followed by the assessment of conservation and livelihoods practices (21%), examination of challenges and impacts of resource management interventions (19%) and documenting the value of indigenous knowledge systems (16%). Most of the studies were in Africa ( n = 76), followed by Asia ( n = 44), and Europe ( n = 30). We noted serious gaps in the reporting of the methodological details in the reviewed papers. More than half of the studies ( n = 101) did not report the sample size and group size ( n = 93), whereas 54 studies did not mention the number of focus group discussion sessions while reporting results. Rarely have the studies provided any information on the rationale for choosing the technique. We have provided guidelines to improve the standard of reporting and future application of the technique for conservation.",

      "abstract": "An exploration of how design might be led by marginalized communities, dismantle structural inequality, and advance collective liberation and ecological survival. What is the relationship between design, power, and social justice? \u201cDesign justice\u201d is an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities and that aims expilcitly to challenge, rather than reproduce, structural inequalities. It has emerged from a growing community of designers in various fields who work closely with social movements and community-based organizations around the world. This book explores the theory and practice of design justice, demonstrates how universalist design principles and practices erase certain groups of people\u2014specifically, those who are intersectionally disadvantaged or multiply burdened under the matrix of domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism)\u2014and invites readers to \u201cbuild a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.\u201d Along the way, the book documents a multitude of real-world community-led design practices, each grounded in a particular social movement. Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity in the technology and design professions; it connects design to larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological survival. The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Knowledge Unlatched and the MIT Press Frank Urbanowski Memorial Fund.",

      "abstract": "Research summary : Prior work on the benefits of business sustainability often applies short\u2010term causal logic and data analysis. In this article, we argue that the social and the environmental practices ( SEPs ) associated with business sustainability not only contribute to short\u2010term outcomes, but also to organizational resilience, which we define as the firm's ability to sense and correct maladaptive tendencies and cope positively with unexpected situations. Because organizational resilience is a latent, path\u2010dependent construct, we assess it through the long\u2010term outcomes, including improved financial volatility, sales growth, and survival rates. We tested these hypotheses with data from 121 U.S.\u2010based matched\u2010pairs (242 individual firms) over a 15\u2010year period. We also tested, but did not find support for, the relationship between SEPs and short\u2010term financial performance . Managerial summary : Most managers look for short\u2010term financial benefits to justify socially responsible or sustainable practices. In this article, we argue that such practices also help firms become more resilient, which helps them avoid crises and bounce back from shocks. However, it is difficult to measure the avoidance of shocks, so we analyzed long\u2010term outcomes. We show that firms that adopt responsible social and environmental practices, relative to a carefully matched control group, have lower financial volatility, higher sales growth, and higher chances of survival over a 15\u2010year period; yet, we were unable to find any differences in short\u2010term profits. We hope this research provides good reasons for firms to practice sustainability beyond the pursuit of short\u2010term profits . Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

This is a serious limitation because such evidence is crucial for funders and policy-makers and to establish RPGs as an evidence-based practice. There is also an absence of theoretical models to inform thinking about how RPGs might 'work' as an intervention to support workers and improve practice. Contributing new evidence to bridge these gaps, this paper reports a mixed-methods, longitudinal evaluation of RPGs within one local authority children's social work services department. The study advances the methods that have been used to investigate RPGs in the social work context and considers outcomes beyond that of the individual practitioner. The paper also presents a new theoretical model, based on these empirical findings, of how RPGs 'worked' and under what circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: This guideline provides recommendations for the clinical management of schizophrenia and related disorders for health professionals working in Australia and New Zealand. It aims to encourage all clinicians to adopt best practice principles. The recommendations represent the consensus of a group of Australian and New Zealand experts in the management of schizophrenia and related disorders. This guideline includes the management of ultra-high risk syndromes, first-episode psychoses and prolonged psychoses, including psychoses associated with substance use. It takes a holistic approach, addressing all aspects of the care of people with schizophrenia and related disorders, not only correct diagnosis and symptom relief but also optimal recovery of social function. Methods: The writing group planned the scope and individual members drafted sections according to their area of interest and expertise, with reference to existing systematic reviews and informal literature reviews undertaken for this guideline. In addition, experts in specific areas contributed to the relevant sections. All members of the writing group reviewed the entire document. The writing group also considered relevant international clinical practice guidelines. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated when the writing group judged that there was sufficient evidence on a topic. Where evidence was weak or lacking, consensus-based recommendations were formulated. Consensus-based recommendations are based on the consensus of a group of experts in the field and are informed by their agreement as a group, according to their collective clinical and research knowledge and experience. Key considerations were selected and reviewed by the writing group. To encourage wide community participation, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists invited review by its committees and members, an expert advisory committee and key stakeholders including professional bodies and special interest groups. Results: The clinical practice guideline for the management of schizophrenia and related disorders reflects an increasing emphasis on early intervention, physical health, psychosocial treatments, cultural considerations and improving vocational outcomes. The guideline uses a clinical staging model as a framework for recommendations regarding assessment, treatment and ongoing care. This guideline also refers its readers to selected published guidelines or statements directly relevant to Australian and New Zealand practice. Conclusions: This clinical practice guideline for the management of schizophrenia and related disorders aims to improve care for people with these disorders living in Australia and New Zealand. It advocates a respectful, collaborative approach; optimal evidence-based treatment; and consideration of the specific needs of those in adverse circumstances or facing additional challenges.",

      "abstract": "Genuine moral disagreement exists and is widespread. To understand such disagreement, we must examine the basic kinds of social relationships people construct across cultures and the distinct moral obligations and prohibitions these relationships entail. We extend relational models theory (Fiske, 1991) to identify 4 fundamental and distinct moral motives. Unity is the motive to care for and support the integrity of in-groups by avoiding or eliminating threats of contamination and providing aid and protection based on need or empathic compassion. Hierarchy is the motive to respect rank in social groups where superiors are entitled to deference and respect but must also lead, guide, direct, and protect subordinates. Equality is the motive for balanced, in-kind reciprocity, equal treatment, equal say, and equal opportunity. Proportionality is the motive for rewards and punishments to be proportionate to merit, benefits to be calibrated to contributions, and judgments to be based on a utilitarian calculus of costs and benefits. The 4 moral motives are universal, but cultures, ideologies, and individuals differ in where they activate these motives and how they implement them. Unlike existing theories (Haidt, 2007; Hauser, 2006; Turiel, 1983), relationship regulation theory predicts that any action, including violence, unequal treatment, and \"impure\" acts, may be perceived as morally correct depending on the moral motive employed and how the relevant social relationship is construed. This approach facilitates clearer understanding of moral perspectives we disagree with and provides a template for how to influence moral motives and practices in the world.",

An academic literature around coevolutionary innovation for sustainability has recently emerged as an attempt to understand the dynamics and directions of such sociotechnical transformations, which are termed \u2018sustainability transitions\u2019. This literature has previously focused on market-based technological innovations. Here we apply it to a new context of civil-society-based social innovation and examine the role of community-based initiatives in a transition to a low-carbon sustainable economy in the UK. We present new empirical research from a study of the UK's Transition Towns movement (a \u2018grassroots innovation\u2019) and assess its attempts to grow and influence wider societal sociotechnical systems. By applying strategic niche management theory to this civil society context, we deliver theoretically informed practical recommendations for this movement to diffuse beyond its niche: to foster deeper engagement with resourceful regime actors; to manage expectations more realistically by delivering tangible opportunities for action and participation; and to embrace a community-based, action-oriented model of social change (in preference to a cognitive theory of behaviour change). Furthermore, our study indicates areas where theory can be refined to better explain the growth and broader impacts of grassroots innovations\u2014namely, through a fuller appreciation of the importance of internal niche processes, by understanding the important role of identity and group formation, and by resolving how social practices change in grassroots innovations.",

It also proposes policy options to increase adoption, based on these behavioural factors and embedded in the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Behavioural factors are grouped into three clusters, from more distal to more proximal: (i) dispositional factors; (ii) social factors and (iii) cognitive factors. Overall, the review demonstrates that considering behavioural factors enriches economic analyses of farmer decision-making, and can lead to more realistic and effective agri-environmental policies.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews major approaches to leadership that have been pursued over the course of the two and a half millennia since classical scholars first turned their attention to this topic. Before setting out on this venture, it is important to recognize that this task is a formidable one. Cursory examination of any daily broadsheet shows that leadership is a constant topic of interest, debate, and speculation. In particular, it reveals a widespread fascination with the lives of leaders and with their individual psychology. How were they brought up? What key events shaped their intellectual and social development? What are their defining psychological characteristics and traits? What makes them so special? With a view toward imposing some semblance of order on this literature, and as a means of organizing attempts to understand and explain how researchers have approached questions of leadership, this chapter follows the structure suggested by Haslam, Reicher, and Platow (2011) in differentiating between three key research perspectives or traditions in the field: (a) a classical perspective based on the definition of leadership as the preserve of \"great men\" whose leadership is a reflection of their distinctive (and superior) personality, (b) a contextual perspective in which leadership is understood to be contingent on features of the social and organizational context that facilitate or else constrain leader effectiveness, and (c) an identity perspective that sees leadership as a relational process that centers on the group-based bonds between leaders and followers. As Haslam et al. (2011) observed, these different traditions also chart the historical development of thinking on leadership, with the classical perspective being \"old,\" the contextual perspective being more \"contemporary,\" and the identity perspective being relatively \"new.\" This chapter concludes by reflecting on some of the methodological and political dimensions of leadership research that feed into our understanding of this process. A key point here is that the attraction of different approaches needs to be understood not only in relation to empirical data but also in relation to the prejudices and practices that they support (e.g., those that seek to justify high executive salaries; Gemmill &amp; Oakley, 1992). In these terms, there is a need to engage with the political dimensions of leadership research as much as with the psychological",

      "abstract": "Urban ecosystem services are crucial for human well-being and the livability of cities. A central challenge for sustaining ecosystem services lies in addressing scale mismatches between ecological processes on one hand, and social processes of governance on the other. This article synthesizes a set of case studies from urban green areas in Stockholm, Sweden - allotment gardens, urban parks, cemeteries and protected areas - and discusses how governmental agencies and civil society groups engaged in urban green area management can be linked through social networks so as to better match spatial scales of ecosystem processes. The article develops a framework that combines ecological scales with social network structure, with the latter being taken as the patterns of interaction between actor groups. Based on this framework, the article (1) assesses current ecosystem governance, and (2) develops a theoretical understanding of how social network structure influences ecosystem governance and how certain actors can work as agents to promote beneficial network structures. The main results show that the mesoscale of what is conceptualized as city scale green networks (i.e., functionally interconnected local green areas) is not addressed by any actor in Stockholm, and that the management practices of civil society groups engaged in local ecosystem management play a crucial but neglected role in upholding ecosystem services. The article proposes an alternative network structure and discusses the role of midscale managers (for improving ecological functioning) and scale-crossing brokers (engaged in practices to connect actors across ecological scales). Dilemmas, strategies, and practices for establishing this governance system are discussed.",

The theories developed in the book are brought to life by examining real-life cases of norm creation and abandonment, the rationale behind policy interventions, and how change can be spearheaded by various types of trendsetters, be they individuals, groups, or the media. By exploring how a range of problems, from poor sanitation to child marriage, can be addressed, the book shows how social norms can have a causal impact on collective behavior, and which interventions may succeed in creating new norms or abandoning harmful ones. In laying the theoretical groundwork for implementing social changes in a contextually sensitive and empirically based way, it also diagnoses why some less culturally attuned attempts to eliminate negative practices have failed.",

      "abstract": "Solid waste management (SWM) is one of the key responsibilities of city administrators and one of the effective proxies for good governance. Effective SWM mitigates adverse health and environmental impacts, conserves resources, and improves the livability of cities. However, unsustainable SWM practices, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and financial and institutional limitations, negatively impact public health and environmental sustainability. This review article assesses the human and environmental health impacts of SWM practices in the Global South cities that are the future of global urbanization. The study employs desktop research methodology based on in-depth analysis of secondary data and literature, including official documents and published articles. It finds that the commonplace SWM practices include mixing household and commercial garbage with hazardous waste during storage and handling. While waste storage is largely in old or poorly managed facilities such as storage containers, the transportation system is often deficient and informal. The disposal methods are predominantly via uncontrolled dumping, open-air incinerators, and landfills. The negative impacts of such practices include air and water pollution, land degradation, emissions of methane and hazardous leachate, and climate change. These impacts impose significant environmental and public health costs on residents with marginalized social groups mostly affected. The paper concludes with recommendations for mitigating the public and environmental health risks associated with the existing SWM practices in the Global South.",

      "abstract": "In this age of multicultural democracy, the idea of assimilation--that the social distance separating immigrants and their children from the mainstream of American society closes over time--seems outdated and, in some forms, even offensive. But as Richard Alba and Victor Nee show in the first systematic treatment of assimilation since the mid-1960s, it continues to shape the immigrant experience, even though the geography of immigration has shifted from Europe to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Institutional changes, from civil rights legislation to immigration law, have provided a more favorable environment for nonwhite immigrants and their children than in the past. Assimilation is still driven, in claim, by the decisions of immigrants and the second generation to improve their social and material circumstances in America. But they also show that immigrants, historically and today, have profoundly changed our mainstream society and culture in the process of becoming Americans. Surveying a variety of domains--language, socioeconomic attachments, residential patterns, and intermarriage--they demonstrate the continuing importance of assimilation in American life. And they predict that it will blur the boundaries among the major, racially defined populations, as nonwhites and Hispanics are increasingly incorporated into the mainstream. Table of Contents: Preface 1. Rethinking Assimilation 2. Assimilation Theory, New and Old 3. Assimilation in Practice: The Europeans and East Asians 4. Was Assimilation Contingent on Specific Historical Conditions? 5. The Background to Contemporary Immigration 6. Evidence of Contemporary Assimilation 7. Conclusion: Remaking the Mainstream Notes Index Reviews of this book: Sociologists Alba and Nee provide a superb, comprehensive analysis of theory, data, and history to revise past and contemporary understandings of immigration and assimilation in the U.S. Their goal is to respond to skeptics' pessimism about new immigrants' assimilability, question misconception about the assimilation experiences of previous and current immigrant groups, reject normative baggage attached to notions of assimilation, and answer the question, 'What can assimilation look like in such a diverse and ethnically dynamic society?' --S. M. Green, Choice Alba and Nee have written a carefully theorized, thoughtfully argued, and empirically well-grounded book. They demonstrate persuasively that the so-called \"new\" immigration is not terribly different from previous ones, and that most of the descendants of today's Hispanic, Asian, and other newcomers are assimilating in much the same way as the children and grandchildren of the European immigration. Their contribution to our understanding of immigration, ethnicity and race should be read far beyond the worlds of social science scholarship. --Herbert J. Gans, Author of Democracy and the News Assimilation is dead, long live assimilation! Alba and Nee are fully aware of the flaws and biases in the old model of the \"melting pot,\" but they rehabilitate it with elegant theory, persuasive facts, and careful attention to its continued racial and class-based failings. The idea of assimilation may be unfashionable, but it has the singular virtue of fitting the case--for many Americans, at any rate--more than other trendier theories do. Remaking the American Mainstream shows us how, why, and to what end. --Jennifer L. Hochschild, co-Author, The American Dream and the Public Schools Alba and Nee have accomplished a tour de force . They have an important story to tell and they've told it with great verve and skill, using prose that will allow this book to be widely read. Remaking the American Mainstream is an outstanding work that is truly worthy of the important topic it addresses. --Roger Waldinger, author of Still the Promised City?: African-Americans and New Immigrants in Postindustrial New York No phenomenon is more central to the future shape of American life than assimilation - its contested meanings, the demand for it by established Americans, the powerful but mixed incentives for it by immigrants, its social history, and its future trajectory. Alba and Nee elucidate these crucial questions and supply provocative answers. Their book is a valuable Baedeker for anyone who visits the subject. --Peter Schuck, author of Diversity in America: Keeping Government at a Safe Distance",

      "abstract": "The article examines the characteristics of \u201cdigital children\u201d from the perspective of the theories of generations by Neil Howe and William Strauss, presents a modern interpretation of the theory in the works of domestic and foreign researchers. In domestic science, the characteristics of the digital generation are studied from the point of view of the psychological characteristics of representatives of the generation and the pedagogical influence on them, taking into account the informatization of educational institutions, the introduction of distance learning. This generation is characterized by a new - digital - type of socialization, which means the influence of the Internet technology and the virtual environment on the formation of values and attitudes, social practices of young people. Generation Z is a superior generation in many ways. It is the largest, most ethnically diverse and financially influential generation in human history. In the coming years, their characteristics will determine the formation of world culture, economy and politics. The youth of Generation Z inherits the degree of development of society, forms the image of the future, and is considered as the potential for the life of society. Due to insufficient practical development of this issue, there is a need for a systematic approach to studying the specific features of Generation Z, not only within the framework of the socio-psychological environment, but also the motives of their activities in political and socioeconomic systems, behavior patterns and features of their socialization. To examine the socio-psychological characteristics of the studied generation, the authors conducted a focus group study. In the study, the authors identified nine blocks for qualitative analysis: (1) characteristics of Generation Z; (2) relationship with parents; (3) leisure activities of Generation Z; (4) communication in network communities; (5) values of Generation Z; (6) positive and negative emotions of Generation Z; (7) communication with peers; (8) professional self-determination of Generation Z; (9) attitude towards patriotism. The highlighted blocks for analysis define a systematic approach to the study of characteristics and social practices. The study of isolated cases, subjective experiences of life situations and real practices that develop in various types of interaction allows us to understand the digital generation, to confirm or destroy the myths that have developed in the scientific community and the mass consciousness. The authors of the article draw conclusions about the characteristics and social practices of Generation Z, and the main forms of their interaction in the main spheres of life of modern society.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge hiding prevents colleagues from generating creative ideas, but it may also have negative consequences for the creativity of a knowledge hider. Drawing on social exchange theory, we propose that when employees hide knowledge, they trigger a reciprocal distrust loop in which coworkers are unwilling to share knowledge with them. We further suggest that these effects are contingent on motivational climate, in such a way that the negative effects of an individual's hiding knowledge on his/her own creativity are enhanced in a performance climate and attenuated in a mastery climate. A field study of 240 employees nested in 34 groups revealed a negative relationship between knowledge hiding and knowledge hiders' creativity as well as a moderating role of a mastery climate. Study 2 replicated these findings in an experimental study of 132 undergraduate students, testing a reciprocal distrust loop and comparing it with an alternative intrapsychic explanatory process based on situational regulatory focus. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This practical guide on mentalization-based treatment (MBT) of personality disorders outlines the mentalizing model of borderline and antisocial personality disorders and how it translates into clinical treatment. Mentalizing, the ability to understand oneself and others by inferring mental states that lie behind overt behavior, develops within the context of attachment relationships. It is crucial to self-regulation and constructive, intimate relationships, both of which are impaired in personality disorders because of proneness to losing mentalizing at times of anxiety and attachment stress. Loss of mentalizing leads to interpersonal and social problems, emotional variability, impulsivity, self-destructive behaviors, and violence. The book, divided into four parts\u2014the mentalizing framework, mentalizing practice, mentalizing groups, and mentalizing systems\u2014covers the aims and structure of treatment, outlines how patients are introduced to the mentalizing model so that their personality disorder makes sense to them, explains why certain interventions are recommended and others are discouraged, and systematically describes the process of treatment in both group and individual therapy to support more stable mentalizing. People with personality disorders commonly have comorbid mental health problems, such as depression and eating disorders, which complicate clinical treatment. The clinician is advised how to manage comorbidity in treatment. Mentalizing problems in families and social systems, for example, schools and mental health services, are also covered. A families and carers training and support guide is provided, as families and others are often neglected during the treatment of people with personality disorders.",

      "abstract": "We compared perceived cultural stereotypes of diverse groups varying by gender and ethnicity. Using a free-response procedure, we asked 627 U.S. undergraduates to generate 10 attributes for 1 of 17 groups: Asian Americans, Blacks, Latinos, Middle Eastern Americans, or Whites; men or women; or 10 gender-by-ethnic groups (e.g., Black men or Latina women). Based on intersectionality theory and social dominance theory, we developed and tested three hypotheses. First, consistent with the intersectionality hypothesis, gender-by-ethnic stereotypes contained unique elements that were not the result of adding gender stereotypes to ethnic stereotypes. Second, in support of an ethnicity hypothesis, stereotypes of ethnic groups were generally more similar to stereotypes of the men than of the women in each group. Third, a gender hypothesis postulated that stereotypes of men and women will be most similar to stereotypes of White men and White women, less similar to ethnic minority men and ethnic minority women, and least similar to Black men and Black women. This hypothesis was confirmed for target women, but results for target men were mixed. Collectively, our results contribute to research, theory, and practice by demonstrating that ethnic and gender stereotypes are complex and that the intersections of these social categories produce meaningful differences in the way groups are perceived.",

      "abstract": "The core claims of the practice turn in International Relations (IR) remain ambiguous. What promises does international practice theory hold for the field? How does the kind of theorizing it produces differ from existing perspectives? What kind of research agenda does it produce? This article addresses these questions. Drawing on the work of Andreas Reckwitz, we show that practice approaches entail a distinctive view on the drivers of social relations. Practice theories argue against individualistic-interest and norm-based actor models. They situate knowledge in practice rather than \u201cmental frames\u201d or \u201cdiscourse.\u201d Practice approaches focus on how groups perform their practical activities in world politics to renew and reproduce social order. They therefore overcome familiar dualisms\u2014agents and structures, subjects and objects, and ideational and material\u2014that plague IR theory. Practice theories are a heterogeneous family, but, as we argue, share a range of core commitments. Realizing the promise of the practice turn requires considering the full spectrum of its approaches. However, the field primarily draws on trajectories in international practice theory that emphasize reproduction and hierarchies. It should pay greater attention to practice approaches rooted in pragmatism and that emphasize contingency and change. We conclude with an outline of core challenges that the future agenda of international practice theory must tackle.",

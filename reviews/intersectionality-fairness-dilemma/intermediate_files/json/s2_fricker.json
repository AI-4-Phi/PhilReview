      "abstract": "\n In her groundbreaking book, Epistemic Injustice, renowned moral philosopher and social epistemologist Miranda Fricker coined the term epistemic injustice to draw attention to the pervasive impact of epistemic oppression on marginalized social groups. Fricker\u2019s account spurred a flurry of scholarship regarding the discriminatory impact of epistemic injustice and gave birth to a domain of philosophical inquiry that has extended far beyond the disciplinary boundaries of philosophy. In this interview, Fricker responds to questions posed by A. C. Nikolaidis and Winston C. Thompson that address the ways in which epistemic injustice intersects with education as a human endeavor and social institution. In doing so, Fricker reflects on her motivations in writing her book more than 15 years ago and explicitly addresses some of the most significant contributions of the concept of epistemic injustice as a tool for analyzing issues in education. She also offers insights on the purpose of education, outlines educational manifestations of epistemic injustice, and discusses the virtues that educators must exhibit and inculcate in their students in order for epistemic justice to obtain.",

      "abstract": "The research field of epistemic justice in healthcare has gained traction in the last decade. However, the importation of Miranda Fricker\u2019s original philosophical framework to medicine raises several interrelated issues that have largely escaped attention. Instead of pushing forward, crafting new concepts or exploring other medical conditions, we suggest that it is time to take stock, reconsider, and articulate some fundamental issues that confront the field of epistemic injustice in healthcare. This paper articulates such fundamental issues, which we divide into scientific, conceptual, and theoretical issues. Scientifically, the research field is confronted by a lack of empirical evidence. It relies on cases, making generalizations impossible and the field vulnerable to bias. Conceptually, many of the claims advanced in the literature are presented as facts but are merely hypotheses to be tested. Moreover, a criterion for applying the concept of testimonial injustice in medicine is lacking, impeding the development of a construct to empirically measure said injustices. Theoretically, many of the cases discussed in the literature do not prima facie qualify as cases of testimonial injustice, since they lack necessary components of testimonial injustice in Fricker\u2019s framework, i.e., being unintentional and caused by identity prejudices in the hearers. If epistemic injustice is as pervasive as it is claimed in this literature, it should be of concern to us all. Addressing the issues raised here may strengthen the conceptualization of epistemic injustice in healthcare and lead to development of constructs that finally can explore its empirical basis.",

While Miranda Fricker's concepts help highlight the neglect of chronic pain sufferers\u2009\u2013\u2009such as healthcare professionals' failure to take reports seriously (testimonial injustice) or the lack of adequate language to communicate pain experiences (hermeneutical injustice) \u2013 we argue that applying these frameworks overlooks important nuances. Specifically, we contend that there is an additional, distinct epistemic failure in how healthcare providers engage with chronic pain complaints: a failure to respond to these reports in adequate ways, beyond merely understanding or believing them. We hypothesize that it has to do with inquisitive inertia (a decision not to investigate further, in the absence of good medical reasons to ground such a decision), and we conceptualize this failure in terms of distributive epistemic injustice, that may persist even in the absence of testimonial or hermeneutical injustices as they are traditionally understood.",

We suggest that the ethical and methodological precautions taken towards \u2018vulnerable populations\u2019 may be detrimental to research participants, as their voices might be silenced, or their interpretations might be excluded from the research. To address this issue, we put the concept of vulnerability in research ethics into dialogue with the normative framework of epistemic injustice as developed by Miranda Fricker. In doing so, we discuss how epistemic injustices may occur, but also how they may be resisted through ethical and methodological considerations based on a more critical understanding of vulnerability. We start this article by tracing and problematizing the often-used understanding of vulnerability as rooted in the biomedical field. We then discuss the skepticism of social scientists regarding the idea of vulnerability, before presenting its reconceptualization from critical and feminist scholars. Finally, we show how using vulnerability in research ethics can lead to either the maintaining or resisting of dynamics of epistemic injustice in qualitative research. To illustrate this proposition, we use examples from qualitative field research and discuss our research process in relation to participants.",

Gore\u2019s account of institutional treatment exposes a system that reduces the patient to measurable symptoms while ignoring her narrative agency. By examining how the memoir critiques biomedical dismissal and insists on the ethical centrality of storytelling, this paper advocates for a care model that restores epistemic credibility to patients through narrative attention, representation, and affiliation.",

We argue that much of the literature on epistemic injustice is formulated within a specific Western world\u2010picture, and we discuss its implications. A significant source of this confinement is the view of language as merely a tool for communication. Drawing on Wittgenstein, we argue that this way of conceiving language ignores its deeper connections to our forms of life and that the generalization of epistemic injustice definitions, intended to be universally applicable, perpetuates intergenerational formative epistemic injustice, which has persisted since colonial times. This, in turn, limits epistemic capacity formation and the theory's applicability in different contexts, such that claims of including marginalized ways of knowing may, in fact, facilitate their co\u2010optation and assimilation within a Western framework. Given the global diversity of epistemic harm and its intergenerational character, this article argues that the disaggregation of the scholarship and the recognition of diverse world\u2010pictures as constitutive of its conceptual formation are essential to disrupting epistemic injustice.",

Yet for all its normative insights into social silencing, I argue that Fricker\u2019s theorization of epistemic dysfunction remains too individualized, cognitivist, and dematerialized to account for racialized imaginaries. Rather than view racisms as normal and normative in racist cultures, Fricker frames identity-driven prejudice as a troubling aberration from otherwise unblemished epistemic and moral norms. This leads her into adopting an overly voluntarist and idealist theory of social change that centres training better knowers rather than unmaking racialized worlds. Ultimately, I contend that we should return to a materialist theory of ideology, following the work of Stuart Hall. Doing so jettisons the narrow focus on individual epistemic failures and instead problematizes how certain social ideas consolidate and reproduce racial hierarchies.",

In this article, I draw on blending theory\u2014a theory of cognition\u2014and theories of epistemic injustice to explore both the epistemic and ethical implications of metaphors. Beginning with a discussion of the conceptual alterations that may result from the use of metaphors, I argue that the effects these alterations have on available hermeneutical resources have the potential to result in a type of hermeneutical injustice distinct from the \u201clacuna\u201d described by Miranda Fricker (Fricker 2007). Following, I examine how metaphors may therefore be considered \u201cethically bad epistemic practice,\u201d as described by Rebecca Mason, because of how they may contribute to perpetuating an inequitable epistemic status quo (Mason 2011). Yet these same features may be used to promote epistemic justice in the context of intersectional power relationships. Situating the effects of metaphors within an inequitable yet dynamic epistemic system, I argue that foregrounding intersectional power dynamics enables us to interrogate the ethics of metaphors with consideration of both the epistemic and material consequences that may occur. I conclude by providing guidance for how, given that metaphors do epistemic work, we may use them to do ethical epistemic work.",

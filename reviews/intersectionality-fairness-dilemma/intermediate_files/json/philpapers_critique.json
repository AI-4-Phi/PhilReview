      "snippet": "First, I diagnose the problems of the current methodology for algorithmic fairness, which I call \u201cformal algorithmic fairness.\u201d Because formal algorithmic fairness restricts analysis to isolated decision-making procedures, it leads to the impossibility of fairness and to models that exacerbate oppression despite appearing \u201cfair.\u201d Second, I draw on theories of substantive equality from law and philosophy to propose an alternative methodology, which I call \u201csubstantive algorithmic fairness.\u201d Because substantive algorithmic fairness takes a more expansive scope of analysis, it enables an escape from the impossibility of fairness and provides a rigorous guide for alleviating injustice with algorithms.",

In the insurance industry, the concept of actuarial fairness serves to establish what could be adequate, fair premiums.",

      "snippet": "For this reason, a large literature in machine learning speaks of a \u201cfairness tradeoff\u201d between these two measures. This framing assumes that both measures are, in fact, capturing something important. To date, philosophers have seldom examined this crucial assumption, and examined to what extent each measure actually tracks a normatively important property. This makes this inevitable statistical conflict \u2013 between calibration and false positive rate equality \u2013 an important topic for ethics.",

Statistical discrimination describes a set of informational issues that can induce rational (i.e., Bayesian) decision-making to lead to unfair outcomes even in the absence of discriminatory intent.",

In particular, it focuses on feminist philosophy\u2019s engagement with intersectionality as the most productive site of the field\u2019s engagement with critical race theory. The chapter discusses the meaning of intersectionality and the importance of understanding the concept not only in terms of the field of critical race theory but also as a philosophical contribution of the Black feminist intellectual tradition. The chapter explores how Black feminist philosophers and other feminist philosophers of color have resisted the move towards operational intersectionality and opened productive, liberatory ways forward for intersectional work within feminist philosophy as a critical practice rooted in the lived experiences of women of color.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to add to the recent scholarly search for African leadership philosophy to improve leadership effectiveness in Africa. It examines the Oromo Gada system\u2019s democratic governance and leadership principles and argues its relevance to the current and future leadership effectiveness in Oromia, Ethiopia, and Africa. It analyses the literature on the history, culture, and current practices of the Gada system to identify its leadership philosophies. It discusses these principles by comparing with Ubuntu and other indigenous African leadership philosophies on the one hand with UN principles of good governance on the other. Evidences show that in spite of the expansion of modern education and leadership training; there are little or no evidence of leadership effectiveness in Africa. Corruption, poverty, injustice, and lack of legitimacy and accountability have continued to be the images of Africa and its leadership. These leadership failures are attributed to lack of leadership that connects with the societal values and cultures. The adoption of Gada leadership principles of liberty, equality, morality, rule of law, participation and engagement of citizens, decision making by consensus, separation of power and check and balance, decentralized governance, fixed terms office and peaceful transfer of power, accountability, transparency and impeachment of elected leaders, honesty, team leadership and conflict transformation in political, public and private sector organization leadership are discussed. The development and adoption of Gada, Ubuntu, and other indigenous leadership philosophies is recommended as a remedy to Africa\u2019s leadership problems.",

Some have responded to this problem by abandoning intersectionality; others have attempted to find some suitably inclusive way of reconceptualizing woman. I provide a novel solution that focuses on conceptualizing oppression in light of intersectionality, rather than trying to provide an account of what it is to be a woman. By enabling us to understand feminism as responding to gender oppression, this account shows that intersectionality does not conceptually undermine and fragment feminism. Feminism should be intersectional.",

It investigates how feminist thinkers have challenged traditional concepts of power, redefined autonomy, and reconstructed liberation beyond patriarchal and colonial frameworks. Drawing on the works of Paulo Freire, bell hooks, Mar\u00eda Lugones, and various postcolonial and indigenous feminists, this paper argues that liberation is not merely a structural or political objective, but a transformative praxis grounded in ethics, relationality, and epistemic resistance. It further analyzes global and local feminist movements to show how women create and enact liberatory spaces through both resistance and reimagination. The article emphasizes the importance of intersectionality, consciousness-raising, and care ethics in the ongoing struggle for freedom and justice.",

First, I examine the case of the domestic household servant as a paradigm of the legal legitimation of social domination in Kant\u2019s legal philosophy. Second, I explore the intersectionality of gender, race, and class in the outsourcing of care tasks available to wealthy European women in Kant\u2019s theory of labour. Third, I bring Kant\u2019s theory into a critical dialogue with some contemporary challenges of a democratic and equal society. Finally, I draw some conclusions about concrete forms of intersectional domination and exploitation underpinning Kant\u2019s republicanism, before proposing that they are clearly inconsistent, insofar as they exclude large groups of people from the republican demos, even if they essentially contribute to its social reproduction.",

In this paper, we argue that philosophy as a discipline is uniquely well-positioned to think through the marginalisation suffered by women and other minorities. We therefore interrogate two values that already undergird conversations about inclusion\u2014 representation and intersectionality\u2014in order to think about the path ahead. We argue that, once we have done so, it becomes clear that the slow pace of improvement over the last few decades is unacceptable and more radical steps need to be taken. First, we outline the current state of women in philosophy focusing on three areas: levels of employment, publishing, and sexual harassment. Then we turn to representation and intersectionality respectively. We conclude by arguing that many women and people of colour have been arguing for a more radically diverse philosophy for many years. What we are facing is a lack of ambition on the one hand and problem of attention on the other.",

Said roundtable begins with a critical self-positioning of the participants\u2019 (inter)disciplinary and embodied locations using examples from their own research. The conversation then progresses to how these researchers have employed contemporary theories, conceptual vocabularies, methods, and analyses of gender, sexuality, and embodiment in digital spheres to then conclude with some ethico-political notes about collaborations between scholars and (digital) activists.\n",

      "abstract": "What is the intersectional thesis a thesis about? Some understand it as a claim about the metaphysics of oppression, social kinds, or experience; about the limits of antidiscrimination law or identity politics; or about the importance of fuzzy sets and multifactor analysis in social science. We argue, however, that intersectionality, interpreted as a thesis in any particular theoretical domain, faces regress problems. We propose that headway on these and other questions can be made when intersectionality is modeled as a regulative ideal, i.e., a guiding methodological and practical principle, and not as a general theory or hypothesis. Qua ideal, intersectionality requires activists and inquirers to treat existing classification schemes as if they are indefinitely mutually informing, with the specific aim of revealing and resisting inequality and injustice. Qua regulative, intersectionality points to a rich and expanding set of heuristics for guiding social-scientific research and the construction of multifaceted political coalitions.",

The argument of this article is that we need to address Kierkegaard\u2019s biases in order to bring out the relevance of his work on human identity in the 21st century. Rather than investigate a specific biased topic, I want to articulate the way in which Kierkegaard\u2019s biases present a serious problem for his account of identity, in particular with regard to his concepts of eternity and freedom. I spend the first part of this article examining problems in Kierkegaard\u2019s approach to identity before turning to the strengths of his work in the second part. I use Theodor W. Adorno\u2019s critique of Kierkegaard and Michael Theunissen\u2019s development of this critique to bring out both the weaknesses and the strengths of Kierkegaard\u2019s approach to the challenges of human identity.",

      "abstract": "Disputes about how to understand intersectional relations often pivot around the tension between separateness and inseparability, where some scholars emphasize the need to separate between different intersectional categories while others claim they are inseparable. In this article the author takes issue with the either/or thinking that underpins an unnecessary and unproductive polarization in the debate over the in/separability of intersectional categories. Drawing on Roy Bhaskar\u2019s dialectical critical realist philosophy, the author argues that we can think of intersectional categories as well as different ontological levels as both distinct and unified and elaborates on the issue of how significance of the dialectical notion of unity-in-difference for intersectional studies. As part of the argument the author addresses the issue of what it actually means for something to be distinct or separate as opposed to inseparable or unified with something else, demonstrating that lack of clarity about this is at the heart of polarized arguments about separateness versus inseparability in intersectionality theory.",

There\u2019s a whole journal dedicated to intersectional thought: The Journal of Intersectionality. Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, the black feminist legal theorist credited with coining the term, has a 2016 TED talk titled \u2018The Urgency of Intersectionality\u2019. The agreed conclusions of the United Nations 61st Commission on the Status of Women included the phrase \u2018multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination\u2019 four times. It is common for university campuses to be plastered with posters reading \u2018if your feminism isn\u2019t intersectional, it\u2019s bullshit\u2019. Popular pieces on the topic have appeared in The Conversation, The Guardian, Vox, and even Time. It\u2019s absolutely clear, to anyone who has any contact with feminism at all\u2014 activist or academic\u2014 that their feminism had better be intersectional. Less clear is exactly what that means. Here\u2019s one gloss: features of identity intersect to create a subject of new forms of oppression. For example, sex and class intersect to produce the subject of workingclass women\u2019s oppression; race and sex intersect to produce the subject of black women\u2019s oppression. Many people who advocate intersectionality would probably agree with this gloss. But if we were to take the observation at face value, it wouldn\u2019t be obvious why it\u2019s",

In introducing this Special Issue, we revisit its core assumptions and contradictions in order to reimagine capitalism and reflect on the potential of management studies to contribute alternatives. These aspirations are reflected in the contributions. They discuss Indigenous views of capitalism, the ethics of care, insights from self\u2010determination theory, the logic of marketization, and how capitalist institutions foster violence, racism, inequality, and environmental crisis. Building from these insights, we discuss the potential for future research to draw on a combined critical lens of\n place\n and\n intersectionality\n in developing systemic analyses of capitalism. Place situates action in its meaningful social and geographical spaces, recognizing the specific historical, political, and community relations through which global forces are (re\u2010)produced and experienced. Intersectionality interrogates the capitalist system through various axes of identity to understand its consequences and inequalities. We use this framing to assess key aspects of contemporary capitalism: labour markets, globalization and global value chains, and access to resources. We then reflect on the prospects for alternative imaginings of capitalism and how management research might contribute to these.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract:The social uprisings in the United States during the summer of 2020 renewed public discussion of forms of domination embedded into the social contracts of Western democracies. These discussions echo insights from within political philosophy regarding the domination contract. Despite numerous attempts to shed light on myriad aspects of the domination contract, an analysis of the role of colonialism and coloniality has yet to be sufficiently engaged by political philosophers, particularly within social contract theory. Drawing on the frameworks of intersectionality and decolonial feminism, this article examines the interweavings between two prominent domination contracts, the racia-sexual contract and the colonial contract, to better account for the systematic exclusion of Black, Indigenous, and other women of color (BIWOC) from liberal social contracts that are foundationally predicated on forms of gendered, racialized, colonial domination.",

This article introduces the feminist perspective of intersectionality to medical ethical debates on aging and old age in order to analyze the structural discrimination of older people in medicine and health care. While current intersectional approaches in this field focus on race, gender, and sexuality, we thus set out to introduce aging and old age as an additional category that is becoming more relevant in the context of longer life expectancies and increasing population aging. We analyze three exemplary cases on the individual, institutional, and public health level, and argue that considering the intersections of old age with other social categories helps to accommodate the diverse identities of older people and detect inequality and structural discrimination.",

Feminist thinkers have challenged this tradition, arguing that it reflects a narrow and exclusionary view of the world. The present article examines the ways in which feminist philosophers have contributed to expanding the philosophical canon through their critiques of traditional philosophy and the inclusion of previously marginalized perspectives. Drawing on the principles of intersectionality, feminist thinkers have highlighted the ways in which various forms of oppression intersect and reinforce one another. By doing so, they have exposed the limitations of traditional philosophical approaches and expanded the scope of philosophical inquiry. This article argues that the work of feminist philosophers has not only enriched the philosophical canon, but also helped to challenge and transform the dominant cultural narratives that have historically excluded marginalized voices. Ultimately, this article advocates for greater recognition and inclusion of feminist perspectives in the philosophical canon, as a means of promoting a more diverse and inclusive understanding of the world.",

In the first section, she discusses the emergence of trans studies as well as the recent development of trans philosophy within the discipline. The latter makes the question of feminist philosophical engagement more complex. To what extent does the feminist philosophy engage with trans philosophy? To what extent does it merely philosophize about trans phenomena? In the second section, Bettcher considers an approach that adds trans to a longer list of excluded identities, focusing specifically on analytic work designed to answer the question \u201cWhat is a woman?\u201d Drawing on Crenshaw\u2019s notion of intersectionality, Bettcher raises worries about this sort of approach in both its traditional and ameliorative variations. In the final section, Bettcher considers intersectional approaches to trans oppression/resistance as well as impediments to their pursuit including oppositional starting points, unhelpful models of trans oppression/resistance, and, finally, complexities that arise when considering the intersections of trans and sexist oppressions.",

In this essay, I outline an ecofeminist theology which addresses how the current ecological crisis we face\u2014including but not limited to, climate change, mass species extinction, ocean acidification, the rise in wildfires and superstorms, glacial melt, pollution\u2014are tied to problematic and incorrect ideologies. To do this, I utilize Val Plumwood\u2019s robust ecofeminist philosophy to revealing harmful dualisms implicit in all forms of oppression. I critique transcendental monotheism for extracting life, God, and agency from the natural world. If God exists over and above the Earth, and this God is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, this justifies the problematic lagged response to our urgent ecological crisis. In short, my ecofeminist theology (1) affirms intersectionality. It considers racial injustice and systemic racism are intertwined with the ecological crises. We cannot address our ecological crisis without also addressing racial injustice. (2) It critiques a transcendental monotheistic God as this reinforces irresponsible and apathetic responses to our multi-faceted ecological crisis. And (3) it affirms Plumwood\u2019s \u201cphilosophical animism\u201d as a way to retrieve nature in the active voice. By retrieving nature in the active voice, we retrieve a sense of groundedness in place through relationships with non-humans. Her \u201cphilosophical animism\u201d affirms agency in the natural world without culturally appropriating Indigenous cultures. It is a way for Westerners to enter into dialogical relationship with the natural world. It is both political\u2014affirming the rights of Black, Indigenous, and other people of color\u2014and it is personal\u2014engaging in a practice of the wild (Gary Snyder).",

On the one hand this occurs as gender becomes explicitly part of the very ways of being under modernity, and this means that gender, race, and labor are always entangled in the coloniality of power. As a result decolonial thought may only occur by the critique of one's concrete situation in the living intersectionality in which identities and power relations are founded. This turn to concrete intersectionality occurs as Lugones thinks in light of cosmological indigenous lineages in Am\u00e9rica, and with this turn engages not only the logical, epistemic, and conceptual levels of coloniality but, in a turn that makes possible the affirmation of subjugated knowledges, she turns to the aisthetic dimensions of the coloniality of power and knowledge: Most significantly, in this way, she is able to begin to think with the liberatory rhythms, movements, practices that are our lives as sites of resistance and contestation never subsumed (abarcadas) by the coloniality of power, modernity, and capitalism.",

Intersection Theory can be conceived as encompassing other progressive theories, such as Philosophy of Race and Feminism. In Philosophy of Race, the ultimate explanatory concept is race; in Feminism, the ultimate explanatory term is gender. This discrepancy has given rise to Black Feminism. Intersection Theory can also be contextualized and expanded to include more detailed intersections when there is inequality within intersected groups. But, intersectionality does yet address unpredictable violence, either against blacks or normally advantaged groups, such as United States Jews. For such cases, it is useful to posit a new intersectional factor of regressive violence, to account for counter-revolutionary response to decades of progress for minorities. Overall, the flexibility of Intersection Theory allows for creative analysis. However, not all intersections yield politically viable identities and those that would might require governmental recognition of group rights.",

This paper encapsulates a comprehensive review that delves into the ethical and sustainable dimensions of business analytics, probing the philosophical underpinnings that shape the responsible use of data in corporate decision-making. The review examines the moral considerations inherent in business analytics, investigating the ethical implications of data collection, analysis, and utilization. It contemplates the evolving landscape of data privacy, transparency, and the ethical responsibilities of businesses in the era of pervasive data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, the paper explores sustainability in business analytics, acknowledging the environmental impact of data centers, energy consumption, and the life cycle of digital technologies. It evaluates the philosophical principles guiding sustainable practices in the field, aiming to harmonize the pursuit of data-driven insights with ecological responsibility. In essence, this study outlines a comprehensive exploration of how philosophy shapes and guides sustainable and ethical approaches in the domain of business analytics. It sets the stage for a critical examination of the evolving intersection between data-driven decision-making and the ethical principles that underpin responsible corporate practices. \nKeywords: Philosophy, Business Analytics, Sustainable, Ethical Approaches, Review.",

      "abstract": "Work at the intersection of philosophy and psychiatry has an extensive and influential history, and has received increased attention recently, with the emergence of professional associations and a growing literature. In this paper, we review key advances in work on philosophy and psychiatry, and their related clinical implications. First, in understanding and categorizing mental disorder, both naturalist and normativist considerations are now viewed as important \u2013 psychiatric constructs necessitate a consideration of both facts and values. At a conceptual level, this integrative view encourages moving away from strict scientism to soft naturalism, while in clinical practice this facilitates both evidence\u2010based and values\u2010based mental health care. Second, in considering the nature of psychiatric science, there is now increasing emphasis on a pluralist approach, including ontological, explanatory and value pluralism. Conceptually, a pluralist approach acknowledges the multi\u2010level causal interactions that give rise to psychopathology, while clinically it emphasizes the importance of a broad range of \u201cdifference\u2010makers\u201d, as well as a consideration of \u201clived experience\u201d in both research and practice. Third, in considering a range of questions about the brain\u2010mind, and how both somatic and psychic factors contribute to the development and maintenance of mental disorders, conceptual and empirical work on embodied cognition provides an increasingly valuable approach. Viewing the brain\u2010mind as embodied, embedded and enactive offers a conceptual approach to the mind\u2010body problem that facilitates the clinical integration of advances in both cognitive\u2010affective neuroscience and phenomenological psychopathology.",

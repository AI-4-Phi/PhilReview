      "abstract": "\n Precision medicine (PM) encompasses various emerging, data-intensive healthcare and biomedical research initiatives aimed at tailoring care to individual patient characteristics. While \u201cprecision\u201d primarily denotes an epistemological shift in how biomedical research is approached and care delivered, the conviction that PM empowers patients in clinical decision-making is central to its vision as it is taken up across policy contexts. In this paper, I critically assess these promises by drawing on recent engagements in agential epistemic injustice (Lackey 2020; Medina 2022). I suggest that the social, cultural, and epistemological conditions in which the epistemic practice of precision care unfolds are conducive to epistemic injustice. Despite PM\u2019s explicit aims to address longstanding criticisms regarding the disease-centric nature of contemporary biomedical care practices by including person-centered, non-biomedical features in clinical consideration, exploring its underlying logic suggests its epistemic economy is stacked against patients\u2019 epistemic interests. As such, despite its laudable aim of patient empowerment, the exacerbated risk of epistemic injustice might truncate patients\u2019 (epistemic) agency, further disempowering them in clinical decision-making. To conclude, I suggest that the reliance on \u201cempowerment\u201d- and \u201cperson-centered care\u201d-rhetoric dominating PM discourse is a case of epistemic appropriation (Davis 2018), further discouraging engagement with social, experiential, and phenomenological dimensions of illness, defanging critics of raising those concerns, and impeding the realization of epistemic justice in healthcare.",

Although digital phenotyping is regarded as a promising tool for transforming psychiatric clinical practice, its potential to exacerbate epistemic injustice remains a central ethical concern. However, epistemic injustice in psychiatric digital phenotyping should be understood as rooted in specific forms of ignorance, which are not necessarily negative obstacles. On the contrary, phenomenological, objective and structural ignorance in psychiatric digital phenotyping can be leveraged to enhance patient epistemic empowerment and thereby help to overcome epistemic injustice.",

Both kinds of injustice result from structural social prejudice and can especially disadvantage some groups but not others. In the real world, these two types of injustice are embodied in the design and practice of AI. Based on gender-biased data, AI further exacerbates the Testimonial Injustice women suffered when processing and accessing information. And the low participation rate of women in occupations such as Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics results in the low diversity and inclusiveness of AI technologies and exacerbates the Hermeneutic Injustice faced by women. Therefore, in the era of AI, these two types of injustice are practiced by new technologies and manifested in the aggravation of existing gender biases against women.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we analyse a comprehensive database (from 1960 to June 2024) of scientific publications in AI Ethics (n= 5755) using Web of Science (WoS) as a data source, to generate quantitative insights around the research trends within the field. We systematically curate the initial data to conduct a co-authorship and co-citation analysis with highly cited research outputs (n = 500) and a co-word analysis with most relevant research outputs (n = 1000). These bibliometric analyses result in multiple networked visualisations that map the status quo and the nature of current citational and collaborative practices among the experts, institutions and countries involved in global AI Ethics research. Using Sheila Jasanoff\u2019s co-production theory as a conceptual lens, we analyse these findings and show that the experts from the Global North currently legitimise their expertise in AI Ethics through dynamic citational and collaborative practices in knowledge production within the field. Collectively, they shape the discourses and institutional ways of understanding around the ethical development of AI technologies worldwide. This techno-politics of knowledge-making in AI Ethics culminates in creating epistemic injustice for the Global South. Drawing from Miranda Fricker and prominent feminist and postcolonial theorists, we explain how such injustice is produced and distributed through patterned pathways of co-production of AI Ethics. Thus, we show that the global project of AI Ethics fails to deliver its promise to be universally useful by keeping the global majority populations in the Southern regions marginalized as \u2018others\u2019.",

These apps can, thus, serve as epistemic tools for affected users. From an ethical perspective, it is crucial to consider epistemic injustice to promote socially responsible innovations within digital mental healthcare. In cases of epistemic injustice, people are wronged specifically as epistemic agents, i.e., agents of the production and distribution of knowledge. We suggest that epistemic agency relies on different resource- and uptake-related preconditions which can be impacted by the functionality of passive self-tracking apps. We consider how this can lead to different forms of epistemic injustice (testimonial, hermeneutical, and contributory injustice) and analyze the influence of the apps\u2019 use on epistemic practices on an individual level, in mental healthcare settings, and on the structural level.",

      "abstract": "While there has been growing scholarly interest in the role of religious literacy in K-12 teacher education, scholarship on how preservice teachers understand religious literacy as an aim of social justice-oriented education remains limited. This empirical case study of one teacher education program in a Canadian university examines the perspectives of preservice teachers and how they view critical religious literacy (CRL) as a means of addressing the potential harms of religious illiteracy. Using empirical data collected in personal interviews and focus groups, this qualitative case study employed philosophical analysis centered on a theoretical framework that includes the concept of epistemic injustice. The data show that preservice educators feel unprepared to engage with religiously diverse students, to navigate issues related to religious diversity, or to respond to the potential epistemic harms of religious illiteracy, such as exclusion, discrimination, or polarization. As such, this paper contends that to reduce the potential epistemic injustices related to religious illiteracy in their programs and in K-12 classrooms, teacher educators ought to include CRL as an educational aim in preservice teacher education.",

This article works through Miranda Fricker\u2019s attempt to position herself between Marx and Foucault.

Foucault\u2019s emphasis on structures explains some of the gaps in Fricker\u2019s account of hermeneutical injustice, especially the need to emphasize the embeddedness of epistemic practices in institutions, and their resulting irreducibly political nature.

The presented article aims to philosophically consider the ethical consequences of studying people experiencing epistemic injustice using the autobiographical narrative interview technique. Recognizing that individuals and groups subjected to treatment bearing its hallmarks do not have the appropriate means to express their experiences, and their perspective is not understood and considered in society, the author guesses that this impacts the process of reconstructing experiences during interviews. In other words, this article aims to reflect on the importance of the impact of epistemic injustice on the data obtained in interviews and to try to identify ways to minimize its impact on the research process and the conclusions formulated within it.",

We argue that citizen science can be seen as one element of \u201cdeliberative systems,\u201d as described by Mansbridge et al. But in order to fulfil its democratic potential, citizen science needs to be attentive to various forms of exclusion and epistemic injustice, as analyzed by Fricker, Medina and others. Moreover, to tap the potentials of citizen science from the perspective of deliberative democracy, it needs to move towards a more empowered approach, in which citizens do not only deliver data points, but also, in invited or uninvited settings, participate in discussions about the goals and implications of research. Integrating citizen science into the deliberative systems approach embeds it in a broader framework of democratic theory and suggests the transmission of certain practical strategies (e.g., randomized sampling). It can also contribute to realism about both the potentials and the limits of citizen science. As part of a deliberative system, citizen science cannot, and need not, be the only place in which reforms are necessary for creating stronger ties between science and society and for aligning science with democratic values.",

      "abstract": "\"Conducting ethical case discussions is a core aspect of any clinical ethics support service or work as an ethical consultant in a hospital. Numerous case discussion methods can be used to do this, many of which are based on Beauchamp and Childress\u2019 four biomedical principles. Other commonly used types are the \u2018moral case deliberations\u2019 by prominent authors such as Widdershoven, Molewijk et al. However, based on our practical work as clinical ethicists, and doctoral students in the field of clinical ethics, we would like to hypothesize that most of the methods seem to be in need of philosophical supplementation, especially on the blind spots regarding the is-ought fallacy, i.e. how to relate empirical data to normative conclusions. A further weakness may be found in the inadequate handling of power structures, which may lead to an unjust handling of opinions. In our talk, we will therefore present Miranda Fricker\u2019s conceptual idea of \u2018epistemic injustice\u2019 and we will apply these insights to clinical cases of our everyday practice. Epistemic injustice is injustice related to knowledge. The concept focuses on exclusion and silencing people in public discourse. This silencing leads to a systematic distortion or misrepresentation of one\u2019s meanings or contributions and/or to an undervaluing of someone\u2019s status in communicative practices. We think that this concept has not been considered in clinical ethics thus far, and we would like to discuss whether ethical case discussions should not help to avoid epistemic injustice. If so, then the case discussion methods of our discipline should be adapted accordingly. \"",

      "abstract": "I use the examples of medical devices, clinical trials and health data, to look at the framing of harm through the language of technological risk and failure. Across the examples, there is little or no suggestion of failure by those formally responsible. Failure is seen as arising when harm becomes refracted through calculative techniques and judgments, and reaches a point where the expectations of safety built into technological framings of regulation are thwarted. Technological framings may marginalise the contribution patients, research participants and others can make to regulation, which may in turn underlie harm and lead to the construction of failure. This marginalisation may amount to epistemic injustice. Epistemic injustice and its link to failure, which has normative weight over and above harm, can present a risk to organisational standing and reputation. This risk can be used to improve the knowledge base to include stakeholder knowledges of harm, and to widen responsibilities and accountabilities. This promises to allow regulation to better anticipate and prevent harm and failure, and improve the efficacy and legitimacy of the health research enterprise.",

Having connected the recognition heuristic with recent work on the hypotheses of embedded, extended, and scaffolded cognition, it argues that the recognition heuristic is best understood as an instance of scaffolded cognition. It considers the double-edged sword of cognitive scaffolding before using Fricker\u2019s (2007) concept of epistemic injustice to characterize the nature and harm of these false inferences, emphasizing the Darfur Inference. Finally, it uses data-mining and an empirical study to show how Gigerenzer\u2019s population estimation task is liable to produce Darfur Inferences. It ends with some speculative remarks on more important Darfur Inferences, and how to avoid them by scaffolding better.",

Regulators and theorists face the urgent task of identifying potential harms and mitigating risks. This article applies Miranda Fricker\u2019s concepts of testimonial and hermeneutical injustice to explore how GenAI exacerbates or creates epistemic injustice from a feminist, epistemic perspective.Through three case studies, we reveal how gender-biased GenAI responses in leadership and workplace contexts reinforce stereotypes, leading to offline injustices. Moreover, we highlight how gender data gaps within the GenAI ecosystem contribute to hermeneutical injustice, marginalizing women\u2019s experiences within collective knowledge resources. These findings demonstrate how GenAI technologies perpetuate both testimonial and hermeneutical injustices.By integrating existing work on epistemology, AI ethics, and feminist theory, we propose a novel framework for understanding the risks and harms of GenAI. We argue that meta-blindness further obscures these gendered issues and their potential solutions. Our analysis not only sheds light on these critical challenges but also offers a pathway toward achieving gender equity within the GenAI landscape.",

Thus, development of student\u2019s ethical leadership involving transformative teaching is in focus. Based on previous research, ethical leadership is focused on self-awareness, character formation and modelling. This focus involves both verbal and bodily expressions. Verbal expressions are reinforced and developed through conceptualization, dilemmas and ethical codes while bodily expressions are reinforced and developed through modelling. In terms of modelling, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s theory of how people\u2019s embodied experiences shape their life worlds provides perspective on opportunities to develop transformative teaching to challenge norms and enable change. Empirical data from a previous phenomenological study on professional ethics in teacher education exemplifies teaching practice related to epistemic justice.",

Using critical discourse analysis, data from the websites of two scholarly communities of practice were analyzed, revealing their innovative approaches to advancing epistemic justice through knowledge practices.

      "abstract": "Cognitive injustice, which nourishes and sustains current political, social and economic injustice, has been at the centre of the knowledge production enterprise since the colonisers embarked on their project of dispossession and plunder. In order to achieve global justice, the quest for epistemic justice needs to be brought to the centre of curriculum discourses. The postcolonial critique of the canonical corpus of Euro-Western knowledge demands a change in our locus of enunciation. We seized this zeitgeist to repaint the education curriculum canvass in science professional teacher development. We leveraged theoretical constructs from Southern theory, by adopting a decolonial epistemic perspective and privileging a dialogic dynamic. Six purposefully selected, practising science teachers, who were registered to study an Honours in Education module, were engaged to generate qualitative data to respond to the following question: How do science teachers leverage indigenous knowledge to address sustainable development goals? Teachers engaged in intercultural dialogue with indigenous knowledge holders to tap into a plurality of different knowledges. The indigenous knowledge holders who participated were interested in sustainable production/cultivation of items they had used in their practice. Teachers developed portfolios of evidence and participated in focus group interviews. They experienced moments of mourning, dreaming, rediscovery and recovery. This resonated with the same categories that were previously identified by Chilisa, as teachers deconstructed and reconstructed curriculum materials collaboratively with indigenous knowledge holders. The findings reveal that the teachers viewed an indigenous understanding of the world as crucial in the achievement of sustainable development goals. The monolithic, hegemonic Euro-Western thinking was decentred but not abandoned. Instead, teachers rendered it one part of the intercultural dialogue. The study demonstrated the potential for transforming the curriculum to become inclusive of Southern voices in the production of valuable, truthful, reliable knowledge about living together sustainably.\u00a0",

First, it discusses the challenges of extending inferences from present brain activity to mental states and from there to future mental states or behaviors. There is a risk of compounded errors when multiple inferential models are applied sequentially; harmful outcomes for minority groups underrepresented in statistical models could result. In addition, predictions based on brain data may create self-fulfilling prophecies, reinforcing neuroessentialist beliefs that undermine personal agency. Second, the paper discusses how concerns related to epistemic injustice might arise when mental states are inferred from brain data. In particular, it asks if it is just to privilege \"objective\" brain-based conclusions over individuals' subjective self-reports. While brain-based evidence could empower some people to prove their claims, it may also exacerbate credibility gaps and social biases. The article concludes that careful, context-specific assessments are essential before brain-based inferences are adopted in socially significant decisions.",

      "abstract": "The development and deployment of machine learning and AI engender 'AI colonialism', a term that conceptually overlaps with 'data colonialism', as a form of injustice. AI colonialism is in need of decolonization for three reasons. Politically, because it enforces digital capitalism's hegemony. Ecologically, as it negatively impacts the environment and intensifies the extraction of natural resources and consumption of energy. Epistemically, since the social systems within which AI is embedded reinforce Western universalism by imposing Western colonial values on the global South when these manifest in the digital realm is a form of digital capitalism. These reasons require a new conceptualization of AI decolonization. First this paper draws from the historical debates on the concepts of colonialism and decolonization. Secondly it retrieves Achille Mbembe's notion of decolonization as disenclosure to argue that the decolonization of AI will have to be the abolishment of political, ecological and epistemic borders erected and reinforced in the phases of its design, production, development of AI in the West and drawing from the knowledge from the global South. In conclusion, it is discussed how conceiving of decolonial AI as form of disenclosure opens up new ways to think about and intervene in colonial instantiations of AI development and deployment, in order to empower 'the wretched of AI', re-ecologise the unsustainable ecologies AI depends on and to counter the colonial power structures unreflective AI deployment risks to reinforce.",

These models are often trained using data scraped from the internet, reflecting the online data landscape at a certain time. Consequently, they may overlook speech acts, knowledge domains, or cultural artifacts underrepre- sented on the web, such as minority languages or art collections. This leads to a new form of digital participation and, conversely, a new type of \u201cDigital Divide\u201d, excluding individuals from global digital knowledge practices and discourses. The exclusion from such \u201cgenerative participation\u201d may not only be morally problematic but also constitute instances of \u201cepistemic injustice\u201d, where knowledge subjects are not recognized due to identity biases, suggesting that acts of generative exclusion can be severe forms of injustice even without intentional discrimination. This paper outlines the concept of digital participation, locates the outputs of generative AI models within it, examines the value of such \u201cgenerative participation\u201d for individuals, and argues that exclusions from it can lead to epistemic injustices, highlighting the structural nature of injustices beyond intentional actions.",

We first show that the authoritarian top-down intergovernmental cooperation, through international organizations (e.g., UNEP) for climate justice, could not overcome environmental issues and crevices so far. We elaborate on four grounds of climate injustice (i.e., teleological origin, axiological origin, formation cause, and social epistemic cause), and explain how the lack of empathy and environmental motivation on a global scale causes the failure of all the authoritarian top-down intergovernmental cooperation. Addressing all these issues requires a new button-up approach to climate peace and justice. Secondly, focusing on the intersection of AI, environmental empathy, and climate justice, we propose a model of Intelligent Environmental Empathy (IEE) for climate peace and justice at the operational level. IEE is empowered by the new power of environmental empathy (as a driver of green obligation for climate justice) and putative decentralized platform of AI (as an operative system against free riders), which Initially, impact citizens and some middle-class decision makers, such as city planners and local administrators, but will eventually affect global decision-makers as well.",

Using perspectives from critical theories on equity and justice to review the recent literature on employing citizen science for the SDGs, we argue that those advocating that citizen science be used for monitoring and fulfilling global sustainability goals should also be attentive to questions of historically inequitable power relations in the production of knowledge, and they should embrace both decolonial perspectives on science as well as a humbler stance on global data monitoring and governance. While we have argued elsewhere that citizen science should be attentive to various forms of exclusion and epistemic injustice, such attentiveness is even more relevant in the context of attempting to globalize citizen science activities. For this, we draw on alternative forms of citizen science, namely citizen social science and tracking science",

Despite great enthusiasm, there are also several challenges with OS. In order to ensure that OS obtains its benefits, these challenges need to be addressed. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to provide an overview of one type of challenge, i.e., epistemological challenges with OS knowledge production, and their ethical implications. Based on a literature review, it (a) reveals factors undermining the envisioned benefits of OS, (b) identifies negative effects on knowledge production, and (c) exposes epistemological challenges with the various phases of the OS process. The main epistemic challenges are related to governance, framing, looping effects, proper data procurement, validation, replication, bias, and polarization. The ethical implications are injustice, reduced benefit (efficiency), increased harm (as a consequence of poor-quality science), deception and manipulation (reduced autonomy), and lack of trustworthiness. Accordingly, to obtain the envisioned benefits of OS, we need to address these epistemological challenges and their ethical implications.",

Four papers and some discussant essays illustrate the ways in which counter-experts cross boundaries to contest knowledge claims, legal institutions, and forms of data in order to resist various forms of injustice. Literature on counter-expertise, socio-technical imaginaries, and epistemic injustice highlights how marginalized groups are prevented from participating in the process of collective imagining. A definition of counter-expertise and a new typology of counter-expertise demonstrate how marginalized groups navigate boundaries to pursue epistemic justice. The four papers in the special issue exemplify the ways in which counter-experts navigate identity politics. To combat epistemic injustice within our field, STS scholars can be more inclusive with teaching, mentoring, reviewing and other forms of scholarly gatekeeping.",

By employing Gaile Pohlhaus\u2019s theoretical framework, the paper establishes criteria that classify data mining as a form of epistemic injustice (P1) and demonstrates its differentiation from other known forms in existing literature (P2). Through a comprehensive analysis of data mining\u2019s alignment with these criteria, the article highlights its unique nature and draws attention to its previously overlooked manifestation of epistemic injustice. By comparing data mining to established forms of epistemic injustice, this research underscores the urgent need for a critical examination of this ethical dilemma arising from technological advancements.",

This book offers a systematic account of epistemic power and agency by turning to the dynamics of epistemic injustice\u2014that is, the many forms epistemic injustice can take, the different sites and mechanisms through which it operates, and the various transformations consequently required to cultivate greater epistemic justice. Adopting standpoint theory both as a theory and as a methodology, the book focuses on several pressing social questions, such as deliberative impasses in divided societies, colonial memory, academic migration, the underrepresentation of members of non-dominant groups in certain fields, and the marginalization of minoritized minds, such as intellectually disabled people and Autistics. By analyzing these social questions through the lens of the dynamics of epistemic injustice, the book develops a systematic account of epistemic power and agency.",

Insofar as the processes and procedures that constitute research oversight are meant to ensure the ethical conduct of research, they are based on ideas or beliefs about what ethical research entails and about which processes will ensure the ethical conduct of research. These ideas and beliefs make up an epistemic infrastructure underlying Canada's system of research ethics governance, but, we argue, extensive efforts by community members to fill gaps in that system suggest that these ideas may be deficient. Our aim is to make these deficiencies explicit through critical analysis by briefly introducing the philosophical literature on epistemic injustice and ignorance, and by drawing on this literature and empirical evidence to examine how injustice and ignorance show up across three levels of research ethics governance: research ethics boards, regulations, and training. Following this critique, and drawing on insights from the same philosophical tradition, we highlight the work that communities across Canada have done to rewrite and rework how research ethics as a site of epistemic resistance is practiced.",

      "abstract": "The research field of epistemic justice in healthcare has gained traction in the last decade. However, the importation of Miranda Fricker\u2019s original philosophical framework to medicine raises several interrelated issues that have largely escaped attention. Instead of pushing forward, crafting new concepts or exploring other medical conditions, we suggest that it is time to take stock, reconsider, and articulate some fundamental issues that confront the field of epistemic injustice in healthcare. This paper articulates such fundamental issues, which we divide into scientific, conceptual, and theoretical issues. Scientifically, the research field is confronted by a lack of empirical evidence. It relies on cases, making generalizations impossible and the field vulnerable to bias. Conceptually, many of the claims advanced in the literature are presented as facts but are merely hypotheses to be tested. Moreover, a criterion for applying the concept of testimonial injustice in medicine is lacking, impeding the development of a construct to empirically measure said injustices. Theoretically, many of the cases discussed in the literature do not prima facie qualify as cases of testimonial injustice, since they lack necessary components of testimonial injustice in Fricker\u2019s framework, i.e., being unintentional and caused by identity prejudices in the hearers. If epistemic injustice is as pervasive as it is claimed in this literature, it should be of concern to us all. Addressing the issues raised here may strengthen the conceptualization of epistemic injustice in healthcare and lead to development of constructs that finally can explore its empirical basis.",

      "abstract": "Epistemic injustice related to AI is a growing concern. In relation to machine learning models, epistemic injustice can have a diverse range of sources, ranging from epistemic opacity, the discriminatory automation of testimonial prejudice, and the distortion of human beliefs via generative AI\u2019s hallucinations to the exclusion of the global South in global AI governance, the execution of bureaucratic violence via algorithmic systems, and interactions with conversational artificial agents. Based on a proposed general taxonomy of epistemic injustice, this paper first sketches a taxonomy of the types of epistemic injustice in the context of AI, relying on the work of scholars from the fields of philosophy of technology, political philosophy and social epistemology. Secondly, an additional conceptualization on epistemic injustice in the context of AI is provided: generative hermeneutical erasure. I argue that this injustice the automation of \u2018epistemicide\u2019, the injustice done to epistemic agents in their capacity for collective sense-making through the suppression of difference in epistemology and conceptualization by LLMs. AI systems\u2019 \u2018view from nowhere\u2019 epistemically inferiorizes non-Western epistemologies and thereby contributes to the erosion of their epistemic particulars, gradually contributing to hermeneutical erasure. This work\u2019s relevance lies in proposal of a taxonomy that allows epistemic injustices to be mapped in the AI domain and the proposal of a novel form of AI-related epistemic injustice.",

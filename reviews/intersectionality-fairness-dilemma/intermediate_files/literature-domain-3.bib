DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses fundamental questions about the nature and constitution of social groups. The central debate concerns whether social groups can be identified algorithmically through attributes (combinatorial/attribute-based accounts) or whether they must be specified through social practices, recognition, and hermeneutic processes (practice-based accounts). Attribute-based accounts, exemplified by certain computational approaches to fairness, assume groups are defined by shared observable features that can be combined mechanically. Practice-based accounts, developed by philosophers like Haslanger, Mallon, and Ásta, argue that social groups are constituted through norms, collective intentionality, social roles, and conferral mechanisms that cannot be reduced to demographic attributes.

Recent work has increasingly emphasized the role of social structures, power relations, and institutional practices in constituting social kinds. Haslanger's influential work argues that race and gender are social positions defined by systematic subordination or privilege, challenging both biological essentialism and simple attribute-based models. Mallon develops a homeostatic property cluster account showing how social roles create stable but contingent patterns. Ásta's conferralist framework demonstrates how social properties depend on communal meaning-making rather than intrinsic features. Ritchie's structuralist ontology centers social groups on networks of social relations. These accounts converge on the view that group membership is not merely a matter of possessing certain attributes, but involves positioning within social structures and participation in practices that are historically contingent and politically contested.

This literature reveals deep ontological uncertainty about how to identify "the right groups" for normative purposes like fairness auditing. The disagreement is not merely terminological but reflects fundamental differences about whether social reality has a structure that can be discovered algorithmically or whether it must be interpreted through situated understanding of practices and power relations.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is critical for the intersectionality fairness project because it exposes the ontological assumptions underlying different approaches to specifying protected groups. If practice-based accounts are correct, then algorithmic approaches that derive groups from attributes may systematically misidentify morally relevant social categories. The debate between attribute-based and practice-based accounts directly parallels the tension in ML fairness between combinatorial group definitions and substantive understandings of social groups as constituted by oppression.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive philosophical work on social construction and the metaphysics of social kinds, there is limited engagement with how these debates bear on algorithmic group specification. Few papers directly address the question of whether computational methods can adequately capture the practice-based constitution of social groups, or whether ontological pluralism about social groups creates fundamental indeterminacy for fairness metrics.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the fundamental contrast between attribute-based and practice-based accounts of group constitution, showing how this philosophical debate undermines the assumption that there is a determinate set of groups for intersectional fairness auditing. Key papers (Haslanger, Mallon, Ásta, Ritchie) should be used to articulate different models of social construction and their implications for algorithmic specification of groups.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Haslanger-style political constructionism: 8 papers - Groups defined by structural positions of subordination/privilege
- Social role/HPC kinds (Mallon): 3 papers - Groups stabilized by homeostatic mechanisms of social roles
- Conferralism (Ásta): 2 papers - Groups constituted by communal conferral of properties
- Structuralism (Ritchie): 2 papers - Groups as social structures, networks of relations

  title = {Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Haslanger defends a realist social constructionist account of race and gender as social positions constituted by systematic relations of subordination and privilege. She argues that race and gender are real social kinds, not natural kinds, defined by one's social position within hierarchical structures rather than by biological or intrinsic properties. The book develops an ameliorative analysis that seeks to identify what race and gender ought to mean for purposes of feminist and antiracist critique, rather than simply capturing ordinary usage.

  RELEVANCE: This work is foundational for understanding practice-based accounts of social group constitution that challenge attribute-based models. Haslanger's political constructionism shows that social groups cannot be adequately specified through demographic attributes alone, since group membership is fundamentally about structural positioning within power relations. Her account directly undermines the assumption that algorithmic fairness systems can identify relevant groups by mechanically combining observable features, since the morally salient aspect of group membership (systematic subordination or privilege) is not reducible to intrinsic attributes but depends on social structures and practices. This poses a fundamental challenge to intersectional fairness approaches that treat groups as attribute-defined categories.

  POSITION: Political constructionism about social kinds - groups defined by structural positions within hierarchical social relations.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755678.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mallon develops a sophisticated account of how human social kinds (race, gender, sexuality) are constructed through social roles that create homeostatic property clusters (HPC kinds). He argues that while these categories are socially constructed, they can nevertheless be real, stable, and explanatorily useful because social roles create systematic patterns of correlated properties through mechanisms like stereotype threat, discrimination, and social norms. The book distinguishes between "covert" social constructions (where people falsely believe the kind is natural) and "overt" ones, showing how social construction is compatible with scientific realism about human kinds.

  RELEVANCE: Mallon's HPC account provides a middle ground between pure attribute-based and pure practice-based views, showing how social practices generate stable correlations between properties. However, his account also reveals the contingency and instability of these correlations - social roles can change, categories can shift, and what counts as a relevant group depends on specific social-historical contexts. For intersectional fairness, this means that even if we can identify statistical patterns that correspond to social groups, these patterns are artifacts of contingent social practices rather than natural divisions, and the "right" groups cannot be read off from demographic data without understanding the social mechanisms that produce group-differentiated outcomes. The distinction between covert and overt construction is particularly relevant for understanding why algorithmic systems may reify problematic social categories.

@book{asta2018categories,

  year = {2018},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  isbn = {978-0-19-025679-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ásta develops a conferralist framework for understanding social categories, arguing that individuals possess social properties (like gender, race, sexuality) in virtue of communal conferral rather than intrinsic features. On this view, social categories are constituted through practices of meaning-making where communities collectively confer properties onto individuals based on contextually salient features. This is fundamentally different from attribute-based accounts because the same constellation of attributes can ground different social properties in different contexts, and the conferral can be mistaken or contested. The framework emphasizes that social categories are both real and constructed through human practices of categorization.

  RELEVANCE: Ásta's conferralism directly challenges algorithmic approaches to group specification by showing that social categories cannot be derived from attributes alone, since the same attributes can be conferrally salient in different ways depending on context and community practices. For intersectional fairness, this implies that there is no algorithm-independent fact about which combinations of attributes constitute morally relevant groups - what matters is how communities confer meaning onto those combinations through situated practices. This creates fundamental indeterminacy for fairness systems that attempt to pre-specify groups based on demographic features, since the normatively relevant categories depend on interpretive practices that vary across contexts. The framework supports a practice-based rather than attribute-based approach to identifying protected groups.

@article{ritchie2018social,

  number = {3},
  pages = {6 29--655},
  doi = {10.1111/phpr.12555},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ritchie develops a structuralist ontology of social groups centered on social structures - networks of relations that are constitutively dependent on social factors. On this view, social groups are not mere collections of individuals who share attributes, but rather structures consisting of nodes (individuals) connected by social relations (asymmetric, contextual, and socially mediated). This account accommodates diverse types of groups (gender groups, racial groups, teams, committees) while maintaining ontological distinctions between them based on the kinds of relations that constitute their structure. Crucially, the account explains why not every arbitrary collection of people counts as a social group.

  RELEVANCE: Ritchie's structuralism provides a sophisticated alternative to attribute-based group definitions that is particularly relevant for intersectional fairness. If social groups are constituted by networks of relations rather than shared attributes, then algorithmic approaches that identify groups through demographic feature combinations fundamentally misconstrue the ontology of social groups. The relational structure of a group cannot be captured by listing attributes its members possess, since what makes a collection a group is the pattern of relations between members, not just their individual properties. For ML fairness, this suggests that protected groups may not be identifiable through combinatorial methods applied to demographic features, since group membership depends on relational positioning that is not reducible to individual attributes. This creates a deep challenge for attribute-based fairness metrics.

  POSITION: Structural ontology - groups as networks of socially constituted relations, not collections defined by shared attributes.

@article{thomasson2019ontology,

  title = {The Ontology of Social Groups},
  journal = {Synthese},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {196},
  number = {12},
  pages = {4829--4845},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-016-1185-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Thomasson argues that questions about whether social groups exist have easy answers - they obviously do - but that the more interesting question is "What are social groups?" She critiques the assumption that there is a unified category "social group" that forms a natural kind subject to metaphysical inquiry, suggesting instead that we should pluralism about types of social groups. Different groups (teams, gender groups, racial groups, nations) may have different ontological structures. The paper emphasizes moving beyond existence questions to substantive questions about the variety and differences among social groups.

  RELEVANCE: Thomasson's ontological pluralism about social groups has direct implications for intersectional fairness. If there is no unified account of what social groups are, but rather a variety of different kinds of groups with different constitution conditions, then there cannot be a single algorithmic method for identifying all relevant groups. Different types of groups (gender groups, racial groups, disability groups) may require different approaches to specification. This pluralism creates indeterminacy for fairness frameworks that assume a uniform method for deriving protected groups from demographic attributes. The paper supports the view that ontological uncertainty about social groups is ineliminable, not merely a problem of insufficient philosophical analysis.

  POSITION: Ontological pluralism - different types of social groups may have fundamentally different metaphysical structures.

  pages = {93--108},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00051.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This influential survey distinguishes different varieties of social construction claims and maps the conceptual territory. Mallon identifies causal, constitutive, and representational forms of social construction, showing how claims that X is socially constructed can mean different things in different contexts. He clarifies what makes construction claims interesting (typically contingency, controlability, or debunking implications) and distinguishes social construction from related concepts like conventionality and cultural variability. The paper provides analytical tools for evaluating constructionist arguments and identifies common fallacies.

  RELEVANCE: This conceptual taxonomy is valuable for understanding exactly what is at stake in debates about whether social groups are socially constructed. For intersectional fairness, the distinction between causal and constitutive construction matters: if groups are causally constructed (social practices create property correlations) this suggests attribute-based identification may work; if groups are constitutively constructed (social practices constitute what it is to be a member), then attributes alone cannot capture group membership. The paper's framework helps clarify that the challenge to algorithmic group specification is not merely that groups are socially constructed, but specifically that they are constitutively (not just causally) constructed through practices that cannot be reduced to attribute possession.

@book{epstein2015ant,
  author = {Epstein, Brian},
  title = {The Ant Trap: Rebuilding the Foundations of the Social Sciences},
  year = {2015},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199381104.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Epstein develops a framework distinguishing "grounding" (what makes social facts obtain) from "anchoring" (what sets the grounding conditions in place). He argues that social ontology requires explaining both aspects, and that dominant individualist approaches fail to explain anchoring. The book develops a sophisticated model for understanding how social facts depend on both individual-level facts and frame-setting social facts (rules, norms, conventions). This framework is applied to analyze groups, institutions, and collective intentionality, showing how social facts can be real without being reducible to individual-level facts.

  RELEVANCE: Epstein's grounding/anchoring distinction is valuable for understanding why attribute-based group specification may fail. Even if certain demographic attributes ground group membership in specific contexts, what anchors those grounding conditions (why those attributes matter for that group) depends on social-historical facts about institutions, practices, and norms that cannot be discovered algorithmically from the data. For intersectional fairness, this suggests that specifying groups requires not just identifying current property correlations (grounding) but understanding the frame-setting facts (anchoring) that make certain attributes relevant for group membership. Algorithmic approaches that work from demographic data alone cannot access anchoring facts, creating fundamental limitations on computational group specification.

  doi = {10.1017/9781009290562},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This recent overview of social ontology provides a systematic map of the field, distinguishing theories of social construction from theories that characterize products of social construction. Epstein uses running examples (property/ownership, race, collective attitudes) to illustrate different theoretical approaches and their implications. The element emphasizes that social ontology addresses not just what social facts are, but what makes them social facts and how they relate to non-social facts. It provides a taxonomy of major theoretical approaches and identifies key open questions in the field.

  RELEVANCE: As a recent, authoritative survey, this element is valuable for understanding the current state of debates about social ontology that bear on intersectional fairness. The systematic treatment of different approaches to understanding race and social groups helps situate specific arguments from Haslanger, Mallon, and others within broader theoretical frameworks. For the fairness project, the element's emphasis on distinguishing "what are the products of social construction" from "how are they constructed" maps onto the distinction between identifying which groups exist and explaining how group boundaries are determined - both of which create challenges for algorithmic group specification.

  year = {1996},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  isbn = {978-0-691-02661-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Appiah's influential essay "Race, Culture, Identity: Misunderstood Connections" argues that races, in the biological essentialist sense that  has historically dominated racial thinking, do not exist. However, racial identities are socially real as sources of collective identity and solidarity. He distinguishes "racial identity" (a socially constructed group membership) from outdated biological notions of race, while acknowledging the political and personal significance of racial identification. Appiah emphasizes the complexity of racial identity, arguing against both biological essentialism and simple social construction views that ignore how race shapes lived experience.

  RELEVANCE: Appiah's account of race as both non-biological and socially real is relevant for understanding why algorithmic systems that treat race as a simple demographic attribute may fail. If racial categories are constituted through complex processes of identification, recognition, and meaning-making rather than biological facts, then computational approaches that operationalize race through check-boxes may systematically mischaracterize the phenomenon. For intersectional fairness, this suggests that standard demographic categories used in ML systems may not track the normatively relevant social groups, since they abstract away from the interpretive and identificatory dimensions that constitute racial identity. The gap between census categories and lived racial identity creates ontological uncertainty about which groups matter for fairness.

  POSITION: Anti-biological-essentialism combined with recognition of social reality and political significance of racial identity.

  number = {2},
  pages = {393--409},
  doi = {10.1111/phpr.12376},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Griffith develops a ground-theoretic account of social construction, arguing that facts are socially constructed when they are grounded in (depend on) social facts. He distinguishes this from causal accounts and from constitutive accounts that rely on older notions of constitution. The paper argues that metaphysical grounding provides the right framework for understanding constructionist claims, allowing us to distinguish what is fundamental from what is derivative in the social world. Griffith defends this approach against objections and shows how it applies to paradigm cases like gender and race.

  RELEVANCE: The grounding-theoretic framework helps clarify what is at stake when we say social groups are constructed. If group membership facts are grounded in (metaphysically depend on) social-structural facts rather than intrinsic individual attributes, then algorithmic approaches that work from individual-level demographic features to group membership reverse the order of metaphysical dependence. This suggests a fundamental mismatch between the ontology of social groups and computational methods that treat groups as defined by attribute combinations. For fairness, understanding the grounding structure of social groups matters for identifying which features are truly constitutive of group membership versus merely correlated with it.

@article{haslanger2005talking,

  journal = {Hypatia},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {20},
  number = {4},
  pages = {10--26},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1527-2001.2005.tb00533.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Haslanger addresses the methodology of analyzing social kinds, defending an "ameliorative" approach that asks what concepts of race, gender, etc. would be most useful for feminist and antiracist purposes, rather than simply describing ordinary usage. She argues that ordinary concepts of social kinds may themselves be ideological, obscuring relations of power and subordination. The ameliorative analysis of gender as "women are those systematically subordinated on the basis of observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of reproductive capacities" captures what matters for feminist critique while potentially diverging from folk concepts.

  RELEVANCE: Haslanger's ameliorative methodology is directly relevant to debates about which groups matter for fairness analysis. If the point of identifying groups is normative (to address injustice), then the relevant groups may not be those defined by common usage or demographic conventions, but those that track structural positions of subordination and privilege. This challenges algorithmic fairness approaches that operationalize groups through standard demographic categories, since those categories may not capture the normatively salient divisions. The paper suggests that there may be no purely descriptive, politically neutral way to specify which groups matter for fairness - group specification is inevitably a normative and political question.

  POSITION: Ameliorative analysis - concepts of social kinds should be evaluated for their usefulness in critique, not just descriptive accuracy.

  pages = {362--375},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315112596-24},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This handbook chapter surveys key questions and approaches in social ontology, arguing that social entities deserve serious metaphysical attention despite being historically excluded from mainstream metaphysics. The authors examine whether the exclusion of social entities is philosophically warranted or reflects historical bias, concluding that social metaphysics should be central to metaphysical inquiry. They argue that taking social entities seriously may lead us to rethink core metaphysical assumptions about preferring intrinsic over relational properties, and independent over dependent features.

  RELEVANCE: The argument that social entities require metaphysical frameworks different from those developed for natural entities is relevant for understanding why computational approaches developed for physical systems may not transfer to social domains. If social groups are fundamentally relational, dependent, and non-individualistic (as the authors argue), then methods that assume groups can be defined through intrinsic individual properties will systematically fail. For intersectional fairness, this suggests that standard approaches to operationalizing protected groups through demographic attributes may rest on inappropriate metaphysical assumptions imported from non-social domains.

  number = {4},
  pages = {1137--1152},
  doi = {10.1111/ejop.12033},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Díaz-León provides a systematic analysis of what it means to say something is socially constructed, distinguishing several different types of construction claims with different philosophical and political implications. She clarifies the distinction between claims about the etiology of a feature (how it came to be), claims about its modal status (that it could have been otherwise), and claims about its dependency (that it depends on social factors for its continued existence). The paper shows how different construction claims support different normative conclusions about changeability and responsibility.

  RELEVANCE: This analytical work helps clarify exactly what is at stake when we say social groups are constructed. For intersectional fairness, different notions of social construction have different implications. If groups are constructed in the sense of being contingent and changeable, this suggests their boundaries are not fixed algorithmic targets. If they are constructed in the sense of depending on ongoing social practices, this means group membership cannot be determined solely from static demographic data. The paper's taxonomy helps identify which varieties of social construction pose challenges for computational group specification.

  number = {2},
  pages = {890--902},
  doi = {10.1017/S0003055423000679},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Popescu-Sarry develops a constructionist account of discrimination arguing that understanding grounds of discrimination (race, gender, etc.) as socially constructed reveals discrimination to be not a discrete event but an ongoing process of (re)negotiating social reality. She argues that standard theories of discrimination that take protected characteristics as given fail to account for how discrimination itself constitutes and reconstitutes those very characteristics. The paper shows how a constructionist view reveals discrimination as fundamentally political, involving struggles over how social reality is constructed.

  RELEVANCE: This recent work directly connects social construction debates to discrimination and fairness, making it highly relevant for intersectional fairness. If discrimination is not applied to pre-existing groups but rather constitutes groups through the very process of differential treatment, then algorithmic fairness systems that take groups as pre-specified inputs may fundamentally misunderstand the phenomenon. The paper suggests that fairness frameworks cannot avoid engaging with the politics of how groups are constructed, since specifying protected groups is itself a site of political contest. This creates deep challenges for technical approaches that assume group boundaries are determinate inputs rather than contested political constructions.

  volume = {90},
  number = {1},
  pages = {96--112},
  doi = {10.1111/phpr.12020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Khalidi distinguishes three types of social kinds based on their dependence relations to human attitudes. Type 1 social kinds exist independently of human attitudes toward them (e.g., economic recessions); Type 2 depend on general attitudes but not attitudes toward particular instances (e.g., money); Type 3 depend on attitudes toward their particular instances (e.g., celebrities). This taxonomy cuts across standard distinctions and shows that social kinds are metaphysically heterogeneous. Different types of social kinds have different stability conditions and different relationships to human practices of categorization.

  RELEVANCE: Khalidi's taxonomy suggests that different protected groups in fairness contexts may be different types of social kinds, requiring different approaches to specification. Gender and race might be Type 3 kinds (where someone's membership depends partly on how they are regarded), while socioeconomic status might be Type 1 (less dependent on attitudes). This heterogeneity creates challenges for uniform algorithmic approaches to identifying protected groups, since different groups may have fundamentally different constitution conditions. The paper supports ontological pluralism about social groups that undermines one-size-fits-all specification methods.

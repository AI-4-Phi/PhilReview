DOMAIN: Critique of Modernity and the "Myth of Modernity"
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-20
PAPERS_FOUND: 17 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers secondary literature analyzing Dussel's critique of the
dominant Eurocentric narrative of modernity. Key debates center on Dussel's
1492 periodization (vs. intra-European origins), his concept of the "myth of
modernity" as a justification for colonial violence, and his proposal of
"transmodernity" as a decolonial alternative. The literature includes
critical engagements with Dussel's critiques of Habermas and Hegel, feminist
readings of his theory of rationality and indigenous peoples, and recent
work on transmodernity's relationship to decolonial theory. Spanish-language
scholarship is particularly strong, with journals like Cuadernos de Filosofía
Latinoamericana and Ideas y Valores publishing sustained analyses of Dussel's
historiography and anti-Eurocentric method.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Dussel's myth of modernity thesis directly addresses how Eurocentrism
structures philosophical accounts of reason, progress, and universality. His
critique of the "developmental fallacy" and his emphasis on 1492 as the
origin of both modernity and its "dark side" (colonialism) provide a
framework for understanding how philosophical narratives exclude non-European
perspectives.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited English-language scholarship on Dussel's Habermas critique compared
to Spanish sources. Few comparative studies of Dussel with other decolonial
thinkers (Mignolo, Quijano) on the specific question of modernity's
periodization. No major book-length studies in English specifically on
Dussel's myth of modernity thesis since Alcoff & Mendieta (2000).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around three axes: (1) periodization debates (1492 vs. intra-European
origins), (2) the myth/rationality dialectic (how modernity's self-image as
emancipatory conceals sacrificial violence), (3) transmodernity as alternative
(pluriversal vs. universal modernity).

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Sympathetic engagement: 10 papers - Scholars extending/applying Dussel's
  framework (Grosfoguel, Deere, Lozano Suárez, Camelo)
- Critical evaluation: 5 papers - Feminist critiques (Lange), comparisons with
  European critical theory (Dallmayr), debates over universality (Pachón Soto)
- Expository/historical: 2 papers - Intellectual histories of Dussel's concept
  development (Pimenta)

DOMAIN: Ethics of Liberation and Eurocentrism
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-20
PAPERS_FOUND: 22 total (High: 10, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, Brave
LANGUAGE_BREAKDOWN: English: 14, Spanish: 7, Portuguese: 1
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines Dussel's ethics of liberation as a diagnosis of and response to Eurocentrism in moral philosophy. The core debate concerns how Dussel critiques universalist ethics (particularly Kantian and discourse ethics developed by Apel and Habermas) as Eurocentric while simultaneously defending a non-relativist ethics grounded in the material principle of life and the appeals of victims. Key positions include: (1) defenders of Dussel's material ethics as genuinely universal but grounded in exclusion rather than abstract consensus (Zúñiga, Fóscolo), (2) critics who argue that Dussel's ethics remains incompatible with his own formal-procedural criteria (Sørensen, Quintana Paz), and (3) interpreters who emphasize Dussel's appropriation of Levinas's concept of exteriority to diagnose the ethical violence of totality-thinking in European philosophy (Barber, Maldonado-Torres). Recent scholarship highlights the decade-long Dussel-Apel debate over whether material or formal ethics has priority, and whether victims excluded from discourse can ground ethical critique.

The literature reveals Dussel's ethics as fundamentally structured by the concept of "the Other" as exteriority—those excluded from existing systems who appeal from beyond (exterioridad). This concept draws on Levinas but transforms it into a material-historical category: victims of colonialism, poverty, and exclusion. Dussel argues that Habermasian discourse ethics presupposes participants who are already included, thereby rendering invisible those denied access to communication. His material principle—"produce, reproduce, and develop human life"—provides an evaluative standpoint grounded in corporeal vulnerability rather than formal consensus.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain directly addresses how Dussel diagnoses Eurocentrism within ethical theory itself. His critique targets not only the historical biases of European thinkers but the structural exclusions built into supposedly universal ethical frameworks. The debate with Apel and Habermas reveals how Dussel's concept of exteriority functions as an epistemological and ethical critique of center-periphery thinking—victims know what participants in dominant discourse cannot know. This connects to the broader project's investigation of how Dussel's account of Eurocentrism operates across epistemology, ethics, and history.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Limited English-language engagement with Dussel's five-volume Para una ética de la liberación latinoamericana (1973-1980), which contains his early development of the exteriority concept. Few studies compare Dussel's ethics to other postcolonial ethical frameworks (Fanon, Spivak, Mbembe). Minimal treatment of how Dussel's later Political Ethics trilogy (2006-2009) revises or extends the ethics of liberation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesis should emphasize the materialist turn in Dussel's critique of discourse ethics—his argument that formal-procedural ethics presupposes material conditions that exclude victims. The debate with Apel is central but should be framed within Dussel's broader diagnosis of how European ethics operates with an implicit geography (center-periphery). Compare Dussel's concept of "the victim" to Levinas's "the Other" to show both continuity and transformation. Consider whether Dussel's ethics escapes the relativism charge or redefines universality.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dusselian material ethics: 8 papers - Dussel's material principle of life grounds ethical critique in corporeal vulnerability and exclusion, providing a universal but non-Eurocentric foundation
- Critique of discourse ethics: 6 papers - Dussel's argument that Apel/Habermas presuppose inclusion and cannot account for victims outside the community of communication
- Levinasian exteriority: 4 papers - Dussel's appropriation and transformation of Levinas's concept of the Other as ethical exteriority into a material-historical category
- Critical responses: 4 papers - Arguments that Dussel's ethics contains internal contradictions or fails to escape Eurocentric frameworks

DOMAIN: Epistemology, Philosophy of Liberation, and Geopolitics of Knowledge
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-20
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 8, Medium: 7)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines Dussel's epistemological critique of Eurocentrism, focusing on the geopolitics of knowledge production, epistemic privilege of the oppressed, and connections to broader decolonial epistemology. The literature reveals three main debates. First, the relationship between epistemic location and knowledge validity: Dussel argues that knowledge is geopolitically situated, and dominant "Western" epistemology masks its own particularity by claiming universality. Second, critical engagement with Dussel's epistemological claims: scholars like Chambers (2020) and Irvine (2010) challenge whether Dussel's critique leads to problematic relativism or whether his "analectic" method genuinely transcends European frameworks. Third, feminist and intersectional critiques of early decolonial theory: Mendoza & Grijalva (2022) argue that Dussel and Quijano inadequately theorize gender and coloniality, revealing blind spots in the decolonial knowledge project itself.

The Spanish-language scholarship (Retamozo 2017, 2022) addresses methodological questions often neglected in Anglophone reception: how does philosophy of liberation ground critical social sciences? What criteria of truth and objectivity apply? Recent work (Timmenga et al. 2025) defends Dussel's rationalism against postmodern critiques, arguing that epistemic decolonization requires balancing critique with universalist commitments to avoid both dogmatism and skepticism.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

Dussel's epistemology is central to his Eurocentrism critique because it exposes how Eurocentric philosophy naturalizes a particular geopolitical location (Europe) as the site of universal reason. This domain connects to the broader project by showing how Dussel's epistemological arguments underpin his historical and ethical critiques: if knowledge is geopolitically conditioned, then the "myth of modernity" is not just historically false but epistemologically suspect. The literature also reveals tensions within decolonial thought—between universalism and particularism, between critique and alterity—that bear directly on evaluating Dussel's account.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Limited engagement with Dussel's use of dependency theory and world-systems analysis in epistemological context (most focus on ethics/politics). Insufficient Spanish-language work translated into English. Few studies explicitly connect Dussel's epistemology to contemporary debates in standpoint theory or social epistemology (despite conceptual overlap). The relationship between Dussel's epistemology and Mignolo's "border thinking" remains under-theorized in the secondary literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Highlight the critical/sympathetic divide: Chambers and Irvine represent philosophical objections to Dussel's epistemology (relativism, Eurocentric method), while Timmenga, Retamozo, and Mendoza/Grijalva extend or refine decolonial epistemology from within. Stone-Mediatore provides applied case study of epistemic colonialism in global ethics discourse. The synthesis should clarify whether Dussel's epistemology is defensible on its own terms or requires substantial revision.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Critical analytic perspective (Chambers, Irvine): 5 papers - Dussel's epistemology leads to relativism or fails to escape European frameworks
- Sympathetic extension (Retamozo, Timmenga, Mendoza/Grijalva): 6 papers - Dussel's epistemology can be refined and applied to social sciences, feminist theory
- Applied/case studies (Stone-Mediatore, Linhart, Hoagland): 4 papers - Demonstrate epistemic colonialism in specific domains (global ethics, science studies)

DOMAIN: Political Philosophy, Democracy, and Transmodernity
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-20
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain covers Dussel's political philosophy as articulated in his major
works Política de la liberación (2007, 2009) and 20 Tesis de política (2006).
The collected scholarship examines three interrelated themes: (1) Dussel's
critique of liberal democracy and the social contract tradition as Eurocentric
formations that obscure the constituent power of the people, (2) his central
distinction between potentia (the constituent power of the community, which
he terms "hyperpotentia" or poder popular) and potestas (institutionalized
power that risks fetishization), and (3) his concept of transmodernity as a
political project that moves beyond both modernity and postmodernity by
affirming the cultural resources of colonized peoples.

The literature reveals several key debates. First, scholars examine how
Dussel's concept of "obediential power" (poder obediencial) challenges both
liberal representative democracy and Schmittian decisionism by grounding
political legitimacy in the ongoing will of the people rather than in
constitutional origins or sovereign exception. Second, there is extensive
engagement with Dussel's appropriation of Marx's critique of commodity
fetishism to theorize the "fetishism of power" whereby institutionalized
political structures become autonomous from popular will. Third, researchers
explore Dussel's dialogue with European political theorists (Schmitt, Agamben,
Ricœur, Apel) to assess whether his politics of liberation successfully
decolonizes political philosophy or remains within a modified European
framework. Finally, recent work examines transmodernity not merely as a
theoretical concept but as a method for analyzing concrete political movements
in Latin America and the Global South.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

These sources are essential for understanding how Dussel's critique of
Eurocentrism operates at the level of political ontology and institutional
analysis, not merely as a geopolitical or historical claim. His distinction
between potentia and potestas provides a conceptual framework for identifying
how European political thought systematically privileges constituted power
over constituent power, thereby delegitimizing non-European forms of political
organization. The literature on transmodernity is particularly relevant for
assessing whether Dussel offers a viable alternative to both Eurocentric
modernity and the postmodern turn.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

While there is substantial Spanish-language scholarship on Dussel's political
concepts, English-language engagement with specific dimensions of his political
philosophy remains limited. Few papers examine his treatment of Latin American
popular movements (Zapatismo, pink tide governments) as instantiations of his
political theory. There is also limited critical engagement from liberal
democratic theorists who might challenge Dussel's characterization of
representation as inherently fetishistic.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

The synthesis should organize papers according to conceptual clusters rather
than chronology: (1) political theology and critique of sovereignty, (2) the
potentia/potestas distinction and fetishism of power, (3) transmodernity as
political project, (4) critical dialogues with European theorists. Spanish-
language sources provide the most detailed exegesis of Dussel's political
concepts, while English-language sources tend to be more comparative and
critical. The synthesis should attend to both sympathetic reconstructions and
critical assessments from Marxist, liberal, and postcolonial perspectives.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Political theology: 3 papers - Dussel's liberationist political theology as alternative to Schmitt/Agamben
- Potentia/potestas: 5 papers - Core political ontology and critique of fetishized power
- Transmodernity: 4 papers - Decolonial political project beyond modernity/postmodernity
- Critical dialogue: 6 papers - Engagement with Ricœur, Dewey, Apel, Castro-Gómez

DOMAIN: Universalism, Particularity, and Intercultural Dialogue
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-21
PAPERS_FOUND: 12 total (High: 5, Medium: 5, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines Dussel's responses to charges of relativism and his proposals for analogical or pluriversal universality. The central debate revolves around how Dussel navigates between abstract Eurocentric universalism and cultural relativism through concepts like transmodernity, interculturality, and pluriversality. Key works include Dussel's foundational article "Transmodernidade e interculturalidade" (2016) and the critical dialogue between Dussel and Karl-Otto Apel on discourse ethics. The domain encompasses three main clusters: (1) Dussel's positive proposal for transmodern intercultural dialogue as an alternative to both modern universalism and postmodern relativism; (2) the Dussel-Apel debate on grounding universal ethics while respecting cultural particularity; and (3) secondary literature analyzing pluriversality, analogical universality, and concrete universality in Latin American philosophy. Recent scholarship (2019-2025) shows growing interest in interculturality as critical decolonial praxis and the application of Dusselian frameworks to contemporary global challenges.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Understanding Dussel's account of Eurocentrism requires grappling with his alternative universalism. Dussel's critique of European modernity is not a rejection of universality per se, but rather a rejection of abstract, ahistorical universalism that masks particular European interests as universal human values. His concepts of transmodernity and pluriversality offer a path beyond the universalism-relativism binary that is central to assessing whether his critique succeeds philosophically.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is substantial literature on Dussel's intercultural philosophy and the Dussel-Apel debate, there are fewer works analyzing the specific mechanisms by which analogical universality avoids both abstract universalism and relativism. The relationship between Dussel's pluriversality and other decolonial concepts (e.g., Mignolo's border thinking, Walsh's critical interculturality) deserves more systematic treatment. Additionally, critical evaluations of whether Dussel's transmodern project successfully escapes Eurocentrism remain underdeveloped. Nine of twelve entries lack abstracts due to limited indexing of specialized philosophy sources.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the structure of Dussel's argument: he rejects European universalism as abstract and ideological while proposing an alternative "concrete" or "analogical" universality grounded in intercultural dialogue among the excluded. The Dussel-Apel debate provides crucial context for understanding how Dussel appropriates and transforms discourse ethics. Pay attention to the distinction between transmodernity (Dussel's concept) and postmodernity, as this distinction is often misunderstood.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dussel's transmodern interculturality (5 papers): Argues for intercultural dialogue as the basis for a non-Eurocentric universalism
- Dussel-Apel debate on discourse ethics (4 papers): Examines the tension between Apel's formal universalism and Dussel's material ethics of liberation
- Intercultural philosophy as decolonial praxis (3 papers): Explores how intercultural dialogue challenges colonial epistemologies

SEARCH_SOURCES: PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CrossRef
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines critical responses to Dussel's account of Eurocentrism
from multiple perspectives within and beyond liberation philosophy. The
critiques cluster around three main issues: (1) methodological concerns about
Dussel's reliance on European philosophical frameworks despite his anti-
Eurocentric aims (Vargas, Irvine); (2) feminist interrogations of gender
essentialism and the construction of indigenous peoples in Dussel's theory
(Lange, Vuola); and (3) internal decolonial debates about the relationship
between liberation, democracy, and transmodernity (Castro-Gomez, Diaz
Fernandez). Marxist critiques appear less prominently in Anglophone
literature than feminist and methodological challenges. The edited volume
"Thinking from the Underside of History" (Alcoff & Mendieta, 2000) remains
the central text collecting diverse critical engagements with Dussel's work,
featuring contributions from Karl-Otto Apel, Lynda Lange, and others.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These critiques reveal the contested terrain of Dussel's Eurocentrism account
and illuminate where his philosophy of liberation remains vulnerable to
charges of performative contradiction (using European tools to critique
Europe), gender blindness, and ontological essentialism. Understanding these
debates is essential for assessing the coherence and limits of Dussel's
critique of Eurocentric modernity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Marxist critiques in English are underrepresented; most appear in Spanish-
language sources (e.g., Cerutti's work). Debates between postcolonial and
decolonial thinkers regarding Dussel's positioning appear primarily in
comparative frameworks rather than direct critical engagement. Few analytic
philosophers have engaged Dussel's work critically (Irvine is an exception).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize critiques by type (methodological, feminist, internal decolonial,
Marxist) rather than chronologically. Highlight the "Eurocentrism Problem"
(Vargas) as a central methodological challenge. Consider how feminist critics
(Lange, Vuola) expand the scope of critique beyond epistemology to gender
and sexuality. Note the productive tension between Dussel and Castro-Gomez
on transmodernity and democracy.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Methodological critique (Eurocentrism Problem): 3 papers - Charges Dussel with performative contradiction
- Feminist critique: 2 papers - Challenges gender essentialism and indigenous representation
- Internal decolonial debate: 4 papers - Contests Dussel's populism and transmodernity
- Analytic/ontological critique: 2 papers - Questions trans-ontology and analectic method

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain situates Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism in broader intellectual
contexts. The literature divides into four major comparative contexts: (1)
earlier Latin American philosophy debates on authenticity and originality (Zea,
Salazar Bondy), (2) dependency theory and world-systems analysis (Frank,
Wallerstein, Quijano), (3) European interlocutors on ethics and politics
(Levinas, Apel, Habermas), and (4) decolonial studies (Mignolo, Maldonado-Torres).
The SEP and IEP entries on Latin American philosophy provide crucial context
for understanding Dussel within the philosophy of liberation movement. Key
debates include whether Dussel's use of Levinas imports Eurocentric elements,
how his work relates to Marxist dependency theory, and his contested role as
founder vs. participant in decolonial studies.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These comparative studies reveal how Dussel's Eurocentrism critique emerged
from specific Latin American intellectual genealogies (particularly dependency
theory) while engaging critically with European philosophy. The debate over
whether Dussel's Levinas engagement is Eurocentric directly addresses the
project's central question about philosophical self-reference.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with Dussel's relationship to Salazar Bondy and Zea's
earlier authenticity debates. Few comparative studies with African or Asian
decolonial thinkers beyond brief mentions.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should trace Dussel's dual lineage from Latin American dependency
theory and European ethics, showing how these strands both support and
complicate his Eurocentrism critique. The Levinas debate is crucial for
understanding tensions in his work.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dussel as synthesis of Latin American and European traditions: 5 papers -
  Dussel integrates dependency theory with Levinas/discourse ethics
- Critical engagement position: 6 papers - Dussel's European interlocutors
  introduce Eurocentric elements
- Decolonial founder position: 4 papers - Dussel as foundational to decolonial
  studies alongside Quijano/Mignolo

  CORE ARGUMENT: Explores the "missed encounter" between Dussel and Ricoeur on questions of narrative, space, and historical understanding. Argues that while Dussel and Ricoeur share concerns about how narratives structure experience and identity, Dussel's spatial emphasis (center/periphery geography of modernity) diverges from Ricoeur's primarily temporal framework.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates how Dussel's critique of Eurocentric narratives of modernity involves a distinctive spatial-geographical dimension missing from mainstream hermeneutics. The center/periphery structure is essential to understanding how Dussel's account of Eurocentrism differs from purely cultural or epistemological critiques.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes an epistemic perspective from the "subaltern side of the colonial difference" to overcome dichotomies between political-economy and cultural studies, nationalism and colonialism, economic reductionism and culturalism. Develops the modernity/coloniality paradigm drawing on Dussel's transmodernity and Quijano's coloniality of power to redefine capitalism as a world-system.

  RELEVANCE: Major statement of decolonial theory that explicitly builds on Dussel's transmodernity concept while integrating it with Quijano's framework. Shows how Dussel's critique of Eurocentric modernity becomes a foundation for the broader modernity/coloniality research program. Essential for understanding Dussel's influence on contemporary decolonial studies.

  abstract = {Fichte'sWissenschaftslehreserves an existential as well as a scientific function, and the latter is in the service of the former. So runs a central thesis, and a central theme, of Daniel Breazeale's substantial and long-awaited book on Fichte's early (or 'Jena') philosophical system. That theWissenschaftslehrehas a scientific function is a point that Fichte often trumpets. In one of his preferred formulations, its task is to identify the ground or explanation of the system of representations that are accompanied by a feeling of necessity, and of the feeling of necessity itself. Elsewhere he emphasizes that its task is to identify "die Bestimmung des Menschen" -- the specific determination (or 'vocation') of man. On Breazeale's account, however, these scientific aims are in the service of an existential purpose that is perhaps best described as palliative. TheWissenschaftslehreis Fichte's "means for coming to terms with, and if possible, mitigating, the painful existential division within our own selves" (125).
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That striking formulation of Fichte's ambition was first proposed by Breazeale twenty years ago, in a paper published inFichte-Studien.Fichte-Studien, alas, is not on the shelves of every university library. But this book should be. Breazeale himself is the undisputed dean of Fichte scholarship in the English-speaking world, and among the most important commentators writing on Fichte in any language. Over the past four decades he has not only published scores of papers on Fichte, he has also translated the vast bulk of Fichte's Jena corpus into English, producing a series of masterful critical editions. Both through his own work, and though his influence on the broader scholarly project, he has improved exponentially both the quality and the quantity of primary and secondary material available on Fichte in English. The volume under review comprises fourteen of his papers, all of which were previously published in one form or another. But this is by no means simply a volume of collected essays. Like Fichte himself, Breazeale has not been content to leave his own earlier ideas alone. He has revisited and rethought all of these papers, and the reworking has in most instances led to substantial additions and revisions. The result is a book of great clarity and insight, the mature fruit of long reflection, and one that is really without equivalent in any language.

A memorable passage from the early correspondence provides an instructive glimpse of Fichte's existential project. Writing in the summer of 1795, Fichte was seeking a rapprochement with Jacobi, who would later denounce theWissenschaftslehreas "nihilism." Fichte's letter includes a riff on the Genesis narrative, in a paragraph that concludes with this thought: "Presumption led us to philosophize, and this cost us our innocence. We caught sight of our own nakedness, and since then we have had to philosophize for our salvation." (Breazeale quotes this passage at 137, 263, 379; the mode of composition of the book does result in a certain amount of repetition). So why exactly are we in need of salvation, on Fichte's story, and how could something as obscure and technical as theWissenschaftslehreserve such a function?

Breazeale's answer is framed in terms of "the divided self." Part of the human condition, on this accounting, is to find oneself torn. The division has apsychologicalmanifestation (again and again Breazeale emphasizes the resultingpain), and seems also to have hadbiographicalreality for Fichte himself (drawing on the earliest unpublished "night thoughts," Breazeale argues that Fichte's philosophical work was driven in no small part by personal anguish). But at its root, Breazeale argues, the division is ontological. There is, according to Breazeale's Fichte, "a division at the heart of man's very being as a free, finite agent acting within a spatio-temporal world" (134).

So what is this division, and how can the project of theWissenschaftslehreprovide any kind of help in coping with it? Breazeale characterizes it in a variety of interrelated ways. On one formulation, the division is between "theory and practice," or as Fichte sometimes puts it, between "head and heart." An essential part of human existence is that we both seek knowledge about the world and also act in it. According to Fichte, developing a theme from Kant's antinomies, this dual existence threatens a rupture, specifically with respect to human freedom. From our theoretical perspective, we treat all events, including human actions, as strictly determined; as agents, as Kant's famously puts it, "we act under the idea of freedom." For Fichte, the problem of free will is no mere intellectual puzzle. It puts us at odds with ourselves, with our most developed theoretical reflections threatening to make nonsense of our commitments as agents -- and vice versa. Breazeale: "[Man is] Torn between, on the one hand, the practical certainty of one's own freedom (or moral vocation) and, on the other, the equally undeniable feeling of constraint attendant upon one's empirical awareness of oneself as part and parcel of the natural world-order" (133).

Framed in these terms, one might expect that the "philosophical salvation" about which Fichte writes to Jacobi would take the form of some kind of compatibilism. If your existential suffering derives from the problem of free will, then the philosophy section of your local library is well-stocked with remedies that promise to ease the pain. It is surprising to see how little attention Fichte devotes to this option, particularly since Hume (arguably the grandfather of modern compatibilism) plays such an important role in Fichte's intellectual landscape, as Breazeale shows in his chapters on Aenesidemus (Ch. 2), Maimon (Ch. 3), and skepticism (Ch. 9). Breazeale finds a hint of quasi-rationalist "divine compatibilism" (8) in Fichte's very early book on religion, but the compatibilist theme in Hume's writings seems not to have made any impact on Fichte. Breazeale does at one point describe Fichte's transcendental idealist as "look[ing] for some way to reconcile the experienced passivity of the intellect with the practical certainty of his own freedom or capacity for self-determination" (249). But as we shall see, the reconciliation (such as it is) is highly attenuated, and informed by deeply incompatibilist commitments.

One possible source of those commitments comes into view with a second framing of the existential division: the tug-of-war between autonomy and heteronomy. Sometimes this contrast is framed in Kantian terms as a division between pure moral reason and heteronomous passions. Human nature exhibits "an unstable combination of rationality and sensibility" (345); the result is strife in the human soul. But this familiar and ancient description of the human struggle sits alongside something distinctively modern and idiosyncratically Fichtean. The telltale sign can be found in the particular way in which the drive for autonomy is framed. As Breazeale puts it, the Fichtean I is "predetermined to will independence and self-sufficiencyas the ultimate end of all actingand as the norm for evaluating particular, concrete courses of action" (179, emphasis added). Moreover, the Fichtean conception of self-sufficiency [Selbständigkeit] requires that the I "establish [its] independence and freedom . . .fromany source of external determination" (348, emphasis added).

It is worth pausing to reflect on just how extreme this position really is. The ancient Cynics and Stoics were agreed in placing a very high value on self-sufficiency [αὐτάρκεια], but its value was in large part instrumental. If I am dependent on other things or other people for my happiness, then my happiness is to that extent fragile and vulnerable. Cultivating self-sufficiency is thus a strategy to secure happiness and insure against contingencies that might result in ethical harm. Kant had of course made autonomy a central principle of ethics, but he did not treat autonomy as itself the ultimate end in action. For Kant the ultimate end was thesummum bonum, understood as a combination of happiness and virtue. The Fichtean position on autonomy seems to be much more extreme -- so extreme that it merits a name all its own. Let's call it autono-mania. Autonomy is not simply a value, or an important or central value in human existence; it is the final aim of all action, and requires an absence of determination by anything other than oneself.},

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how Dussel's myth of modernity critique targets the developmentalist assumptions embedded in Enlightenment thought.

When the author proposes his interpretation of history "against the grain," he challenges the linear and triumphalist conception of progress, proposing a historical materialism based on the memory of the oppressed and the redemption of the victims of the past. The work also highlights how Benjamin's critique of modernity, far from being an abstract reflection, has a practical and revolutionary dimension, linking his ideas with Latin American liberation philosophies and the need for a new critical look at history. In this sense, the article argues that theology, in Benjamin's thought, does not propose a doctrine, nor a treatise on God, but rather a critical tool that allows for the interruption of the hegemonic narrative of progress and the reconfiguration of social struggles from a radically new perspective, centered on resistance and the historical transformation of the oppressed.},

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the exact nature of Dussel's 1492 periodization claim: modernity's origin is not the Renaissance or Reformation (intra-European events) but the colonial encounter that simultaneously produces Europe's self-conception as "modern" and enacts violence on colonized peoples.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel develops a three-tiered ethics of liberation combining material (life-reproduction), formal (validity through discourse), and feasibility (strategic-institutional) criteria. He argues that dominant ethical systems presuppose the exclusion of victims and that ethics must begin from the interpellation of those denied life and recognition. The material principle—obligation to produce, reproduce, and develop human life—provides a universal but non-Eurocentric foundation grounded in corporeal vulnerability rather than abstract reason.

  RELEVANCE: This is the mature statement of Dussel's ethics after his decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel. It directly addresses the charge of Eurocentrism against Kantian and discourse ethics by showing how they presuppose an ideal community of communication that excludes victims of globalization. The concept of "exteriority" (those outside the system) provides Dussel's key diagnostic tool for identifying Eurocentrism in ethical theory—not merely as bias but as structural exclusion.

  POSITION: Defends a material ethics that grounds normativity in the appeals of victims while incorporating discourse-ethical procedures. Argues that material ethics has priority over formal ethics because discourse presupposes participants whose life has already been affirmed.

  abstract = {Enrique Dussel is Latin America’s foremost philosopher, renowned for his contributions to ethics, political philosophy, and liberation theology. Designed for classroom use, this collection of essays engages with Dussel’s encyclopedic work, making his valuable contributions accessible to English-speaking students. In addition to being one of the most original, prolific, and widely known members of the Latin American Philosophy of Liberation movement, Dussel has also made important contributions to world philosophy, the history of philosophy, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and the understanding of Karl Marx. Dussel famously engaged in a decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel on the relationship between material and formal ethics—that is, between an ethics of the community of life and an ethics of the community of discourse—and he has produced novel interpretations and analyses of the concepts of alterity, exteriority, the other, and the world history of ethical systems. Most recently, Dussel extended his work on an ethics of liberation into a politics of liberation, developed over the course of three published volumes. In this book, scholars from around the world assess Dussel’s work in ways that are both appreciative and critical. Two essays by Dussel bookend the volume: the collection opens with a consideration of the (im)possibility of multiple modernities and ends with an autobiographical trajectory of the philosopher’s thinking. In addition to Dussel and the editors, the contributors to this volume include Linda Martín Alcoff, Don Thomas Deere, Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, Mario Sáenz Rovner, Alejandro A. Vallega, and Jorge Zúñiga M.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mills provides a systematic introduction to the methodology and core concepts of Dussel's ethics of liberation, emphasizing how ethical responsibility emerges from responding to the appeals of victims of the capitalist system. He explains Dussel's three ethical principles (material, formal, feasibility) and how they integrate to form a comprehensive ethics. Mills argues that Dussel's ethics is critical for progressive political and economic theory in the Global North.

  RELEVANCE: The most accessible English-language introduction to Dussel's ethics, designed specifically for readers unfamiliar with liberation philosophy. Mills carefully explains how Dussel's material principle differs from utilitarian welfarism and how his formal principle differs from Habermasian consensus. Useful for understanding how Dussel's ethics responds to the accusation of particularism while critiquing universalist ethics as Eurocentric.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber examines the rationality of Dussel's philosophy of liberation through detailed analysis of Dussel's appropriation of Levinas's ethics and his debates with Apel, Ricoeur, Rorty, and Taylor. He argues that Dussel develops a coherent ethical hermeneutics grounded in the face-to-face encounter with the Other, but transformed from Levinas's transhistorical phenomenology into a material-historical ethics of victims. Barber critically assesses whether Dussel's integration of Levinasian alterity with Marxian materialism succeeds.

  RELEVANCE: The most comprehensive English-language study of Dussel's ethics from the 1970s through the 1990s. Barber's analysis of Dussel's critique of Apel illuminates the stakes of the material-formal debate: whether ethics can begin from excluded victims or must begin from participants in rational discourse. His treatment of Dussel's appropriation of Levinas is essential for understanding how exteriority functions in Dussel's diagnosis of Eurocentrism.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Maldonado-Torres situates Dussel's philosophy of liberation within the broader "decolonial turn" in Latin American thought, arguing that Dussel's concept of exteriority (exterioridad) provides a key epistemic and ethical category for theorizing coloniality. He traces how Dussel's ethics emerges from the historical experience of colonization and how the category of "the Other" functions not as abstract alterity but as the colonized subject denied full humanity. Dussel's ethics thus diagnoses Eurocentrism as the philosophical expression of colonial power.

  RELEVANCE: Connects Dussel's ethics to decolonial theory and the modernity/coloniality research program. Shows how Dussel's critique of European ethics is inseparable from his analysis of colonialism—Eurocentric ethics presupposes and legitimates colonial exclusion. Essential for understanding how Dussel's concept of exteriority operates as both epistemological and ethical critique of center-periphery structures.

  pages = {1--35},
  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel articulates the relationship between material ethics (grounded in life-reproduction) and formal moralities (grounded in discourse and validity). He argues that Kantian and discourse ethics are formal but must presuppose material conditions—participants must be alive, fed, capable of communication. Material ethics thus has priority: it establishes the conditions for any formal ethics. Dussel concludes with six principles for formulating a material ethics that is universalizable yet addresses massive poverty and exclusion.

  RELEVANCE: This article presents Dussel's core argument in the debate with Apel. It directly addresses how discourse ethics is Eurocentric by showing that it presupposes an ideal communication community from which victims are excluded. The material principle provides an evaluative standpoint available to those outside the system—victims know that the system denies life. This is Dussel's key move for grounding ethical critique in exteriority.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Apel responds to Dussel's critique of discourse ethics, defending the universality of the discourse principle while acknowledging the problem of excluded victims. He argues that discourse ethics provides the only coherent foundation for normative validity and that Dussel's material ethics cannot ground universal norms without smuggling in discourse-ethical assumptions. Apel contends that the problem of global poverty requires extending the discourse community, not abandoning formal ethics.

  RELEVANCE: Apel's direct response to Dussel in the volume dedicated to Dussel's philosophy. This exchange clarifies the stakes of the debate: can ethics begin from victims outside discourse, or must it begin from participants within discourse? Apel's position represents the view that Dussel critiques as Eurocentric—the assumption that ethical validity requires symmetrical communication among participants who are already recognized.

After defining liberation theology, this study identifies the crucial contributions made to it by Emmanuel Levinas’s assertion of the primacy of ethics over ontology and critique of the egocentric nature of Western philosophy. It then delineates the epistemological and deontological criticisms made of Roman Catholic orthodoxy—and institutionalized Christianity in general—by Latin American liberation theologians, particularly Enrique Dussel and José Porfirio Miranda. These are compared with Wang’s critique of the Rationalist Neo-Confucianism that had been official orthodoxy and the legitimating philosophy for imperial China for three centuries. The study finds that Wang’s Idealist philosophy incorporates epistemological, spiritual, and ethical perspectives with powerful democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure the development of late-twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. Thus, contrary to the conventional view of Confucianism as a conservative philosophy, these elements in Wang’s Neo-Confucianism render it a theology (or philosophy) of liberation.},

It analyses the challenges which come today from certain policies of human rights which instrumentalize them under the pretext of a “global war on terror” and redefi ne them in terms of democracy promotion and regime change, as well as those challenges which come from ideologies which question the core principles of human rights and provoke the so called “crisis of legitimization.” The paper argues for the necessity of restoring the genuine meaning of human rights and of the role of citizens in striving for their implementation. At the heart of the analysis is Kant’s concept of human rights as freedom. With Kant as its backdrop, the paper shows that the claim that religious worldviews provide the only intelligible foundation, as in Nicholas Wolterstorff, faces serious challenges in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. The paper then analyzes the non-religious philosophical concepts which seek to develop an account of human rights that does not depend upon controversial metaphysical or religious doctrines. It examines an account of human rights from the perspective of discourse ethics as developed by Karl-Otto Apel and Jurgen Habermas. It also analyses the concepts of human dignity and “emerging morality” by Arturo Roig and the “ethics of liberation” by Enrique Dussel.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Quintana Paz argues that Dussel's ethics of liberation contains internal contradictions when applied to the question of revolutionary violence.

He concludes that Dussel's arguments involve contradictions when he aims to justify violence with these interdisciplinary criteria.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a key tension in Dussel's ethics: can an ethics grounded in discourse and life-affirmation ever justify revolutionary violence? Quintana Paz argues that Dussel's formal principle (derived from discourse ethics) requires dialogue, which excludes violence.

Subjectivity reveals its fundamental form as intersubjectivity or border subjectivity.

  RELEVANCE: Examines how Dussel's ethics reconceptualizes subjectivity itself, moving from Cartesian ego to intersubjective self constituted through encounter with the Other. This connects to Dussel's Levinasian concept of exteriority—the self is not autonomous but responsive to the appeal of the Other. Shows how Dussel's ethics implies a critique of the subject presupposed by Eurocentric philosophy.

  abstract = {Fichte'sWissenschaftslehreserves an existential as well as a scientific function, and the latter is in the service of the former. So runs a central thesis, and a central theme, of Daniel Breazeale's substantial and long-awaited book on Fichte's early (or 'Jena') philosophical system. That theWissenschaftslehrehas a scientific function is a point that Fichte often trumpets. In one of his preferred formulations, its task is to identify the ground or explanation of the system of representations that are accompanied by a feeling of necessity, and of the feeling of necessity itself. Elsewhere he emphasizes that its task is to identify "die Bestimmung des Menschen" -- the specific determination (or 'vocation') of man. On Breazeale's account, however, these scientific aims are in the service of an existential purpose that is perhaps best described as palliative. TheWissenschaftslehreis Fichte's "means for coming to terms with, and if possible, mitigating, the painful existential division within our own selves" (125).
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That striking formulation of Fichte's ambition was first proposed by Breazeale twenty years ago, in a paper published inFichte-Studien.Fichte-Studien, alas, is not on the shelves of every university library. But this book should be. Breazeale himself is the undisputed dean of Fichte scholarship in the English-speaking world, and among the most important commentators writing on Fichte in any language. Over the past four decades he has not only published scores of papers on Fichte, he has also translated the vast bulk of Fichte's Jena corpus into English, producing a series of masterful critical editions. Both through his own work, and though his influence on the broader scholarly project, he has improved exponentially both the quality and the quantity of primary and secondary material available on Fichte in English. The volume under review comprises fourteen of his papers, all of which were previously published in one form or another. But this is by no means simply a volume of collected essays. Like Fichte himself, Breazeale has not been content to leave his own earlier ideas alone. He has revisited and rethought all of these papers, and the reworking has in most instances led to substantial additions and revisions. The result is a book of great clarity and insight, the mature fruit of long reflection, and one that is really without equivalent in any language.

A memorable passage from the early correspondence provides an instructive glimpse of Fichte's existential project. Writing in the summer of 1795, Fichte was seeking a rapprochement with Jacobi, who would later denounce theWissenschaftslehreas "nihilism." Fichte's letter includes a riff on the Genesis narrative, in a paragraph that concludes with this thought: "Presumption led us to philosophize, and this cost us our innocence. We caught sight of our own nakedness, and since then we have had to philosophize for our salvation." (Breazeale quotes this passage at 137, 263, 379; the mode of composition of the book does result in a certain amount of repetition). So why exactly are we in need of salvation, on Fichte's story, and how could something as obscure and technical as theWissenschaftslehreserve such a function?

Breazeale's answer is framed in terms of "the divided self." Part of the human condition, on this accounting, is to find oneself torn. The division has apsychologicalmanifestation (again and again Breazeale emphasizes the resultingpain), and seems also to have hadbiographicalreality for Fichte himself (drawing on the earliest unpublished "night thoughts," Breazeale argues that Fichte's philosophical work was driven in no small part by personal anguish). But at its root, Breazeale argues, the division is ontological. There is, according to Breazeale's Fichte, "a division at the heart of man's very being as a free, finite agent acting within a spatio-temporal world" (134).

So what is this division, and how can the project of theWissenschaftslehreprovide any kind of help in coping with it? Breazeale characterizes it in a variety of interrelated ways. On one formulation, the division is between "theory and practice," or as Fichte sometimes puts it, between "head and heart." An essential part of human existence is that we both seek knowledge about the world and also act in it. According to Fichte, developing a theme from Kant's antinomies, this dual existence threatens a rupture, specifically with respect to human freedom. From our theoretical perspective, we treat all events, including human actions, as strictly determined; as agents, as Kant's famously puts it, "we act under the idea of freedom." For Fichte, the problem of free will is no mere intellectual puzzle. It puts us at odds with ourselves, with our most developed theoretical reflections threatening to make nonsense of our commitments as agents -- and vice versa. Breazeale: "[Man is] Torn between, on the one hand, the practical certainty of one's own freedom (or moral vocation) and, on the other, the equally undeniable feeling of constraint attendant upon one's empirical awareness of oneself as part and parcel of the natural world-order" (133).

Framed in these terms, one might expect that the "philosophical salvation" about which Fichte writes to Jacobi would take the form of some kind of compatibilism. If your existential suffering derives from the problem of free will, then the philosophy section of your local library is well-stocked with remedies that promise to ease the pain. It is surprising to see how little attention Fichte devotes to this option, particularly since Hume (arguably the grandfather of modern compatibilism) plays such an important role in Fichte's intellectual landscape, as Breazeale shows in his chapters on Aenesidemus (Ch. 2), Maimon (Ch. 3), and skepticism (Ch. 9). Breazeale finds a hint of quasi-rationalist "divine compatibilism" (8) in Fichte's very early book on religion, but the compatibilist theme in Hume's writings seems not to have made any impact on Fichte. Breazeale does at one point describe Fichte's transcendental idealist as "look[ing] for some way to reconcile the experienced passivity of the intellect with the practical certainty of his own freedom or capacity for self-determination" (249). But as we shall see, the reconciliation (such as it is) is highly attenuated, and informed by deeply incompatibilist commitments.

One possible source of those commitments comes into view with a second framing of the existential division: the tug-of-war between autonomy and heteronomy. Sometimes this contrast is framed in Kantian terms as a division between pure moral reason and heteronomous passions. Human nature exhibits "an unstable combination of rationality and sensibility" (345); the result is strife in the human soul. But this familiar and ancient description of the human struggle sits alongside something distinctively modern and idiosyncratically Fichtean. The telltale sign can be found in the particular way in which the drive for autonomy is framed. As Breazeale puts it, the Fichtean I is "predetermined to will independence and self-sufficiencyas the ultimate end of all actingand as the norm for evaluating particular, concrete courses of action" (179, emphasis added). Moreover, the Fichtean conception of self-sufficiency [Selbständigkeit] requires that the I "establish [its] independence and freedom . . .fromany source of external determination" (348, emphasis added).

It is worth pausing to reflect on just how extreme this position really is. The ancient Cynics and Stoics were agreed in placing a very high value on self-sufficiency [αὐτάρκεια], but its value was in large part instrumental. If I am dependent on other things or other people for my happiness, then my happiness is to that extent fragile and vulnerable. Cultivating self-sufficiency is thus a strategy to secure happiness and insure against contingencies that might result in ethical harm. Kant had of course made autonomy a central principle of ethics, but he did not treat autonomy as itself the ultimate end in action. For Kant the ultimate end was thesummum bonum, understood as a combination of happiness and virtue. The Fichtean position on autonomy seems to be much more extreme -- so extreme that it merits a name all its own. Let's call it autono-mania. Autonomy is not simply a value, or an important or central value in human existence; it is the final aim of all action, and requires an absence of determination by anything other than oneself.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This collection of Dussel's essays spans ethics, history, Marxism, and liberation theology, demonstrating the interdisciplinary scope of liberation philosophy. Essays address the relationship between ethics and economics, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, Marxian categories reinterpreted from the perspective of the periphery, and the ethical foundations of liberation theology. Dussel argues that philosophy cannot be separated from historical praxis and that ethics emerges from the lived experience of domination and liberation.

  RELEVANCE: Provides access to key essays showing the development of Dussel's thought and the connections between his ethics, historical analysis, and political economy. Demonstrates how Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism operates across multiple domains—not only in ethics but in historiography and political economy. Essential for understanding the broader context of Dussel's ethics of liberation.

  POSITION: Collection demonstrating the interdisciplinary and praxis-oriented character of Dussel's liberation philosophy.

  abstract = {Among its other virtues, the book boasts an accurate and descriptive title: its purpose is to argue that the dominant trend in Jewish philosophy has run aground because of its reliance on artificially constructed categories like universal/particular, Jew/non-Jew, and Jerusalem/Athens. In that respect, it is an exercise in what Aaron Hughes calls "Jewish metaphilosophy." He takes issue with the rationalist tendencies that emerged from the nineteenth century movement known asWissenschaft des Judentumsas well as the particularist tendencies that one finds in the work of Franz Rosenzweig. Whatever one thinks of the substance of Hughes' arguments, there is no getting around the fact that he writes with flare and knows his sources extremely well. I am not aware of any recent book in the field of Jewish philosophy that presents as serious a challenge to those who practice it as this one.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Before getting to substance, let me offer something by way of introduction. The field of Jewish philosophy has always suffered from a lack of consensus on how to define it. If one were to teach a course on comparative religion in a modern university, one would likely include Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism. By the same token, if one were to list the nationalities that have played an important role in Western culture since 1492, one would likely include the French, Dutch, Germans, British, Spanish, Italians, Irish, Poles, and Jews. Note that Jews are the only group that gets mentioned twice. This has led to a long-standing question: Is Judaism primarily a religion defined by practice and belief or a nationality defined by group identity? How one answers this question will determine how one understands the discipline of Jewish philosophy.

No one questions that Maimonides, Mendelssohn, Cohen, Rosenzweig, Buber, and Levinas belong to this discipline. But what does one do with Philo, whose influence was mainly on early Christianity, Spinoza, who was excommunicated, Bergson, Husserl, or Wittgenstein? Even apart from Judaism, the problem of defining philosophy in terms of nationality has always been problematic. No one would bat an eye if one were to say that Aristotle is a central figure in Islamic philosophy, Frege in Anglo-American philosophy, or Husserl in French philosophy.

The result is that anyone who works in the field of Jewish philosophy has to cut Hughes a fair amount of slack. The categories that we use to describe the discipline are artificial to a great extent and reflect current academic or ideological biases. But Judaism is not the only culprit. In the 1980's, Richard Rorty argued that there is no identifiable method or body of results that would allow one to categorize such diverse thinkers as Parmenides, Aristotle, Descartes, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Russell, and Derrida as philosophers. To go a step further, if we were to look closely at the categories we use to teach the history of philosophy, e.g.,Neo-Platonist,rationalist,empiricist,existentialist, we might conclude that they are useful ways of organizing complicated material and teaching people how to think about it. But if we were to look at them closely with the eyes of a specialist, we would see that the boundaries of these categories are porous and that searching for an essence that all figures share is mainly a waste of time.

As Hughes shows in detail, take something as ill-defined asJudaism, put it together with something as ill-defined asphilosophy, and you are asking for trouble. You are asking for even more trouble if you think of Judaism as representing the particular and philosophy as representing the universal. In Hughes' words: "At the heart of Jewish philosophy is fracture and dislocation. . . . As philosophy, this activity makes claims to universal validity, but as an activity by a specific group of people, it must of necessity be inherently particularistic" (p. 1). In a manner reminiscent of Hegel and championed by Derrida, Hughes proceeds to show that dichotomies like universal/particular play off against each other and serve to destabilize each other. Instead, he proposes: "a Derridean-inspired reading of these two terms, one that argues that meaning does not arise out of fixed differences, but is produced and performed in ways that are always partial and provisional throughdifférance, in which differential meanings are endlessly deferred" (p. 2).

To be more specific, the problem with Jewish philosophy is that to overcome the impossibility of the task it sets for itself, it has to provide a picture of what "authentic" Judaism amounts to. In Hughes' opinion, this often leads to the claim that the philosopher has uncovered Judaism in its pristine, timeless, or original form. There are two problems with such an approach. First, the idea of a pristine form of Judaism unencumbered by modern or outside influences is a construction (read: fantasy) at odds with what the historical record shows to be the case. A good example of this tendency is Maimonides' contention that the patriarchs and Moses discovered physics and metaphysics before the Greeks but that due to centuries of political oppression, the records of their accomplishments have been lost. Second, once someone claims to have shown the way to authentic Judaism, it is difficult not to marginalize or even ignore everything deemed to be inauthentic. Turning to Maimonides once again, anyone who believes that God is material or even that God has multiple attributes does not count as Jewish. If this were to be enforced rigorously, it would mean that in any age, the majority of Jews would have to be read out of the faith. This is all a way of saying that the search for authenticity culminates in fantasy or dogmatism, often both.

Another of Hughes' complaints is the degree to which Jewish philosophy sees its task as apologetic. To defend Judaism against its nineteenth century critics, theWissenschaftmovement tried to show that it was just as rational and therefore just as worthy of being taught in the academy as the Christianity seen through the lens of Kant or Hegel. To accomplish this, they had to ignore the mystical tradition or regard it as an embarrassment that distorted the true meaning of the religion. Again from Hughes:

Jewish philosophy and also its academic study thus potentially make the tradition into something that it is not. In the desire to make the tradition conform to a standard of rationality it has created in its own image, Jewish philosophy creates a highly selective narrative that risks distortion or, at the very least, betrays a certain privileging.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zúñiga examines how Dussel grounds the material principle of life, arguing that it is neither derived from discourse ethics nor reducible to biological survival. The material principle is normative because human life is inherently vulnerable and interdependent—to deny life is to contradict the conditions for any ethical discourse. Zúñiga defends Dussel's material ethics against the charge of relativism, showing how it provides a universal but non-Eurocentric foundation.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the key philosophical question of how Dussel's material principle is grounded. This is crucial for assessing whether Dussel's ethics escapes Eurocentrism without falling into relativism. Zúñiga's argument that the material principle is universal because corporeal vulnerability is universal provides Dussel's response to critics who claim his ethics is merely regional or particularist.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors employ Dussel's Ethics of Liberation as framework for decolonial critique of Eurocentric criminological knowledge. They argue that punitive power in peripheral countries has been shaped by the colonial matrix of domination, and that critical criminology must be decolonized using Dussel's material criterion of life. The Ethics of Liberation contributes to reconfiguring punitive power in favor of vulnerable groups to reduce their victimization, but without creating new victims of exclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates application of Dussel's ethics beyond abstract moral philosophy to concrete questions of criminal justice. Shows how Dussel's material criterion provides evaluative standpoint for critiquing institutions in peripheral countries.

The theoretical contributions, in conjunction with the Ethics of Liberation, were employed to foster a critical awareness of the use of punitive power as a means of maintaining the colonial matrix of domination and exploitation, especially within the field of criminology. In conclusion, we also presented the contribution of the Ethics of Liberation to a new configuration of punitive power, now employed in favor of vulnerable groups with the aim of eliminating or reducing their victimization within the current world system.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Chambers argues that the "coloniality of knowledge" thesis central to Latin American decolonial theory (Quijano, Mignolo, Dussel, Castro-Gómez) is epistemologically problematic. He contends that these thinkers offer distorted readings of Enlightenment figures (Descartes, Hume), make overgeneralized claims about "Western epistemology," and ultimately embrace epistemic relativism that undermines both social science and the subaltern's capacity to speak. The critique challenges whether decolonial epistemology can coherently ground its political aspirations.

  RELEVANCE: This is a major critical intervention in decolonial epistemology that directly targets Dussel's epistemological foundations. Chambers identifies what he sees as internal contradictions in Dussel's attempt to critique Eurocentrism while relying on European conceptual tools. For a review of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique, this represents the strongest philosophical objection to the epistemological dimension: does Dussel's position collapse into self-undermining relativism? The paper is essential for understanding limits and criticisms of Dussel's epistemological project.

I argue that the epistemological claims of four decolonial thinkers (Aníbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, Enrique Dussel, Santiago Castro-Gómez) that make up the coloniality of knowledge thesis are problematic for several reasons: they are based on distorted and simplistic readings of Descartes, Hume and other Enlightenment figures; they make contentious generalizations about so-called Western epistemology; and they ultimately lead to epistemic relativism, which is a problematic basis for the social sciences and, contrary to decolonial aspirations, renders the subaltern unable to speak.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendoza and Grijalva provide a feminist critique of early decolonial epistemology (Quijano, Dussel), arguing that while decolonial theorists cite Chicana feminist scholarship, they ignore Latin American feminist work and fail to adequately theorize the coloniality of gender. They contend that the social pacts between white capitalists and white working-class men that structure both democracy and citizenship make gender inseparable from analyses of coloniality. The authors argue for a distinctly Latin American feminist epistemology that cannot be substituted by Chicana theory.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals a significant gap in Dussel's epistemological project: the insufficiently theorized intersection of gender and coloniality of knowledge. Mendoza and Grijalva's critique demonstrates that Dussel's account of epistemic privilege and geopolitics of knowledge may reproduce patriarchal exclusions even while challenging Eurocentrism.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmenga, Van der Zande, and Zwitter defend Dussel's decolonial philosophy against charges that it either lapses into skepticism (via excessive critique) or dogmatism (via excessive alterity). They argue that Dussel's "analectics" successfully balances critique and alterity by grounding philosophical discourse in material life, thereby reconciling universality and rationality without falling into either extreme. Against Castro-Gómez and Vallega's criticisms, they interpret Dussel as a relational thinker whose universalism is context-sensitive rather than abstractly Eurocentric.

  RELEVANCE: This recent defense addresses the most sophisticated philosophical objections to Dussel's epistemology. It directly engages the tension identified by Chambers (2020) between critique and relativism, arguing that Dussel's rationalism can be defended on its own terms.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper analyses the tension between the double focus on critique and alterity within decolonial discourses. We argue that an excess of critical thinking could lead to scepticism, whereas an overemphasis on alterity could result in dogmatism. Consequently, since both approaches end up obstructing epistemic decolonization, we argue that it is necessary to strike a balance between critique and alterity; a balance that does not resolve the tension, but seeks to reveal its underlying relation. The first section locates decolonial theory within the framework of critical theory. We highlight how Quijano, Dussel and Mignolo invoke the critical tradition, whilst simultaneously claiming that a radical departure from it is necessary. Turning more explicitly to Dussel in Section 2, we explain Dussel’s analectics as a method to localize discourses, in which globally excluded perspectives are foregrounded. In the third section, we defend Dussel’s universalism and rationalism against criticisms from Castro-Gómez and Vallega by interpreting him as a relational thinker. Ultimately, the paper concludes that the success of epistemic decolonization hinges on its ability to reconcile classic notions of universality and rationality in a manner that avoids dogmatism and scepticism, namely by a continual grounding of philosophical discourse in material life.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Vargas identifies what he calls the "Eurocentrism Problem" in Latin American philosophy of liberation: these philosophers critique Eurocentrism and advocate resisting European conceptual frameworks, yet their own work relies heavily on European philosophical terminology and theoretical apparatus (especially Levinas, Heidegger, Marx). Vargas argues that this tension between aims and methods has not received adequate reply, and reflects underlying flaws in the liberation philosophy program. He suggests the project needs recasting to eliminate dependence on European conceptual foundations.

Vargas's argument anticipates later criticisms (Chambers, Irvine) and represents a persistent challenge to Dussel's epistemology. For the review, this establishes a key debate: is Dussel's reliance on European philosophy (Levinas especially) self-undermining, or can philosophical concepts be appropriated and transformed across geopolitical contexts?

  abstract = {In this paper I consider a problem that has plagued various versions of the philosophy of liberation. 1 On the one hand, proponents of the philosophy of liberation generally counsel that various forms of liberation in at least the Americas requires that we should fight Eurocentrism and resist the ontology and conceptual framework of Europe. On the other hand, most of the work done in this tradition relies heavily on the terminology and theoretical apparatus of various strands of European philosophy. The apparent disconnect between the aims and methods (or if you like, the theory and practice) has given rise to a criticism I call The Eurocentrism Problem. 2 In what follows, I argue that the Eurocentrism Problem has not received an adequate reply. Until it has, there is reason to be skeptical about the philosophy of liberation as it currently exists. However, a reply can be made — though it requires we fundamentally change how the philosophy of liberation is conceived of and how it is developed. In section 1, I consider the motivations and implications of the Eurocentrism criticism. In section 2, I take up and criticize an important reply to it and offer a blueprint for an alternative conception of the philosophy of liberation. In the final sections I consider objections and replies 1. The Eurocentrism Problem The Eurocentrism Problem has several facets that we can group under the headings of dialectical, contextual, pedagogical, and practical issues. In what follows, I give a brief characterization of each of these facets of the Eurocentrism Problem. The most obvious worry is that because the philosophy of liberation is pursued in the terminology and categories of European philosophers, it re-inscribes the Eurocentrism that it2 struggles against. If one thinks, as Enrique Dussel and others have maintained, that European categories and concepts have played a crucial role in the historical3 and contemporary4 domination of the Americas, a philosophy of liberation that relies on those categories will seem a sham. Genuine liberation — economic, cultural, sexual, and so on — appears compromised when such liberation is framed in terms of the conceptual system that is bound up with the very systems of domination it is supposed to overcome. This is the dialectical facet of th},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Irvine critically examines Dussel's "analectic" or "anadialectic" method, which claims to go beyond Western ontology through "revelation" of the Other, thereby achieving a "trans-ontology." Irvine questions whether analeptic actually transcends Western thinking or whether it remains within the Western philosophical tradition. He proposes a classically Western ontological critique that, he argues, remains relevant even in the "age of globalization and exclusion" that Dussel addresses.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the most sustained analytic philosophical engagements with Dussel's epistemological method. Irvine's critique challenges whether Dussel's "trans-ontology" is genuinely new or simply a variant of existing Western categories. The paper is important for assessing whether Dussel successfully develops an epistemology "from the periphery" or whether his method is parasitic on the very frameworks he critiques.

  POSITION: Critical analytic examination. Questions the novelty and coherence of Dussel's analectic method from a Western philosophical standpoint.

  title = {Global Ethics, Epistemic Colonialism, and Paths to More Democratic Knowledges},
  howpublished = {Philpapers},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Stone-Mediatore analyzes how colonialist elements implicit in prominent global ethics anthologies foster attitudes of superiority and aloofness toward economically struggling communities, even when these texts advocate aid to "the global poor." Drawing on Dussel, Linda Tuhiwai Smith, and other scholars of colonialism, she traces colonialist legacies in global ethics literature and proposes strategies for unsettling this epistemic colonialism and cultivating skills for more democratic global knowledge communities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a concrete case study of epistemic colonialism in contemporary academic practice (global ethics pedagogy and scholarship). Stone-Mediatore applies Dussel's insights about geopolitics of knowledge to show how seemingly neutral or even progressive ethical frameworks reproduce colonial power relations through knowledge production and circulation. The paper is crucial for demonstrating the practical implications of Dussel's epistemological critique beyond abstract philosophical debate.

This essay argues, however, that prominent global-ethics anthologies remain burdened by Eurocentric/colonialist elements that contradict efforts to build more ethical transnational communities. Drawing on scholars of coloniality, including Enrique Dussel, Anibal Quijano, and Linda Tuhiwai Smith, the essay traces colonialist elements in deep structures of prominent global ethics texts. It examines how, even when texts argue for aid to the poor, these elements foster tendencies in the affluent world to detach from and dehumanize people on the other side of global hierarchies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gandolfo provides an overview of liberation philosophy as a distinctive strand in Latin American thought, examining key figures including Arturo Andrés Roig, Ignacio Ellacuría, and Ofelia Schutte. He situates liberation philosophy within broader debates about Latin American philosophical identity, the proper tools and methods of philosophy, and ontological questions about the nature of being. The chapter highlights how liberation philosophy challenges dominant frameworks by centering questions of domination and liberation.

  RELEVANCE: This handbook chapter provides essential context for understanding Dussel's epistemological project within the broader movement of Latin American liberation philosophy. Gandolfo's overview helps situate Dussel's specific contributions (especially his epistemological and methodological claims) in relation to parallel developments by other liberation philosophers. The chapter is valuable for synthesis because it clarifies what is distinctive about Dussel's epistemology versus common features of liberation philosophy generally.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Linhart provides a critical analysis of scientific universalism through the lens of geopolitics of knowledge. Drawing on the modernity/coloniality research program (Quijano, Mignolo, Dussel, Lander), along with feminist and postcolonial science studies, he argues that modern science functions as a means to stigmatize, subalternize, and oppress both nature and marginalized peoples. The chapter demonstrates how the universalist claims of modern science mask its geopolitical situatedness and serve colonial projects.

  RELEVANCE: Linhart extends Dussel's epistemological critique to the specific domain of scientific knowledge production. The chapter is important for showing how Dussel's ideas about the geopolitics of knowledge apply to natural sciences (not just humanities/social sciences), and for connecting Dussel's framework to broader literatures in science studies, feminist epistemology, and postcolonial theory. This helps establish the contemporary relevance and applicability of Dussel's epistemological insights.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hoagland examines dimensions of the "coloniality of knowledge" by analyzing how Western epistemological frameworks structure what counts as legitimate knowledge and who counts as a knower. Drawing on postcolonial theory and decolonial scholarship, she identifies how colonial power relations persist in contemporary knowledge production practices, often invisibly reproducing hierarchies between global North and South, Western and non-Western knowledge systems.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides conceptual clarification of "coloniality of knowledge," a central concept in Dussel's epistemology. Hoagland's analysis helps specify what exactly is "colonial" about dominant epistemological frameworks and how this differs from overt imperialism or cultural imperialism. The paper contributes to understanding the mechanisms by which Eurocentric epistemology maintains its dominance even after formal decolonization.

  publisher = {Fordham University Press},
  address = {New York},
  year = {2020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber presents Dussel's thought through the concept of "ethical hermeneutics," interpreting reality from the viewpoint of the Levinasian "Other"—those excluded from socio-political or cultural systems. He traces Dussel's development toward Levinas through engagement with Hegelian dialectics and stages of Dussel's ethical theory. Barber argues that Dussel's hermeneutics offers a rationality that is neither abstractly universal nor merely relative, but situated in the perspective of victims of domination.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most comprehensive English-language treatment of Dussel's epistemological-hermeneutic method. Barber's concept of "ethical hermeneutics" clarifies how Dussel's epistemology integrates ethical and interpretive dimensions: knowledge is always knowledge-for-someone, and the epistemic privilege of the oppressed derives from their material-ethical position. The book is essential for understanding the relationship between Dussel's epistemology and his broader philosophical project.

  volume = {20},
  number = {2},
  pages = {6--11},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vizcaíno offers a genealogy of the trope of fetishization in Dussel's liberation philosophy and argues that the "anti-fetishist" method central to this tradition risks perpetuating Eurocentrism. Drawing on recent cultural anthropology showing how the notion of "fetishism" emerges from Eurocentric anthropology of religion and misrepresents Afro-Atlantic religions, Vizcaíno contends that without revising the metaphysical premises of anti-fetishism, liberation philosophy contradicts its own commitment to epistemic decolonization.

  RELEVANCE: This is a provocative internal critique of Dussel's epistemological method. Vizcaíno argues that one of Dussel's key epistemological-critical concepts (anti-fetishism, derived from Marx) itself carries unexamined Eurocentric baggage. This challenges whether Dussel has successfully escaped Eurocentrism or has smuggled it in through his theoretical apparatus. The critique is important for assessing the coherence and consistency of Dussel's decolonial epistemology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume collects critical essays on Dussel's philosophy of liberation from diverse perspectives: Karl-Otto Apel on discourse ethics and liberation, Lynda Lange on feminist critique of Dussel's construction of indigenous peoples, Elina Vuola on feminism and liberation theology, Walter Mignolo on geopolitics of knowledge, Michael D. Barber on Dussel's use of Marx and Marion, Mario Saenz on living labor, and Linda Martin Alcoff on Dussel and Foucault. The volume represents the most comprehensive Anglophone critical engagement with Dussel's work through 2000.

  RELEVANCE: This is the single most important collection of critical responses to Dussel in English. It brings together methodological, feminist, theological, and philosophical critiques from scholars working in analytic philosophy (Apel), feminist theory (Lange, Vuola), postcolonial studies (Mignolo), and phenomenology (Barber). The volume is essential for understanding the range of critical perspectives on Dussel's liberation philosophy and provides the foundation for subsequent Anglophone engagement with his work.

  POSITION: Represents critical dialogue from within and adjacent to liberation philosophy. Contributors are generally sympathetic to decolonial and liberatory projects but raise substantive concerns about Dussel's methods, gender politics, and philosophical assumptions. The volume models productive critical engagement rather than dismissive rejection.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Dussel's philosophy of liberation provides a decolonial corrective to Eurocentric political theology (Badiou, Žižek, Agamben) by centering early Christian thought on community and collectivity from the perspective of the Global South. Demonstrates this through a reading of Dussel's study of Marx's theological metaphors and applies the framework to Caribbean poet Pedro Mir's "Countersong to Walt Whitman," showing how Mir constructs a redemptive state of rebellion against imperial exception.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how Dussel's political philosophy engages with the political theology tradition while critiquing its Eurocentric foundations. Shows how Dussel's liberationist thought can be applied to literary and cultural analysis as a "poetics of liberation" that unravels the transformation of political and theological discourses. Directly addresses the research project's concern with Dussel's alternative to European political frameworks.

  POSITION: Sympathetic reconstruction of Dussel's political theology as corrective to European political theology; situates Dussel as precursor to contemporary debates on Christian Marxism from Global South perspective.

  keywords = {political-theology, liberation-theology, transmodernity, High},
  abstract = {In recent decades, thinkers like Alain Badiou, Slavoj Žižek, and Giorgio Agamben have argued for a serious political engagement with early Christian thought and its emphasis on collectivity and community. Notwithstanding their important theoretical contributions, these writers often remain within a limited Eurocentric framework, foreclosing the possibility of a truly decolonial political theology. Crucially, their relatively recent reappraisals tend to ignore important precursors of Christian Marxism from the Global South, namely liberation theology and the philosophy of liberation, as elaborated by the Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel. This essay contextualizes Dussel’s liberational thought in the contexts of political theology and literary representation. It pays particular attention to Dussel’s study of the Theological Metaphors of Marx by synthesizing a model of literary inquiry based on his philosophy and applying it to a reading of counter-hegemonic poetry by the Caribbean poet Pedro Mir, namely his long poem “Countersong to Walt Whitman.” This reading makes explicit the implicit theological dimension of Mir’s poetic text. Finally, the essay conceptualizes this interpretive model as a poetics of liberation: a mode of engagement with mutually determining discourses – politics, poetics, aesthetics – as well as a mode of reading which unravels the transformation of these discourses in lyrical forms. Writing from the periphery of the US empire, Mir therefore constructs a mode of address which arms itself with both political and theological discourses, however implicitly. To the empire’s miraculous state of exception, Mir counterpoises a redemptive state of rebellion.},

The starting point is the political power of the community grounded in rational consensus, where the rational is the real (corporeal living human being).

This essay places Goswami’s critique within a context of “the thought from outside,” which, beginning with Foucault’s reading of Blanchot, continuing through the geopolitics of Dussel’s philosophy of liberation, and prominent in Catherine Malabou’s conceptualization of plasticity, demonstrates how political critiques of philosophical hegemony contain an implicit theorization of “literature.” If “literature” gives voice to the thought from outside, does it in turn “decolonize” philosophy? If so, what itinerary of thought ought to follow the relationship between this literary decolonization of philosophy and its imbrication within the fold of philosophical thought? How to conceptualize the plastic relation between inside and outside, between center and periphery, without subordinating the latter to the hegemony of the former? This essay argues for a coherence between Goswami’s and Malabou’s materialist understandings of difference and a conceptualization of literature as an “outside” to philosophy that operates “excentrically” “inside” philosophy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Dussel's philosophy and politics of liberation surpass the "civilizatory" political philosophies of Western modernity by investigating their Eurocentric roots that subordinated Latin America without recognizing the epistemological rupture signified by the invasion of America. Dussel's critical thought gives voice to the excluded, revalues multiple heterogeneous knowledges, and imagines reality otherwise. Examines six theses including Las Casas/Suárez/Vitoria heritage, analysis from exteriority, contemporaneity of liberation philosophy, liberating ethics, geopolitical thought, and transmodernity.

  RELEVANCE: Comprehensive Spanish-language overview of Dussel's philosophy and politics of liberation as counter-hegemonic field. Important for understanding Dussel's retrieval of early modern Iberian political theology (Las Casas, Vitoria) as resources for decolonial thought. Shows how transmodernity surpasses the modernity-coloniality of the world-system.

Indaga sus raíces filosóficas y políticas eurocéntricas, que terminaron por subordinar a América Latina, sin reconocer el quiebre epistemológico que significó la invasión de América, al fundar la modernidad como totalidad del sistema mundo. Su pensamiento crítico, como contra-relato, da voz a los olvidados o excluidos, revaloriza saberes múltiples, heterogéneos, donde el poder, o la pluralidad de contrapoderes, tienden a ser negados o acallados, pero resisten y re-sienten la dominación. Dussel, imagina la realidad otramente; aquí se destacan seis tesis: 1) La herencia de Las Casas, Suárez y Vitoria; de la teología política a la modernidad colonial(izada); 2) El análisis desde la exterioridad en el pensamiento eurocéntrico; 3) La contemporaneidad de la filosofía y la política de la liberación; 4) Eurocentrismo y ética liberadora; 5) El pensamiento geopolítico y la modernidad en la política de la liberación; 6) La Transmodernidad en Dussel, que supera la modernidad-colonialidad del Sistema Mundo.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the framework and limits of political action from the perspectives of Franz Hinkelammert and Enrique Dussel. Both thinkers critique the fetishization of political and economic systems that subordinate human life to abstract institutional imperatives.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Dussel's method of "analectics" as alternative to Hegelian dialectics. Argues that while dialectics proceeds through internal negation and sublation, analectics begins from the revelation of the Other who stands outside the totality. This methodological difference grounds Dussel's political philosophy: politics must begin from the exteriority of the excluded rather than from immanent contradictions of existing institutions.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding the philosophical method underlying Dussel's political philosophy. The analeptic method—beginning from the Other's revelation rather than systemic contradiction—provides the basis for Dussel's critique of Eurocentric political theory that starts from constituted political orders. Relevant for assessing whether Dussel's method successfully escapes Hegelian-Marxist frameworks or remains dialectical.

Essas culturas periféricas foram colonizadas, excluídas, desprezadas, negadas e ignoradas pela Modernidade eurocentrada, porém, não foram eliminadas.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel proposes transmodernity as an alternative to both European modernity and postmodernity, arguing for symmetrical intercultural dialogue between peripheral cultures that were colonized but not eliminated by Eurocentered modernity. He distinguishes transmodernity from postmodernity by emphasizing dialogue with the exteriority of modernity rather than internal European critique.

  RELEVANCE: This is Dussel's foundational statement on transmodernity and interculturality, directly addressing how he responds to relativism charges. The article articulates his vision of concrete universality emerging from intercultural dialogue among excluded cultures, providing the philosophical architecture for escaping the universalism-relativism dilemma central to Domain 5.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lange provides a feminist critique of Dussel's construction of indigenous peoples in his theory of modernity. She argues that Dussel's "transmodern" framework, while critical of European colonial constructions, nevertheless relies on problematic essentializations of indigenous identity. Lange contends that Dussel's approach risks reducing indigenous peoples to symbols in a philosophical narrative rather than recognizing their complex historical agency and diverse experiences. She questions whether modernism and postmodernism should be as sharply distinguished as Dussel suggests.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most sustained feminist critique of Dussel's treatment of indigenous peoples and gender in the "Thinking from the Underside of History" volume. Lange's critique is essential for understanding how Dussel's philosophy of liberation has been received by feminist scholars who argue that his framework, despite its liberatory aims, reproduces problematic gender and colonial assumptions. The critique raises questions about whether Dussel's transmodernity adequately attends to intersectional oppressions.

  POSITION: Represents feminist philosophy's critique of liberation philosophy's gender blindness. Lange operates from feminist epistemology and postcolonial feminist theory, arguing that Dussel's framework needs feminist correctives to avoid essentializing indigenous identity and ignoring gender as constitutive of colonial domination.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Irvine offers an ontological critique of Dussel's "trans-ontology" and analectic method. He questions whether Dussel's analectic approach genuinely goes beyond Western thinking about being, as Dussel claims. Irvine proposes an ontological critique that is "classically Western" yet "classically relevant" even in the context of globalization and exclusion. He argues that Dussel's attempt to move beyond ontology to ethics of the Other does not escape the conceptual frameworks of Western metaphysics.

  RELEVANCE: This is a rare analytic philosopher's engagement with Dussel's core methodological claims about trans-ontology and analectics. Irvine's critique challenges whether Dussel's philosophical innovation (moving beyond ontology through the ethical relation to the Other) succeeds or whether it remains captive to the Western philosophical tradition it seeks to transcend. The critique raises fundamental questions about the coherence of Dussel's philosophical method.

  POSITION: Represents an analytic philosopher's skepticism about continental and Latin American philosophy's attempts to transcend Western ontology. Irvine argues for the continuing relevance of "historically Western" yet "classically relevant" ontological frameworks, implicitly questioning the necessity and success of Dussel's decolonial philosophical project.

  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vuola examines the relationship between Dussel's liberation philosophy, liberation theology, and feminist thought. She argues that while liberation theology and philosophy have made important contributions to understanding structural oppression, they have often been gender-blind. Vuola explores how feminist theology and philosophy can engage productively with Dussel's work while critically addressing its limitations regarding gender and sexuality. She advocates for "thinking otherwise" - maintaining liberation philosophy's structural critique while incorporating feminist insights.

  RELEVANCE: Vuola's chapter is the most sustained engagement with Dussel from the perspective of feminist theology and philosophy. It demonstrates how feminist scholars working within liberatory traditions can simultaneously appreciate and critique Dussel's contributions. The chapter is essential for understanding the feminist reception of liberation philosophy and the debates about whether liberation theology/philosophy can be adequately reformed to address gender or whether feminist alternatives are needed.

  POSITION: Represents feminist theology and philosophy in critical dialogue with liberation theology/philosophy. Vuola operates from within liberatory traditions but insists on the centrality of gender analysis. She argues for productive engagement rather than wholesale rejection, modeling how feminist critique can strengthen rather than abandon liberation projects.

  booktitle = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber compares Dussel's reading of Marx with Jean-Luc Marion's phenomenology of the idol/icon distinction, examining how both thinkers address the problem of totalization and the reduction of the Other. Barber argues that Dussel's appropriation of Marx through Levinas's ethics of alterity parallels Marion's critique of idolatry in metaphysics and theology. Both seek to preserve the transcendence of the Other against reductive theoretical frameworks that turn the infinite into a finite object of consciousness.

  RELEVANCE: Barber's chapter demonstrates how Dussel's philosophical method can be understood through comparison with contemporary phenomenology. The analysis helps clarify what is distinctive about Dussel's reading of Marx (via Levinas) and shows how Dussel's concerns about theoretical totalization connect to broader continental philosophical debates about alterity, phenomenology, and ethics. This positions Dussel within European philosophical conversations while highlighting his Latin American distinctiveness.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic phenomenological engagement with Dussel. Barber is one of the leading interpreters of Dussel in Anglophone philosophy and consistently works to make Dussel's thought accessible to continental philosophers. His approach is integrative rather than critical, showing connections between Dussel and European thinkers.

  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mignolo situates Dussel's philosophy of liberation within the geopolitics of knowledge, arguing that Dussel's ethics emerges from a specific geopolitical location (Latin America) that has been historically marginalized in the global production of philosophy. Mignolo connects Dussel's work to the broader project of "border thinking" and the "colonial difference," showing how liberation philosophy challenges the Eurocentric geography of reason by thinking from the colonial periphery.

  RELEVANCE: Mignolo's chapter is essential for understanding how Dussel's work fits within the broader modernity/coloniality/decoloniality research program. It demonstrates how Dussel's ethics of liberation is not merely a regional variant of European philosophy but a fundamentally different epistemic project emerging from the colonial difference. This positioning is central to debates about whether Dussel overcomes Eurocentrism or remains captive to it.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic decolonial interpretation from within the modernity/coloniality research program. Mignolo is a colleague and collaborator of Dussel's who shares the project of epistemic decolonization. His chapter works to legitimate Dussel's philosophy as a genuine alternative to Eurocentric thought rather than a derivative application of European frameworks.

  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Saenz examines Dussel's reading of Marx, focusing on the concept of "living labor" and how Dussel uses Marx to develop a materialist ethics grounded in the affirmation of life. Saenz shows how Dussel's interpretation of Marx differs from orthodox Marxism by centering the ethical relation to the worker as living subject rather than focusing exclusively on economic structures. Dussel reads Marx through Levinas, producing a synthesis of materialism and ethics of alterity.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter is important for understanding Dussel's relationship to Marxism and how his liberation philosophy engages with but transforms historical materialism. It addresses implicit Marxist critiques that Dussel abandons class analysis for cultural/ethical critique, showing instead how Dussel integrates materialist and ethical concerns. The chapter is essential for assessing whether Dussel's Marx is a distortion or a productive reading.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic interpretation of Dussel's Marx from within Latin American philosophy. Saenz works to show the coherence and originality of Dussel's synthesis of Marx and Levinas, defending it against both orthodox Marxist and liberal critics who see the combination as incoherent or reductive.

  doi = {10.61497/kseaqj31},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Camelo argues that Santiago Castro-Gomez's critical engagements with Dussel - both agreements and disagreements - were fundamental in constructing Castro-Gomez's vision of "transmodern democracy." Camelo develops this thesis through critical dialogue between the two philosophers around three analytical keys: pueblo (people), democracia (democracy), and transmodernidad (transmodernity). He concludes that transmodernity is the convergent point between both philosophical proposals despite their differences on populism and democratic structure.

  RELEVANCE: This recent article illuminates the ongoing internal decolonial debate about democracy, populism, and emancipatory politics. It shows how Castro-Gomez critically appropriates Dussel's concept of transmodernity while rejecting Dussel's populist politics. The debate is essential for understanding disagreements within decolonial thought about the relationship between the people, power, and democratic institutions.

  POSITION: Represents internal decolonial debate from a Colombian philosophical perspective. Camelo examines the productive tension between Dussel's populist politics of liberation and Castro-Gomez's republican decolonial politics, showing how both build on yet contest each other's frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendieta examines Dussel's critique of universal history and globalization, showing how Dussel challenges Eurocentric narratives that present European modernity as the telos of world history. Mendieta argues that Dussel's philosophy of liberation offers a counter-narrative that centers the experiences and perspectives of colonized peoples, revealing how "universal history" is actually a particular European story masquerading as global truth.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter is important for understanding Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism as fundamentally a critique of how history is narrated and universalized. Mendieta shows how Dussel's decolonial historiography connects to his broader ethical and political project. The chapter helps position Dussel's work in relation to debates about postcolonial history, subaltern studies, and the politics of historical representation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Pachon examines the relationship between historiography, Eurocentrism, and claims to universality in Dussel's work. He analyzes how Dussel's philosophy of liberation attempts to construct a non-Eurocentric universal history while avoiding both Eurocentric universalism and relativist particularism. Pachon explores the tensions in Dussel's project between critique of Eurocentric historiography and the construction of an alternative universal framework.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses a central tension in Dussel's work: how to critique Eurocentric universality while constructing a genuinely universal (rather than merely particular or regional) alternative. The question is whether Dussel's transmodernity is itself a form of universalism or an affirmation of pluriversality. Understanding this tension is essential for assessing Dussel's relationship to postmodern critiques of metanarratives.

  POSITION: Represents Latin American philosophical analysis examining internal tensions in Dussel's project. Pachon is sympathetic to Dussel's aims but questions whether the execution succeeds in escaping the problems it identifies in Eurocentric thought.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Alcoff stages a dialogue between Dussel's liberation philosophy and Foucault's genealogy of power/knowledge, examining how both thinkers analyze the relationship between knowledge production and domination. She argues that while Dussel and Foucault share concerns about how power operates through knowledge systems, they differ in their approaches to resistance and liberation. Alcoff explores what each thinker can learn from the other regarding the colonial unconscious and epistemic decolonization.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter is important for understanding how Dussel's work relates to poststructuralist critique, particularly Foucault's analysis of power/knowledge. It addresses questions about whether Dussel's ethics of liberation is compatible with or opposed to Foucauldian genealogy. The dialogue helps position Dussel in relation to debates about agency, resistance, and the possibility of liberation within poststructuralist frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Vargas argues that despite the philosophy of liberation's

  project examined in this review—whether a philosophy that critiques
  Eurocentrism can avoid Eurocentrism. Vargas's critique suggests that Dussel's
  use of European philosophy (particularly Levinas, Marx, and discourse ethics)
  undermines his anti-Eurocentric goals. This represents an important internal

  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber interprets Dussel's philosophy of liberation through
  the concept of "ethical hermeneutics," which seeks to interpret reality from
  the viewpoint of the "other" (drawing on Levinas)—those excluded from existing
  socio-political systems. Barber traces Dussel's intellectual development
  toward Levinas's philosophy, showing how Dussel moves beyond Hegelian
  dialectics toward an "analectical" method that affirms the other's
  transcendence. The book emphasizes rationality and ethical obligation in
  Dussel's project.

  RELEVANCE: Barber's study is the most comprehensive English-language treatment
  of Dussel's engagement with Levinas, making it crucial for evaluating whether
  Dussel's use of a European philosopher (Levinas) compromises his critique of
  Eurocentrism. Barber argues that Dussel's appropriation of Levinas serves
  liberation aims, but critics question whether this importation of European
  philosophy undermines Dussel's anti-Eurocentric stance.

  pages = {315--330},
  doi = {10.1177/0191453704041575},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beach argues that Dussel both appropriates and fundamentally
  challenges Levinas by grounding the Other in concrete historical and material
  conditions rather than in transcendental phenomenology. While Levinas presents
  the Other as abstractly transcendent, Dussel identifies the Other with
  specific historically oppressed groups (colonized peoples, the poor). This
  historicization transforms Levinas's ethics into a political philosophy of
  liberation.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies how Dussel's use of Levinas differs from
  straightforward appropriation—Dussel radically recontextualizes Levinas's
  European philosophy within Latin American historical experience. This is
  crucial for evaluating whether Dussel's Levinas engagement represents
  Eurocentrism or a decolonizing transformation of European thought. The debate
  over whether Dussel successfully de-Europeanizes Levinas is central to
  assessing the coherence of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Niblett examines the relationship between economic and cultural
  dependency, framing the analysis through Dussel's methodological insistence on
  international transfer of surplus value as the essence of dependency. The paper
  traces dependency theory's development in the 1960s-1970s and considers how
  cultural analysis (particularly Sylvia Wynter's work) emerged as a crucial site
  for understanding power. Niblett argues that literary works provide barometric
  readings of underdevelopment pressures in advance of political-economic analyses.

  RELEVANCE: This article situates Dussel's philosophy of liberation within the
  broader dependency theory tradition (Frank, Cardoso, Marini), showing how his
  Eurocentrism critique emerged from Latin American political economy rather than
  solely from European philosophy. This contextualization is crucial for
  understanding Dussel's dual intellectual lineage from both dependency theory
  and European ethics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schutte provides a critical analysis of Latin American
  philosophy's engagement with cultural identity and liberation, including
  extended treatment of the philosophy of liberation movement (Dussel, Roig,
  Cerutti-Guldberg). She critiques the philosophy of liberation for inadequately
  addressing gender and sexuality concerns, arguing that liberation discourse has
  been dominated by masculine perspectives. Schutte situates Dussel within
  debates about cultural authenticity, dependency, and emancipation.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the earliest sustained English-language critiques of
  Dussel's philosophy of liberation from a feminist perspective sympathetic to
  its anti-colonial aims. Schutte's critique that liberation philosophy fails to
  adequately accommodate gender concerns reveals another dimension of exclusion
  in Dussel's work—not Eurocentrism but masculinism. Her work contextualizes
  Dussel within broader Latin American debates about identity and liberation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ghosh provides a comprehensive survey of dependency theory
  from its classical formulations (Prebisch-Singer, Frank, Amin) through
  contemporary revisions. The book examines peripheral writers on dependency

  theory within broader debates about development, underdevelopment, and unequal
  exchange. Contemporary sections address globalization, technological
  imperialism, and brain drain as new forms of dependency.

  RELEVANCE: While not focused on Dussel specifically, this comprehensive
  overview situates dependency theory—a key intellectual source for Dussel's
  philosophy of liberation—within global development debates. Understanding
  dependency theory's evolution helps clarify how Dussel's Eurocentrism critique
  emerged from Latin American political economy rather than solely from European
  philosophy. The book's treatment of Frank, Wallerstein, and Amin shows the

  CORE ARGUMENT: Maldonado-Torres examines three thinkers who rethink the human
  in post-imperial ways: Levinas, Fanon, and Dussel. He analyzes how each
  responds to European master morality of domination and control. The dissertation
  evaluates Dussel's appropriation of Levinas through analysis of Fanon, arguing
  that while Dussel should have been more Fanonian than Levinasian at certain
  points, his work contributes importantly to overcoming Western master morality
  of aggression and control.

  RELEVANCE: This dissertation is crucial for understanding Dussel's relationship
  to both European philosophy (Levinas) and African/Caribbean decolonial thought
  (Fanon). Maldonado-Torres suggests that Dussel's Levinas engagement may limit
  his decolonial radicality compared to Fanon's more thoroughgoing critique. This

  that defend life against capitalist domination. She affirms the Philosophy of
  Liberation as an ethical foundation for Latin American studies and argues for
  an "anti-management attitude" that transcends North/South management
  distinctions. The article critically engages postcolonial studies and argues
  for the superiority of decolonial approaches (Quijano, Dussel) for analyzing
  capitalist power's victims.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates how Dussel's work (particularly in
  dialogue with Quijano) informs contemporary critical management and
  organizational studies. It shows Dussel's influence extending beyond philosophy

title: "Enrique Dussel's Account of Eurocentrism: A Literature Review"

## Introduction

Enrique Dussel stands as one of the principal architects of Latin American philosophy of liberation, developing across six decades a comprehensive critique of European modernity from what he calls "the underside of history" (Alcoff and Mendieta 2000). His work emerges from and speaks to the experience of 1492 and the colonial violence that, he argues, constitutes the founding moment of modernity itself. Unlike European critics of modernity who diagnose its pathologies from within—Habermas on the incomplete project of Enlightenment, Adorno on reason's dialectical self-destruction—Dussel writes from the perspective of those subjected to modernity's "dark side": the colonized, the conquered, the periphery rendered invisible by Europe's self-narration as universal (Dallmayr 2004).

Eurocentrism in Dussel's account is not a correctable bias, a matter of insufficient attention to non-European contributions that more inclusive scholarship might remedy. Rather, it names a structural feature of how European modernity constitutes itself as the center, the measure, and the telos of world history (Grosfoguel 2011). The myth of modernity—Dussel's signature diagnosis—operates through what he calls "encubrimiento" (covering-up): the process by which colonial violence is justified as the necessary cost of bringing civilization, reason, and progress to peoples constructed as pre-modern, underdeveloped, lacking (Camelo 2018; Ayala-Colqui 2019). This is not a false consciousness to be dispelled through better theory but a constitutive operation embedded in modernity's self-understanding. The developmental fallacy that treats non-European societies as merely backward versions of Europe's future, the universalization of particular European institutions as the endpoint of rationality, the exclusion from philosophical discourse of those whose lives modernity negates—these are not accidental features but structurally necessary to modernity's project (Pimenta 2025).

Dussel's critique thus operates simultaneously across multiple registers. Historically, he argues that modernity originates not in intra-European events (Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment) but in 1492, the moment when Europe's self-conception as "modern" emerges through its domination of the colonial periphery. Ethically, he contends that Kantian and discourse-ethical frameworks presuppose an ideal community of communication from which victims—those whose corporeal life the system denies—are systematically excluded. Epistemologically, he diagnoses the "geopolitics of knowledge": the Cartesian ego cogito presupposes the colonial ego conquiro, such that claims to universal reason mask their particular European location. Politically, he argues that liberal democratic theory begins from constituted power rather than from the constituent power of the people, thereby fetishizing institutions and foreclosing the appeals of the excluded (Maldonado-Torres 2011).

This literature review examines the secondary scholarship on Dussel's account of Eurocentrism across five thematic sections. Section 1 analyzes his myth of modernity thesis, the 1492 periodization, and the proposal of transmodernity as decolonial alternative. Section 2 examines his ethics of liberation, focusing on the concepts of exteriority, the material principle of life, and the victim as epistemological-ethical standpoint. Section 3 addresses his epistemological critique and the major objections to it, particularly the charge that his use of European conceptual tools (Levinas, Marx, discourse ethics) undermines his anti-Eurocentric aims. Section 4 explores his political philosophy, centering on the potentia/potestas distinction and debates about populism and democracy. Section 5 synthesizes feminist, internal decolonial, and philosophical critiques that identify limits and tensions in Dussel's framework.

The review prioritizes Spanish-language secondary literature alongside foundational Anglophone sources, engages both sympathetic and critical positions, and tracks unresolved debates rather than adjudicating them. It organizes material thematically across Dussel's philosophical domains rather than surveying scholarship domain by domain. Three argumentative threads run throughout: the totality/exteriority dialectic as Dussel's core conceptual structure, the performative tension in using European philosophy to critique Eurocentrism, and the question of whether universalism without Eurocentrism is philosophically coherent. These threads reflect persistent questions in the secondary literature about the scope, limits, and internal consistency of Dussel's decolonial project.

## 1. Modernity, 1492, and the Structure of the Myth

Dussel's foundational claim is that modernity's origin lies not in intra-European cultural transformations but in the colonial encounter of 1492. This periodization is not merely historical revisionism but a philosophical argument about how European self-understanding is constituted. As Ayala-Colqui (2019) emphasizes, 1492 marks the "birth" of modernity as concept—the moment when Europe's self-conception as "modern" emerges through the simultaneous acts of colonial domination and what Dussel calls "encubrimiento" (covering-up) of the non-European Other. The myth of modernity operates not as falsehood but as justification: colonial violence is inscribed within discourses that present civilization, reason, and emancipation as goods that warrant the sacrificial destruction of alternative life-forms (Camelo 2018). Pimenta (2025) traces the intellectual evolution of this thesis across Dussel's career, demonstrating how his engagement with dependency theory, World-System analysis, and Frankfurt School critical theory produces a transdisciplinary understanding of modernity as fundamentally geopolitical rather than narrowly cultural or philosophical.

The myth functions through what Dussel identifies as the developmental fallacy: the treatment of non-European societies as "underdeveloped" rather than as bearers of alternative rationalities and forms of life with their own internal validity. Europe's narrative arc—from Renaissance humanism through Enlightenment universalism to contemporary liberal democracy—is posited as the trajectory of reason itself, rendering invisible those who stand outside this story or who refuse its terms. This is the totality against which Dussel's concept of exteriority operates: the colonial periphery is not merely excluded from European modernity but actively constituted as its negation, the pre-modern space that modernity defines itself against and claims the right to transform (Camelo 2018). The myth thereby enacts a double operation: it universalizes European particularity and it justifies violence as the necessary cost of bringing the "not-yet-modern" into the circle of humanity and reason.

### 1.1: Dussel's Critique of European Theorists of Modernity

Dussel's periodization challenges not only triumphalist Eurocentric histories but also European critical theories of modernity that, in his view, remain blind to the colonial underside of their own conceptual frameworks. His engagement with Habermas exemplifies this critique: while Habermas diagnoses modernity's pathologies and defends its incomplete emancipatory project, he accepts without question that modernity originates in intra-European events and unfolds according to an internal European logic. Dallmayr (2004) explores how Dussel's perspective from the colonized periphery both challenges and potentially complements Frankfurt School critical theory. Where Adorno and Heidegger diagnose modernity's dialectic of enlightenment or the forgetting of Being, they do so from within Europe's self-understanding, never interrogating how colonial domination is constitutive of that very modernity they critique. Ramaglia (2019) situates Dussel's approach comparatively within Latin American philosophy by contrasting it with Bolivar Echeverria's critical theory, revealing two distinct strategies for thinking modernity from the perspective of the Global South.

The target of Dussel's critique is not European philosophy as such but the operation by which a particular historical experience—Europe's—is elevated to universal status. Hegel's reading of world history as culminating in Europe, the Enlightenment's identification of its own rationality with Reason itself, discourse ethics' presupposition of an ideal speech situation that already excludes those whose lives the system denies—these are instances of what Dussel diagnoses as the totalizing gesture. The problem is not that European thinkers theorize modernity but that they theorize it from a standpoint they mistake for the standpoint of humanity as such, thereby rendering philosophically invisible the violence by which that standpoint was achieved. What is missing in European self-critique, Dussel argues, is the perspective from exteriority—from those who experience modernity not as emancipation but as conquest, not as the unfolding of reason but as the negation of their life and thought.

### 1.2: Transmodernity as Alternative

Dussel's constructive proposal, transmodernity, responds to this diagnosis by proposing a pluriversal reconstitution of modernity that incorporates the suppressed cultural and rational resources of colonized peoples. Transmodernity is not the rejection of modernity's achievements—scientific rationality, human rights discourse, democratic institutions—but the insistence that these achievements be decoupled from their Eurocentric shell and opened to dialogue with other cultural projects (Lozano Suarez 2021). It differs from postmodernity, which Dussel reads as an internal European critique that remains parasitic on modernity's categories, and from cultural nativism, which would abandon modernity's rational gains. Deere (2025) analyzes transmodernity as a plural vision of global modernity that opens multiple possible modes of being and thinking, though he raises critical questions about how Dussel constructs the colonial "other" and argues for a materialist rather than absolute vision of alterity.

Grosfoguel (2011) positions Dussel's transmodernity as foundational for the broader modernity/coloniality research program, showing how it integrates with Quijano's concept of the coloniality of power to produce a framework that redefines capitalism as a world-system structured by racialized hierarchies originating in 1492. Transmodernity on this reading is not merely a utopian horizon but a methodological commitment: it names the practice of thinking from the perspective of those excluded from modernity's self-narration, thereby revealing what that narration cannot acknowledge. The key tension in the secondary literature concerns whether transmodernity succeeds as an alternative or remains primarily diagnostic. Lozano Suarez (2021) demonstrates how Santiago Castro-Gomez appropriates and transforms Dussel's concept, framing transmodernity as an "analectical" method that takes modernity's rational achievements while opposing domination. Yet the precise institutional and epistemic content of a transmodern world remains less developed in Dussel's work than the critique of Eurocentric modernity that motivates it. This asymmetry—powerful diagnosis, less determinate alternative—runs through much of the secondary literature and reflects a broader challenge for decolonial philosophy: how to articulate a genuinely pluriversal future without either falling back into Eurocentric universalism or fragmenting into incommensurable cultural particularisms.

## 2. Exteriority, the Victim, and the Ethics of Liberation

Dussel's ethics of liberation represents his most sustained attempt to diagnose and transcend Eurocentrism within moral philosophy itself. The central claim is that dominant European ethical frameworks—Kantian deontology, utilitarian consequentialism, Habermasian discourse ethics—are Eurocentric not because their authors happen to be European but because they structurally presuppose the exclusion of victims. These ethics begin from participants already recognized within a moral or communicative community, rendering invisible those denied entry: the colonized, the impoverished, those whose corporeal life the system negates (Dussel 2013). Dussel's material principle of ethics—the obligation to produce, reproduce, and develop human life—grounds moral critique not in abstract consensus or formal procedures but in corporeal vulnerability and the appeals of those excluded from discourse. His concept of exteriority, appropriated from Levinas but transformed into a material-historical category, provides the standpoint from which the totality of existing ethical systems can be interrogated and judged.

### 2.1: Levinas Transformed—Exteriority as Material-Historical Category

Dussel's appropriation of Levinas constitutes one of the crucial moves in his ethics and simultaneously illustrates the performative tension that runs through his project. Levinas's concept of the "face" of the Other—the ethical demand that precedes and grounds ontology—provides Dussel with a philosophical vocabulary for thinking responsibility to those outside the system. Yet where Levinas articulates the ethical relation in transhistorical phenomenological terms, Dussel historicizes and materializes it. The Other is not an abstract alterity but the colonized subject, the poor, the victim of globalization whose concrete corporeal suffering interpellates the existing order (Barber 1998). Beach (2004) analyzes how Dussel challenges Levinas by refusing the separation of ethics from history and politics: the face that makes its ethical demand is always already the face of someone positioned within structures of domination and exclusion.

Barber's (1998, 2020) comprehensive treatments trace how Dussel's ethical hermeneutics integrates Levinasian alterity with Marxian materialism, arguing that this synthesis produces a rationality grounded in the perspective of victims rather than in abstract universals. The transformation of Levinas is deliberate: exteriority becomes not a phenomenological structure of subjectivity but a geopolitical-material category naming those positioned outside the centers of power and discourse. Yet this appropriation is contested within the secondary literature. Maldonado-Torres (2011) argues that Dussel should have relied more heavily on Fanon than Levinas, since Fanonian analysis of colonial racism addresses the racialized dimensions of exteriority that Levinas's phenomenology cannot capture. The reliance on Levinas instantiates what Vargas (2005) identifies as the "Eurocentrism Problem": Dussel critiques Eurocentric ethics using conceptual tools drawn from European philosophy, raising questions about whether his framework genuinely transcends or merely reconfigures the traditions it aims to overcome.

### 2.2: The Material Principle and the Dussel-Apel Debate

The decade-long debate between Dussel and Karl-Otto Apel represents the most sustained philosophical engagement with Dussel's ethics and clarifies the stakes of his critique of Eurocentrism. Dussel's mature ethics articulates three principles: a material principle grounded in the reproduction and development of human life, a formal principle requiring discursive validation of norms, and a feasibility principle addressing strategic-institutional implementation (Dussel 1997). His central claim is that the material principle has priority: discourse ethics presupposes participants who are alive, fed, housed, capable of communication. Victims excluded from the ideal speech situation—those whose lives the system denies—cannot participate as equals in discourse, yet their exclusion reveals the system's material injustice. Material ethics thus provides a critical standpoint available to those in exteriority, a way of knowing that the system negates life even when participants within the system cannot or will not acknowledge this negation.

Apel's (2000) response defends the priority of formal-procedural ethics, arguing that discourse ethics already contains resources for addressing excluded victims and that Dussel's material principle cannot ground universal norms without presupposing the very communicative rationality it claims to supersede. The debate turns on whether ethics must begin from participants within discourse or from those excluded from it, and whether corporeal vulnerability can provide genuinely universal normative grounds or whether universality requires formal consensus. Sorensen (2010) analyzes Dussel's critique as a form of ideology critique, showing how Dussel argues that discourse ethics functions ideologically by universalizing the perspective of the included, but raises the critical question of whether Dussel's own ethics escapes this trap by universalizing the perspective of victims.

Zuniga (2021) defends Dussel's material principle against the relativism charge, arguing that corporeal vulnerability is genuinely universal—all human beings require the material conditions for life—and thus provides a non-Eurocentric foundation for ethics that does not reduce to cultural particularity or regional bias. Hurtado Lopez (2012) and Knauss (2013) explore how Dussel moves from the factual existence of excluded persons to normative critique, examining whether the material principle successfully grounds universal ethical obligations. The debate remains unresolved in the literature: sympathetic readers defend the universality of corporeal need as an alternative to abstract rationality, while critics question whether material ethics can generate determinate norms without smuggling in discourse-ethical assumptions.

### 2.3: The Victim as Epistemological-Ethical Standpoint

Dussel's concept of the victim integrates his ethics with his broader epistemological project. Victims possess epistemological privilege: they know that the system denies life in ways that participants within the system cannot or will not acknowledge (Knauss 2013). This is not merely a claim about perspective or standpoint in the sociological sense but an ethical-epistemological argument: exclusion from the totality provides access to truths about that totality unavailable to those positioned within it. The victim's appeal—the interpellation that reveals the system's violence—thus functions simultaneously as ethical demand and epistemological disclosure. This connects Dussel's critique of Eurocentric ethics to the broader geopolitics of knowledge: just as the colonial periphery sees what the metropolitan center cannot see about the structure of modernity, victims know what participants in discourse cannot know about the material violence that discourse presupposes and obscures.

Allen's essay in the 2021 volume examines a critical tension in this framework: Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism for universalizing European development as the telos of world history may inadvertently rely on Eurocentric categories of progress and development in its own account of liberation (Allen in Allen and Mendieta 2021). If liberation is conceived as the development of human capacities or the realization of human potential, has Dussel escaped the developmental logic he critiques in European modernity? Diaz Fernandez (2022) provides a critical secular reading of Dussel's entire philosophical trajectory from within Latin American philosophy, noting tensions in the passage from ethics to politics and engaging Horacio Cerutti's early critique of Dussel's populist phase. Cerutti's challenge—that Dussel's early work romanticized "the people" and failed to account for internal differences and conflicts among the oppressed—raises questions about whether the victim as epistemological category can bear the theoretical weight Dussel assigns it or whether it flattens the heterogeneity of those positioned in exteriority.

The secondary literature thus reveals a fundamental debate about Dussel's ethics: does it successfully ground a non-Eurocentric universalism in the material vulnerability shared by all human beings, or does it reproduce Eurocentric patterns by privileging a particular standpoint (the victim) and a particular telos (liberation as development)? Defenders emphasize that corporeal need is genuinely universal and that centering victims corrects for the exclusionary bias of formal ethics. Critics identify unresolved tensions: between the universality Dussel claims and the particularity of the victim's perspective, between the critique of developmental thinking and the reliance on categories of human flourishing, between the formal-procedural resources Dussel incorporates and the material priority he asserts. The debate with Apel crystallizes these tensions without resolving them, and the feminist critiques examined in later sections extend this line of questioning by asking whether Dussel's account of the victim adequately theorizes how gender and sexuality intersect with colonial exclusion.

## 3. Epistemology, Geopolitics of Knowledge, and the Eurocentrism Problem

Dussel's epistemological critique operates at a more fundamental level than his ethical and political arguments: it challenges the very claim of Eurocentric philosophy to speak from a universal standpoint unmarked by particular geopolitical location. The thesis of the "geopolitics of knowledge" holds that all knowledge production is situated within structures of power, and that what presents itself as universal reason is in fact the perspective of the colonial metropole universalized and naturalized (Retamozo 2017). This critique targets not merely the content of European epistemology but its form: the pretension to occupy a view from nowhere, the separation of knowing subject from historical-material conditions, the construction of objectivity as detachment rather than as acknowledgment of one's position within relations of domination. Against this, Dussel proposes that genuine knowledge requires recognition of one's geopolitical standpoint and openness to the perspective of those positioned in exteriority—those whom dominant epistemology renders epistemically invisible or constructs as objects of knowledge rather than knowing subjects.

### 3.1: The Geopolitics of Knowledge

Dussel's most striking formulation holds that the Cartesian "ego cogito" presupposes the colonial "ego conquiro": the thinking subject of modern European philosophy is constituted through and depends upon the conquering subject of colonial domination. Retamozo (2017) provides the most systematic Spanish-language analysis of how this epistemological critique translates into questions of social science methodology. He examines three foundational issues for critical social science consistent with liberation philosophy: the construction of objectivity, criteria of demarcation and truth, and the logic of research. Retamozo argues that while Dussel develops the "analectic" method for philosophical reflection—thinking from the perspective of exteriority—its application to concrete social scientific practice remains underdeveloped. The question is not whether to pursue objectivity but how to construct it in ways that acknowledge rather than obscure the geopolitical situatedness of the researcher and the power relations embedded in knowledge production.

Alcoff's (2000) dialogue between Dussel and Foucault clarifies what the geopolitics of knowledge adds beyond Foucauldian genealogy. Where Foucault traces how power operates through the production of knowledge and the constitution of subjects, he does so primarily within European institutional contexts—the clinic, the asylum, the prison. Dussel's framework centers the colonial dimension: knowledge production is not only disciplinary (in Foucault's sense) but geopolitically structured by the colonial difference between metropole and periphery. The West's self-understanding as the locus of rationality, science, and progress depends upon constructing non-Western societies as lacking these capacities, thereby justifying both epistemic and political domination. This is not an accidental feature of particular theories but a structural operation by which European modernity constitutes itself.

Stone-Mediatore (2023) demonstrates how this critique applies to contemporary academic practice through a case study of global ethics pedagogy. She argues that prominent global ethics anthologies, even when advocating for aid to the global poor, reproduce colonialist epistemology through their deep structures: they position affluent Northern readers as knowing subjects who will decide what justice requires, while constructing Southern communities primarily as objects of ethical concern rather than as producers of knowledge about justice and social transformation. This epistemic colonialism fosters detachment and dehumanization even within ostensibly progressive frameworks. Stone-Mediatore draws on Dussel alongside Linda Tuhiwai Smith to propose pedagogical strategies for unsettling these patterns and cultivating more democratic global knowledge communities.

Hoagland (2020) extends the coloniality of knowledge critique by analyzing how researchers are positioned to be scholars precisely through relations of domination that marginalize others. The capacity to produce recognized knowledge is not neutral but depends upon institutional positions and resources structured by colonial and class hierarchies. This suggests that epistemic decolonization requires not only changes in what is studied or which voices are cited but transformation of the material conditions and power relations that determine who can speak as a knower and whose knowledge circulates as authoritative. These analyses demonstrate that Dussel's epistemological critique is not merely philosophical abstraction but identifies concrete mechanisms through which Eurocentric knowledge reproduces itself even within projects that explicitly aim to challenge it.

### 3.2: The Eurocentrism Problem—Does Dussel Escape It?

The most acute philosophical challenge to Dussel's epistemology is what Vargas (2005) formulates as the "Eurocentrism Problem": liberation philosophy critiques Eurocentrism and counsels resistance to European conceptual frameworks, yet relies heavily on European philosophical terminology and theoretical apparatus—especially Levinas, Heidegger, Marx, and discourse ethics. Vargas argues that this performative tension between aims and methods reflects fundamental flaws in the liberation philosophy program. If European categories and concepts have played a crucial role in historical and contemporary domination of the Americas, then a philosophy of liberation framed in those categories appears self-undermining. Genuine liberation would seem to require escaping rather than appropriating the conceptual system bound up with domination.

Chambers (2020) extends this critique into a systematic indictment of decolonial epistemology. He argues that the "coloniality of knowledge" thesis central to Quijano, Mignolo, Dussel, and Castro-Gomez rests on distorted readings of Enlightenment figures (Descartes, Hume), makes overgeneralized claims about "Western epistemology" that ignore its internal diversity, and ultimately embraces epistemic relativism that undermines both social science and the subaltern's capacity to speak. Chambers contends that decolonial theorists misread Enlightenment epistemology by treating it as monolithic when it contains significant internal debates and resources for self-correction. The charge of relativism is particularly serious: if knowledge is always geopolitically situated and the West's claim to universality is merely the universalization of its particularity, on what grounds can decolonial theory claim that its own perspective is true rather than merely the perspective of the colonized? Chambers argues that without universal epistemological standards, decolonial critique cannot ground the social scientific knowledge it needs to support its political aspirations.

Irvine (2010) offers an ontological critique of Dussel's "trans-ontology" and analectic method. Dussel claims that analectics goes beyond Western ontology through "revelation" of the Other, achieving a genuinely new philosophical starting point. Irvine questions whether this move succeeds or whether Dussel's framework remains within the Western philosophical tradition it claims to transcend. His critique operates from what he calls a "classically Western" yet "classically relevant" standpoint, arguing that standard ontological questions retain their force even in the context of globalization and exclusion. If Dussel's trans-ontology is parasitic on the very ontological categories it seeks to overcome, then his epistemological project may not represent a genuine alternative but a variant of existing European frameworks.

Vizcaino (2021) provides an internal critique focused on Dussel's use of anti-fetishism derived from Marx. Drawing on recent cultural anthropology showing that the notion of "fetishism" emerges from Eurocentric misrepresentations of Afro-Atlantic religions, Vizcaino argues that Dussel's anti-fetishist method smuggles in unexamined Eurocentric categories. The concept of fetishism itself encodes colonial assumptions about proper and improper forms of religious consciousness, rationality, and social organization. Thus even when Dussel deploys anti-fetishism critically—to diagnose how commodity fetishism or the fetishization of power obscures social relations—he may reproduce the very epistemic colonialism his framework aims to overcome. This critique cuts deeper than Vargas's because it targets not merely Dussel's sources but the conceptual tools he takes to be critical.

Against these objections, Timmenga, Van der Zande, and Zwitter (2025) defend Dussel's epistemology as successfully navigating between dogmatism and skepticism. They argue that Dussel should be read as a "relational thinker" whose universalism is context-sensitive rather than abstractly Eurocentric. Analectics balances critique (the questioning of totalizing systems) with alterity (attention to what the system excludes) by continually grounding philosophical discourse in material life. This grounding provides a universal standpoint—all human beings depend on material conditions for life—without reducing to either Eurocentric rationalism or epistemic relativism. Timmenga et al. defend Dussel's rationalism against Castro-Gomez's and Vallega's criticisms, arguing that decolonial epistemology requires precisely this balance: sufficiently universal to avoid fragmenting into incommensurable perspectives, sufficiently particular to acknowledge geopolitical situatedness and power asymmetries.

Yet Vargas's challenge has not received an adequate reply in the literature. Defenders of Dussel (Barber, Retamozo, Timmenga) demonstrate that his epistemology is more sophisticated than crude relativism and that philosophical concepts can be appropriated across geopolitical contexts. But they have not fully addressed the question of whether this appropriation is coherent given Dussel's own premises. If European philosophical frameworks are structurally implicated in colonial domination—not accidentally but constitutively—then can those frameworks be transformed through appropriation, or must genuinely decolonial philosophy begin from radically different conceptual resources? The debate remains unresolved, marking the Eurocentrism Problem as the most serious philosophical objection to Dussel's epistemological project.

### 3.3: Feminist Corrections to Decolonial Epistemology

Feminist scholars have identified a distinct but related gap in Dussel's epistemology: its insufficient theorization of gender as a constitutive axis of colonial knowledge production. Mendoza and Grijalva (2022) argue that early decolonial epistemology—Quijano's coloniality of power, Dussel's geopolitics of knowledge—neglects Latin American feminist scholarship while citing Chicana feminist theory. This represents a form of epistemological colonialism within the decolonial project itself: Chicana theory is invoked to address gender, while Latin American feminists who have theorized the intersection of gender, race, class, and coloniality are ignored. Mendoza and Grijalva contend that gender cannot be added to decolonial epistemology as a supplementary category; rather, the "coloniality of gender" must be recognized as fundamental to how colonial power structures knowledge production. The social pacts between white capitalists and white working-class men that structure both democracy and citizenship reveal that gender hierarchies are inseparable from the colonial matrix of power.

Lange (1998) provides a feminist critique of how Dussel constructs indigenous peoples in his theory of modernity and transmodernity. She argues that Dussel's framework, despite its liberatory aims, risks reducing indigenous peoples to symbols in a philosophical narrative rather than recognizing their complex historical agency and diverse experiences. Lange questions whether Dussel adequately attends to how gender and colonial domination intersect in the construction of indigenous identity, and whether his account of exteriority can accommodate the ways that indigenous women are positioned differently than indigenous men within colonial structures. The construction of "the victim" or "the Other" in Dussel's epistemology tends to be figured implicitly as male, obscuring how colonial violence and epistemic exclusion operate through racialized and gendered hierarchies simultaneously.

Schutte (1993) offers an earlier critique of liberation philosophy's masculinism, arguing that the framework privileges class and colonial position while undertheorizing how gender and sexuality function as axes of domination and exclusion. These feminist interventions suggest that Dussel's account of exteriority and epistemic privilege is incomplete. If the geopolitics of knowledge is also gendered—if women in the global South are positioned differently as knowers than men in the global South, and if this positioning reflects colonial legacies of gendered racial violence—then Dussel's epistemology needs substantial reconstruction to account for intersectional dimensions of epistemic exclusion. The feminist critiques thus identify an internal limit to Dussel's Eurocentrism critique: it challenges the universalization of European masculine perspectives but does not adequately interrogate how gender structures the very categories of victim, exteriority, and epistemic privilege upon which his framework depends.

## 4. Political Power, Fetishism, and the Decolonial Alternative

Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism extends from history, ethics, and epistemology into the domain of political philosophy itself. His diagnosis is that liberal democratic theory, social contract thought, and representative institutions are Eurocentric not merely in their historical origins but in their conceptual structure. European political philosophy begins from constituted power—the state, the sovereign, the institutionalized political order—rather than from what Dussel identifies as the constituent power of the people. This inversion renders invisible the popular will-to-live (what Dussel calls "potentia" or "hyperpotentia") that grounds all legitimate political authority. When institutions sever their connection to this constituent power, political authority becomes what Dussel terms "fetishized": it appears as an autonomous force standing above the people rather than as their delegated expression. The totality/exteriority dialectic thus operates politically as the distinction between systems that recognize their dependence on popular will and those that obscure or deny it, positioning critics and victims outside the circle of legitimate political participation.

### 4.1: Potentia, Potestas, and the Fetishism of Power

Herrera Torres, Arias Torres, and Colin Martinez (2016) provide the most systematic Spanish-language exposition of Dussel's fundamental political distinction between "lo politico" (the political, tied to constituent power) and "la politica" (politics, tied to constituted power). The starting point for Dussel's political philosophy is the political power of the community, grounded in rational consensus about the material conditions necessary for corporeal life. This power—potentia or what Dussel calls "poder popular"—does not disappear when institutions are created but persists as the ultimate source of political legitimacy. Constituted power (potestas) is legitimate only insofar as it remains connected to and accountable to this constituent source. The relationship between potentia and potestas is dialectical: institutions are necessary for exercising political power, but they carry the constant risk of autonomization, of severing themselves from the popular will that constitutes them. When this severance occurs, power becomes fetishized—it appears as a thing-in-itself rather than as a relation of delegation and accountability.

Gomez Carbajal (2018) traces the conceptual passage from Marx's critique of commodity fetishism to Dussel's critique of power fetishism, demonstrating the continuity between Dussel's reading of political economy and his political philosophy. Just as commodities under capitalism appear to have value in themselves, obscuring the social relations of labor that produce them, political institutions under fetishized conditions appear to possess authority in themselves, obscuring their dependence on the people's constituent will. The fetishization of power operates through what Dussel identifies as the "invisibilization" of the political community's rational consensus. Representative institutions claim to speak for the people while structurally foreclosing the people's capacity to intervene when those institutions betray their mandate. Liberal democracy, on this analysis, is Eurocentric not because it originated in Europe but because it theorizes political legitimacy from the standpoint of already-constituted institutions rather than from the ongoing constituent power of those who are governed.

Padilla (2023) and Rizzo (2025) examine the theological dimension of Dussel's political philosophy, showing how his critique of Eurocentric political thought engages with and challenges European political theology. Where Schmitt theorizes sovereignty as the power to decide the exception and Agamben analyzes bare life and the state of exception, both operate within what Dussel diagnoses as a theology of domination that sacralizes political power. Against this, Dussel develops a liberationist political theology that centers not sovereignty but the community's will-to-live and the ethical demand of victims. Padilla demonstrates how Dussel's reading of theological metaphors in Marx's Capital provides resources for analyzing how capitalism and colonialism employ religious language—sacrifice, redemption, providence—to justify systemic violence. The fetishization of power thus has a theological dimension: institutions claim a quasi-sacred status that places them beyond popular accountability, constructing challenges to their authority as violations of political order itself.

### 4.2: Transmodernity as Political Project—Internal Debates

The most productive internal debate within scholarship on Dussel's political philosophy concerns the adequacy of his populist framework and whether it can account for the institutional complexity that democratic politics requires. Lozano Suarez (2021) analyzes how Santiago Castro-Gomez appropriates and transforms Dussel's concept of transmodernity to develop what he calls "transmodern republicanism." Castro-Gomez argues that while Dussel correctly diagnoses the fetishization of power in liberal democracy, his politics of liberation lacks the institutional resources to theorize how popular constituent power can be organized in ways that avoid both fetishization and the tyranny of unified popular will. Dussel's framework theorizes "the people" as a unified anti-fetishist force that emerges when the community recognizes institutional betrayal, but it cannot adequately account for disagreement, pluralism, and the need for institutions that mediate between competing visions of the common good. Castro-Gomez proposes republican institutions—civic virtue, public deliberation, rotation of offices—as necessary supplements to Dussel's populist politics.

Camelo (2024) demonstrates that despite this disagreement, transmodernity functions as a convergent point between Dussel and Castro-Gomez. Both reject the adequacy of existing Eurocentric political forms, both insist on centering the perspectives of those excluded from political participation, and both propose dialogue across cultural-political traditions as essential for constructing genuinely democratic institutions. The difference lies in whether republican institutions represent merely another Eurocentric importation (Dussel's worry) or whether they can be appropriated and transformed through the transmodern method (Castro-Gomez's claim). This debate reflects broader tensions in decolonial political thought about whether institutional design can ever be neutral or whether all institutional forms carry the geopolitical markings of their origins.

Diaz Fernandez (2022) provides a critical secular reading of Dussel's entire philosophical trajectory, connecting Castro-Gomez's internal critique to Karl-Otto Apel's earlier challenges about discourse ethics and procedural rationality. He argues that the passage from Dussel's ethics to his politics remains underdeveloped precisely at the point where institutions must be specified: if the material principle of life grounds ethical critique and popular constituent power grounds political legitimacy, what institutional forms allow both to be realized without falling into either liberal fetishization or populist simplification? Diaz Fernandez notes that Horacio Cerutti's early critique of Dussel's populism—that it romanticizes "the people" without accounting for internal heterogeneity and conflict—has not been adequately answered in Dussel's mature political work.

Achenbach (2021) examines the exchange between Paul Ricoeur and his former student Dussel on questions of universality and world-historical agency, revealing how Dussel's political philosophy challenges European assumptions about who can legitimately speak as a historical subject. Ricoeur's concept of the "crisis of the concrete universal in Western Europe" acknowledges Europe's particularity but struggles to theorize how non-European peoples can participate as equals in constructing a genuinely universal political project. Dussel's response is that Europe must recognize that its crisis is not humanity's crisis—that other cultural-political traditions possess their own rational resources for organizing collective life. Yet Achenbach questions whether Dussel's alternative conception of intercultural political dialogue specifies how such dialogue would proceed concretely or whether it remains at the level of philosophical principle.

### 4.3: Comparative Dialogues with European Political Philosophy

Several scholars position Dussel's political philosophy in dialogue with specific European and North American thinkers to assess whether his critique of Eurocentrism generates constructive political alternatives or remains primarily diagnostic. Sager and Spencer (2016) compare Dussel to John Dewey, identifying convergences around democratic inquiry, attention to marginalized perspectives, and the integration of theory with practice. Both thinkers emphasize that political philosophy must begin from concrete problems of exclusion and domination rather than from abstract principles. Yet they also identify a crucial divergence: Dewey's pragmatist fallibilism treats all political claims as provisional and subject to experimental revision, while Dussel's phenomenological starting point—the interpellation by the victim whose life the system denies—grounds political critique in a non-negotiable ethical demand. Sager and Spencer suggest that Dewey's experimental method may be more institutionally feasible than Dussel's framework, but that Dussel corrects Dewey's Eurocentrism by insisting that political philosophy must systematically privilege the perspective of the excluded.

Reynolds (2014) compares Dussel's philosophy of liberation to Richard Rorty's liberal ironism, framing both as utopian political visions that critique existing arrangements while imagining radically different futures. Where Rorty proposes ironic detachment from one's own contingent commitments combined with liberal solidarity, Dussel insists on the ethical necessity of siding with victims and transforming rather than reforming institutions that produce exclusion. Reynolds questions whether these positions are mutually exclusive or whether liberalism and liberation might be brought into productive dialogue. Yet the comparison reveals fundamental incompatibilities: Rorty's liberalism accepts representative democracy and market institutions as the best achievable political forms, precisely the structures Dussel diagnoses as fetishized and Eurocentric.

Coronado Preciado (2018) offers a comprehensive Spanish-language overview of Dussel's politics of liberation as a counter-hegemonic field that retrieves early modern Iberian political theology—particularly Bartolome de Las Casas and Francisco de Vitoria—as resources for decolonial thought. This genealogical move challenges the standard Eurocentric narrative that positions modern political philosophy as originating with Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Dussel argues that Las Casas and Vitoria, writing from the encounter with indigenous American peoples, developed political concepts that question the legitimacy of conquest and affirm the rationality and political agency of non-European societies. Coronado Preciado demonstrates how this retrieval allows Dussel to argue that transmodernity is not an external imposition on European political thought but a return to suppressed traditions within Europe's own history—traditions that were marginalized precisely because they challenged colonial domination.

The secondary literature on Dussel's political philosophy thus reveals both the power and the limits of his critique. The potentia/potestas distinction and the concept of fetishized power provide analytical tools for diagnosing how liberal democratic institutions can become autonomous from popular will. The internal debate with Castro-Gomez represents the most serious challenge to whether Dussel's populist politics can sustain institutional complexity. The comparative dialogues with Dewey, Rorty, and European political theology demonstrate that Dussel's framework opens productive conversations across traditions while maintaining its decolonial commitments. Yet the question of whether transmodernity as a political project specifies determinate institutional alternatives or remains primarily a critical method continues to divide scholars. What unites sympathetic and critical readers is recognition that Dussel's political philosophy extends his Eurocentrism critique to its logical conclusion: if European modernity's myth of universality obscures colonial violence, then European political institutions cannot be assumed as the endpoint of democratic development but must be interrogated from the perspective of those they exclude.

## 5. The Limits of Liberation — Feminist, Internal, and Philosophical Critiques

Reading the secondary literature across Sections 1–4, a pattern emerges: Dussel's account of Eurocentrism is more powerful as a diagnostic framework than as a constructive program, and the critiques most difficult to answer share a common structure. They do not merely object to particular claims but identify tensions in the framework's foundations—in its use of European conceptual tools, its gendering of exteriority, and its idealization of the victim as unified epistemological standpoint. This section draws these threads together rather than repeating the critiques surveyed above.

The philosophically most acute objection is the performative contradiction identified by Vargas (2005) and extended by Chambers (2020). Vargas's formulation is precise: a philosophy that counsels resistance to Eurocentric conceptual frameworks and bases its critical authority on speaking from outside those frameworks cannot coherently rely on Levinas, Hegel, Marx, and Apelian discourse ethics as its primary conceptual vocabulary. The reliance is not peripheral—these European sources are architectonically central to Dussel's project. Timmenga, Van der Zande, and Zwitter (2025) offer the most philosophically sustained defense, arguing that Dussel's "relational universalism" transforms European sources rather than merely adopting them, and that analectics succeeds in grounding universal claims in material human vulnerability without reproducing Eurocentric abstraction. Yet even sympathetic readers do not claim that Vargas's challenge has been fully answered. Chambers (2020) pushes the critique further by arguing that the entire decolonial epistemological project—of which Dussel is a founding figure—depends on an internally inconsistent account of Enlightenment thought: it treats "Western epistemology" as monolithically colonial while ignoring internal diversity and resources for self-correction. Irvine's (2011) more targeted challenge—that Dussel's trans-ontology remains parasitic on the Western ontological categories it claims to transcend—adds an ontological dimension to what is also an epistemological and ethical problem. Whether Dussel's appropriation of European philosophy represents a productive transformation or a self-undermining dependence is the deepest unresolved question in the secondary literature.

Feminist critics have made a distinct but structurally similar argument. Lange (1998), Schutte (1993), Vuola (2000), and Mendoza and Grijalva (2022) observe across four decades that Dussel's account of exteriority and the victim systematically undertheorizes gender and sexuality as constitutive axes of colonial exclusion. This is not an oversight to be remedied by adding a chapter on women; it is a structural gap. The concept of "the victim" in Dussel's ethics—and "the Other" in his epistemology—tends to be figured implicitly as a generic or masculine subject, abstracting from how colonial violence operates through racialized gender hierarchies. Mendoza and Grijalva (2022) demonstrate that this gap persists within the decolonial project as a whole: early formulations of the coloniality of power (Quijano, Dussel) acknowledge race and class but treat gender as secondary or derivative rather than as a constitutive dimension of colonial domination. As they argue, the social pacts underlying both colonial and democratic institutions are structured by gender as fundamentally as by race or class. Until Dussel's framework theorizes how the "coloniality of gender" shapes exteriority from within, his account of who stands outside the Eurocentric totality remains partial.

Internal critics from within decolonial and liberation thought identify a third limitation. Cerutti's early critique—that Dussel's pre-1977 work romanticized "the people" as a unified populist force while obscuring internal heterogeneity and conflict—has been only partially answered by Dussel's mature architectonic (Diaz Fernandez 2022). Castro-Gomez's argument, reconstructed by Lozano Suarez (2021) and Camelo (2024), similarly holds that the potentia/potestas distinction provides insufficient resources for thinking how democratic institutions should be designed to prevent both fetishization and the tyranny of a unified popular will. Camelo (2024) argues persuasively that transmodernity is the convergent point between Dussel and Castro-Gomez, suggesting that these internal disagreements are productive rather than fragmenting. Yet productive disagreement is not resolution, and the institutional deficit—the underdetermination of what transmodern political and epistemological alternatives would look like in practice—remains a genuine limit.

Taken together, the critiques converge on a diagnosis: Dussel's framework is most powerful in its negative moment—identifying how Eurocentrism operates structurally across history, ethics, epistemology, and politics—and less developed in its positive moment—specifying how transmodernity, pluriversality, and the material principle of life generate determinate alternatives. This asymmetry is not a contingent feature of incomplete work but reflects a structural challenge for any philosophy that seeks to think genuinely from the exteriority of the dominant system: the conceptual tools available are inevitably shaped by that system, and the alternatives must be constituted through dialogue with those whose perspectives have been suppressed. Whether this process of transmodern dialogue can generate the determinate philosophical content that Dussel's critics demand is the question that future scholarship must address.

## Conclusion

Enrique Dussel's account of Eurocentrism constitutes one of the most ambitious and systematically developed critiques in twentieth- and twenty-first-century philosophy. Its ambition lies in its scope: Eurocentrism is diagnosed not as a bias confined to particular disciplines or texts but as a structural feature of how European modernity constitutes itself as universal—through the simultaneous acts of colonial domination and philosophical self-legitimation. The totality/exteriority dialectic provides the conceptual architecture through which Dussel organizes his historical, ethical, epistemological, and political critiques. What unifies these domains is the same diagnostic operation: European modernity posits itself as the totality of reason, thereby rendering invisible those who stand outside it, and justifies the violence by which that invisibility is enforced as the necessary cost of civilization and progress.

Dussel's most philosophically distinctive contribution is the material principle of life as the foundation for a non-relativist critique of Eurocentrism. Where critics argue that decolonial epistemology collapses into relativism once it denies the universality of European reason, Dussel proposes corporeal vulnerability—the shared human need for material conditions to sustain and develop life—as a genuinely universal standpoint that is not derived from European philosophical frameworks. The victim's interpellation thus functions simultaneously as ethical demand and epistemological disclosure: those excluded from discourse know, from their position in exteriority, what participants within the system cannot or will not acknowledge about the material violence that makes the system possible. Whether this grounding succeeds—whether corporeal need can bear the universalist weight Dussel assigns it without smuggling in the discourse-ethical assumptions it aims to supersede—is debated but not resolved in the secondary literature.

The most serious unresolved question is the performative tension. Dussel critiques Eurocentrism using Levinas, Marx, Hegel, and discourse ethics. His defenders argue that this represents a productive appropriation that transforms European sources; his critics argue that it instantiates the very Eurocentric dependence his framework diagnoses. The debate with Apel on discourse ethics, Vargas's Eurocentrism Problem, Chambers's systematic critique of decolonial epistemology, and Irvine's ontological challenge all press versions of this objection, and no adequate reply exists in the literature. Whether Dussel's analectic method genuinely transcends the European ontological tradition or remains its internal variant is the deepest philosophical question his work raises.

Feminist scholarship has identified a related structural gap: Dussel's account of exteriority undertheorizes gender and sexuality as constitutive axes of colonial exclusion. The "victim" and the "Other" in Dussel's ethics and epistemology tend to be figured as generic subjects who are implicitly male, abstracting from how colonial violence operates through racialized gender hierarchies. The feminist critiques—spanning Schutte (1993), Lange (1998), Vuola (2000), and Mendoza and Grijalva (2022)—are consistent and cumulative, but a sustained feminist reconstruction of Dussel's framework rather than critique of it remains a gap in the literature.

Future scholarship would benefit from three directions: a systematic comparison of Dussel's account of Eurocentrism with African and Asian decolonial thinkers beyond the Fanon connection that Maldonado-Torres has begun; sustained feminist reconstruction of the ethics and epistemology of liberation that goes beyond critique to constructive revision; and analytic philosophical assessment of whether the material principle of life and the concept of corporeal vulnerability can bear the universalist claims Dussel assigns them—an engagement that Chambers and Irvine have begun but that remains underdeveloped. Dussel's philosophy of liberation has generated a rich and genuinely international secondary literature that takes his diagnoses seriously even when contesting his methods. The debates it has generated—about the universality of European reason, the possibility of non-Eurocentric universalism, the philosophical standing of victims and the excluded—are among the most important in contemporary global philosophy.

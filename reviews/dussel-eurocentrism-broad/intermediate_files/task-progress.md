**Started**: 2026-02-20
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-20

## Progress Status

- [x] Phase 1: Verify environment and determine execution mode
- [x] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains (7 domains → lit-review-plan.md)
- [ ] Phase 3: Research domains sequentially (0/7 complete)
- [ ] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [ ] Phase 5: Write review sections
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Completed Tasks

[2026-02-20] Phase 1: Environment verified. Working directory: reviews/dussel-eurocentrism-broad/
[2026-02-20] Phase 2: 7 domains planned → lit-review-plan.md

## Current Task

Phase 3: Research Domain 1 — Critique of Modernity and the "Myth of Modernity"

## Next Steps

1. Domain 1: Critique of Modernity → literature-domain-1.bib
2. Domain 2: Ethics of Liberation → literature-domain-2.bib
3. Domain 3: Epistemology → literature-domain-3.bib
4. Domain 4: Political Philosophy → literature-domain-4.bib
5. Domain 5: Universalism → literature-domain-5.bib
6. Domain 6: Reception/Critiques → literature-domain-6.bib
7. Domain 7: Comparative Studies → literature-domain-7.bib
8. STOP — present mapping results to user before proceeding to synthesis

## User Constraints

- Sequential agents (not parallel) to reduce usage spikes
- Mapping pass: stop and show user before proceeding to synthesis
- Output dir: reviews/dussel-eurocentrism-broad/
- Source cap: ~60-100 sources in mapping stage
- Prioritise Spanish-language scholarship, then English
- Include Portuguese if central
- Flexible 4-8 clusters emerging from literature

      "abstract": "This paper examines Enrique Dussel\u2019s concept of modernity by offering an intellectual reconstruction of the evolution of his thought and argues that his conception of modernity is not a reductionist idea of Eurocentrism and colonialism. It emphasizes his transdisciplinary approach, spanning from history, economic history, metaphysics, and ethics, providing a rich and unparalleled understanding of modernity. This perspective reveals crucial aspects of the genesis and essence of modernity, as well as key insights to interpret its current state and fate. For this purpose, Dussel\u2019s intellectual trajectory is divided into different phases. For each period, it highlights his primary interlocutors, topics of investigation, and insights about the essence of modernity. In this context, this paper emphasizes the roles of economic history, World-System analysis, and geopolitics in his philosophical project. In short, it argues that Dussel\u2019s theory of modernity operates as a geopolitical turn in philosophy.",

      "abstract": "This article analyzes the work of Walter Benjamin, focusing on his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" and his critique of progress as a central axis of capitalist and socialist modernity. Drawing on the reflections of Bol\u00edvar Echeverr\u00eda and Enrique Dussel, the text argues, from a reading that intertwines Benjamin's Jewish condition and his connection with European culture, that the vision of progress is a historical construction that hides the underlying barbarity in power structures, both in capitalism and in real socialism. When the author proposes his interpretation of history \"against the grain,\" he challenges the linear and triumphalist conception of progress, proposing a historical materialism based on the memory of the oppressed and the redemption of the victims of the past. The work also highlights how Benjamin's critique of modernity, far from being an abstract reflection, has a practical and revolutionary dimension, linking his ideas with Latin American liberation philosophies and the need for a new critical look at history. In this sense, the article argues that theology, in Benjamin's thought, does not propose a doctrine, nor a treatise on God, but rather a critical tool that allows for the interruption of the hegemonic narrative of progress and the reconfiguration of social struggles from a radically new perspective, centered on resistance and the historical transformation of the oppressed.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

      "abstract": "Critical legal thinking is a theme with several sources of foundation, many of them inserted in the context of modern rationality or postmodern rationality.Thus, delimiting the question of the foundation of critical legal thinking, it should be noted that this is architected from the interdisciplinary relationship that characterizes it as critical; For this reason, philosophy and ethics play a fundamental role in consolidating these strands of thought. However, the varied ethical perspectives accompany a development centered on the historical reality in which they are constructed. Therefore, some ethics are forged in the design of modernity as universal, even starting from particular contexts, which become canons for verifying validity and are impinged as truths in all parts of the Western world. This can be exemplified in the centrality and potency of the individual and the selfish society fruit of the Euro-centric modernity. Thus, the central problem that occupies the present reflection is that the ethics underlying the project of modernity have found exhaustion and, along with this, there is the emergence of other critically destabilizing ethical perspectives that present themselves as alternatives.Thus, the ethics of Latin American liberation, elaborated by Enrique Dussel is one of these hypotheses that emerge as a possibility of criticism to modern thought, with the purpose of this text is to verify the potentialities of liberation ethics as legal criticism, specifically analyzing the Materials and categories that help in the reflection and consolidation of a founding ethical proposal. These objectives will be sought through a bibliographical and analytical research, which will privilege an interdisciplinary methodology. Therefore, the present study reveals from the crisis of modernity in its ethical perspective an alternative and critical foundation that contributes with materials to reflect a legal ethic of Latin American liberation.",

      "abstract": "This essay explores the epistemological decolonization of World History and the critique of modernity through a transmodern perspective. It challenges the Eurocentric periodization of history, emphasizing the erasure and misrepresentation of non-European civilizations in the global narrative. By examining the ideological constructs underpinning modernity, capitalism, and colonialism, the essay advocates for a pluriversal approach to knowledge and cultural traditions. It also critiques the inadequacies of postmodernism in addressing systemic inequities, proposing transmodernity as a framework for integrating diverse traditions and fostering dialogue among cultures of the Global South. Through this lens, the essay seeks to redefine the future of humanity and knowledge production.",

      "abstract": "Modern Western philosophy has long excluded Latin America from its historical and conceptual narrative, reinforcing a Eurocentric understanding of historical development. This study aims to challenge that exclusion by analyzing how Enrique Dussel\u2019s philosophy - especially as developed in 1492: El encubrimiento del Otro and Meditaciones anticartesianas - reconstructs the origins of modern subjectivity from a Latin American, decolonial perspective. Through textual analysis of Dussel\u2019s works and comparative readings of canonical European thinkers such as Hegel and Descartes, this research investigates the historical and ontological link between the ego cogito and the ego conquiro . Following a philosophical and critical-historical method, the study combines close exegesis with genealogical reconstruction to identify how the myth of modernity emerged through colonial conquest and philosophical erasure. The results reveal that, according to Dussel, the Cartesian subject - the foundation of modern philosophy - is only made possible through the prior conquest and objectification of the colonial Other. This encounter is not peripheral but constitutive: Latin America and the broader colonial world played a crucial role in the birth of modernity, both economically and philosophically, and ontologically. As highlighted in its conclusions, this study represents only an initial step: a deconstructive phase within the broader tradition of the Philosophy of Liberation. The study calls for the reconstruction of a philosophical canon that acknowledges its colonial foundations and includes the voices it has historically silenced. Ultimately, it argues that decolonizing philosophy, a process that broadly extends from Latin America to the entire peripheral world, is not only possible but also necessary for a more just and inclusive global thought.",

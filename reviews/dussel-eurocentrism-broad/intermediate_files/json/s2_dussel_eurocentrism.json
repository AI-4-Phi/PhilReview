      "abstract": "This paper examines Enrique Dussel\u2019s concept of modernity by offering an intellectual reconstruction of the evolution of his thought and argues that his conception of modernity is not a reductionist idea of Eurocentrism and colonialism. It emphasizes his transdisciplinary approach, spanning from history, economic history, metaphysics, and ethics, providing a rich and unparalleled understanding of modernity. This perspective reveals crucial aspects of the genesis and essence of modernity, as well as key insights to interpret its current state and fate. For this purpose, Dussel\u2019s intellectual trajectory is divided into different phases. For each period, it highlights his primary interlocutors, topics of investigation, and insights about the essence of modernity. In this context, this paper emphasizes the roles of economic history, World-System analysis, and geopolitics in his philosophical project. In short, it argues that Dussel\u2019s theory of modernity operates as a geopolitical turn in philosophy.",

This paper raises the problem of alterity in the decolonial thinking of Enrique Dussel through the hermeneutical exegesis of three main categories: exteriority, living work and victim. The purpose of this research is to determine the continuities and discontinuities of this problem in the theoretical work of the Argentine-Mexican philosopher.\u00a0 As\u00a0our theoretical-methodological framework, we consider the notions of the de-colonial attitude and the Latin American hermeneutic-philosophical approach to liberation. In the conclusions, we show that the concept of alterity appears\u00a0in Dussel's early work\u00a0associated with Levinasian ethical language. Later, a shift towards an economic-material reflection is evidenced in his mature work as a means to historically understand the oppression and exclusion of peripheral countries.",

It explores Dussel's thought about Modernity and refers to the totalization of the Euro-centrical model. In order to deal with what Dussel calls \u00abthe conquering vocation of the system\u00bb, inspiration is found on the Levinasian philosophy of the Other and on an approach to the \u00abasymmetrical problem\u00bb that stresses the need for a post-colonial turn against the empire of Euro-centric reason, while recognizing the Other as a revelatory epiphany. \u00abBecoming critically aware, from the postcolonial world, of Eurocentrism as place of expression of the speech (locus enuntiationis) [which is a] gene-ralized habitus of the thinker, the scientific, the philosopher, and that pene-trates so deeply into the subjectivity of the theoric and in the objectivity of the theories (and social and human sciences) that it is practically impossible to get rid of their widely accepted limitations, and is accepted unanimously by scientific communities, by the theories, by the research projects, and prevents for overcoming its narrow deforming limits\u00bb.69",

This essay highlights its transdisciplinary character and its focus on social, cultural, and epistemic liberation, which aims to construct a critical and propositional reflection on cultural authenticity and the liberation of Latin America. It refers to Enrique Dussel\u2019s project of transmodernity and his philosophical legacy as a key module for the construction of a paradigm of social, cultural, and epistemic liberation. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of propositional thought on cultural authenticity and liberation, highlighting authors such as Francisco Bilbao, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, and An\u00edbal Quijano. The critique of Eurocentrism and the construction of an alternative paradigm based on horizontal intercultural dialogue are also stressed. The essay is structured around three theoretical nuclei that represent important stages of decolonizing thought: the critique of Eurocentrism and the construction of one\u2019s own identity, epistemic decolonization as a tool of liberation, and, finally, intercultural dialogue as an alternative to domination.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the theoretical rupture originated with the epistemological turn in the realm of the sciences produced by Latin American and Latinx theories of decolonization, and its impact on theology. The Epistemological decolonization of Christianity requires the relocation of theological thinking moving its epicenter from imperial Christendom to the oppressed colonial subjectivity. Epistemic decolonization is important not only because it unmasks the racism hidden in the universalistic claims made by Eurocentric epistemologies, along with the distortion it causes, but also because it brings to the fore other knowledges and ways of knowing hitherto made invisible. Dussel identifies the Latino-Germanic Christendom as the spine of Eurocentrism. Therefore, the decolonization of Christian theology is central for the task of decolonization.",

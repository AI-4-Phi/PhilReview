Dussel provides a corrective to Dewey\u2019s Eurocentrism and to his tendency to underplay the challenges of incorporating marginalized populations by insisting that social and political philosophy begin from the perspective of the marginalized and excluded. Simultaneously, Dewey encourages a modest experimental and fallibilist approach to social transformation that promises more feasible social\n          reforms than Dussel\u2019s approach rooted in phenomenology and the critical social sciences",

Over the past\n          fifty years, this debate has been framed in terms of the opposition between advocates of affirmative action who claim that it is needed in order to achieve the integration and\n          participation of traditionally oppressed groups to society without which there is no\n          equality of rights, and critics who argue that affirmative action violates equality by\n          enforcing a double standard that undermines the ideal of a color-blind society. In this\n          paper, I show how the basic principles of Dussel\u2019s ethical theory (which are best\n          expounded in his book Ethics of Liberation) allow us to address what I take to be the\n          main demands of both advocates and critics of affirmative action in a satisfactory way",

Menon\\u27s response (\u201cThe Two \u017di\u017eeks\u201d) suggests that what \u017di\u017eek appears to be missing is knowledge of the fallibility of Eurocentric discourses in negotiating the colonial and postcolonial situations particular to the subcontinent.

Earlier on, questions focused on who was the sovereign of food sovereignty\u2014was it the state? Was it communities? More recently, as there is a growing consensus that there are in fact \u2018multiple sovereignties\u2019 of food sovereignty that cut across jurisdictions and scales, the question has become how these \u2018multiple sovereignties\u2019 are competing with each other in the attempted construction of food sovereignty. This question is becoming all the more relevant as food sovereignty is increasingly getting adopted into state policy at various levels, calling for state and societal actors to redefine their terms of engagement. This study has attempted to explore questions of competing sovereignties, first by developing an analytical framework using the lenses of scale, geography, and institutions, then by applying that framework to Venezuela, where for the past fifteen years a food sovereignty experiment has been underway in the context of a dynamic, complex, and contested shift in state-society relations",

      "abstract": "In a 2006 article, Duncan Kennedy identifies politics as the central dilemma of contemporary legal thought, but affirms that law is non-reducible to politics, which could be read as a partial retraction from the known coda \u201claw is politics.\u201d This essay suggests an interpretation of his refusal to conflate law and politics not in terms of disavowal, or a way of distancing politics from law, but as an attempt to carve out a space from where to think of the relational aspect between law and politics. This becomes necessary due to a current phenomenon which Pierre Schlag calls \u201cdedifferentiation,\u201d where no distinction\u2014and hence no relation\u2014seems to be possible between law and other spheres of life. Opposing that conclusion, this article contends that engendering relations allows us to keep the terms connected in relative motion. The essay then moves to describe four distinct modes of framing the relation between law and politics, which gives rise to very different disciplinary projects: law as politics, dating back to the legal realist movement; law as political science, which finds its current expression in empirical and quantitative research; law as political philosophy, generated by a renewed interest in \u201cthe political\u201d; and law as political contingent, growing out of a similar interest but challenging the boundary-setting ambitions of philosophy. While the latter has not yet been adequately translated into law, I suggest as an alternative the work of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, which declines to grant an aura of invincible ubiquity to any totalizing description, including neoliberalism\u2019s attempt to present itself as a world system.Peer reviewe",

Both concepts mean \u2018community\u2019 or \u2018people,\u2019 and \u2018us/we.\u2019 However, beyond his reference to Carlos Lenkersdorf\u2019s book Filosofar en clave tojolabal (Philosophizing in Tojolabal Code), Dussel delves not further into these Indigenous words and their implications to understand what he means by people. Focusing on the work of Carlos Lenkersdorf (2005), Gladys Tzul Tzul (2018), Alejandra Aquino Moreschi (2013), Ra\u00fal Madrid (2014) and Josef Estermann (2006), I shall examine how the political proceeding of distinct Latin American Indigenous communities, literally changes the manner in which Dussel\u2019s concept of people is understood in non-Indigenous realities. Indeed, among Indigenous peoples, a search for an alternative political system is commonplace. I will examine that search especially in the Tojol ab\u2019al, K\u2019iche\u2019, and Andean instance; and, taking guidance from Dussel\u2019s notion of people, I will examine how there may be a solution to be found in the political participation of the citizenry made by consensus. This political resolution may, in turn, be instrumental in the creation of a new notion of the \u2018we\u2019 in non-Indigenous realities",

While the U&amp;CD scholars have made valuable contributions to anti-Eurocentric IR scholarship, this article argues that U&amp;CD has analytical limitations that impede its anti-Eurocentric potential. These limitations derive from U&amp;CD\u2019s reliance on the concepts of \u2018development\u2019 and the \u2018whip of external necessity\u2019, which require developmental ranking of societies and lock U&amp;CD into a state-centric social ontology. To provide complementary conceptual resources to overcome U&amp;CD\u2019s analytical limitations, this article introduces Enrique Dussel\u2019s liberation philosophy (LP), which can incorporate peoples other than states as agents and entities of global politics through its concept of \u2018exteriority\u2019. U&amp;CD and LP are then jointly applied to analyse the relations between the Nordic states and the indigenous S\u00e1mi people to assess the approaches\u2019 relative strengths and weaknesses and identify synergies between them. Based on this assessment, the article outlines the potential for synthesising a \u2018thin\u2019 version of U&amp;CD with LP, by using the concept of \u2018exteriority\u2019 to reorient U&amp;CD\u2019s analytical focus towards people excluded by the states-system",

      "abstract": "Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, charismatic and iconic, is a product of his time and can only be understood within the context of the social movements that he belonged to and led. Thus, this article locates Mandela within the local and global context in which he emerged while at the same time making sense of his instrumental interventions and nationalist humanist vision of life, peace and justice. This article situates Mandela\u2019s political life within the broader context of the third humanist revolution, which was a response to the inimical processes of racism, enslavement and colonisation. In its centenary celebration of Mandela, the article re-articulates how he embodied alternative politics founded on the will to live as opposed to the will to power; the paradigm of peace as opposed to the paradigm of war; political justice as opposed to criminal justice; as well as pluriversality as opposed to tragic notions of racial separate development known as apartheid. What is fleshed out is a \u2018Mandela phenomenon\u2019 as founded on strong progressive politics albeit predicated on the unstable idea of the potential of advocates and victims of apartheid undergoing a radical metamorphosis amenable to the birth of a new pluriversal society.Keywords: Nelson Mandela, nationalist humanism, politics of life, paradigm of peace, pluriversality, South Afric",

      "abstract": "Transmodernity is a new philosophical paradigm that transcends the modern foundational ethos and as well differs from the postmodern critique. It is basically a call towards a just social order that gives priority to human life. It is inherently ethical and fundamentally liberational. This work looks into the insufficiency of Modern Ethiopian establishment in attaining an inclusive and pluralist arrangement. It assumes this establishment as a hegemonic totality that marginalizes its others. It argues that the Modern Ethiopian establishment is an ontologic totality that needs to be liberated and transformed. Based on Dussel\u2019s Philosophy and Ethics of Liberation, Transmodern Ethiopia is anticipated as an entity that could transcend the Modern and come up with a different arrangement. This would be an ethical arrangement which accepts the other as other. The three principles of Ethics of Liberation (material principle, formal principle and feasibility principle) are used as an ethical framework for the construction.Key words: Transmodernity, Liberation philosophy, Analectic, Ethics of Liberation, Modern Ethiopia, Transmodern Ethiopia, Pluriversal polylogu",

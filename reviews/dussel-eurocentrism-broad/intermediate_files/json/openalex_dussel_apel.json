      "abstract": "Enrique Dussel is Latin America\u2019s foremost philosopher, renowned for his contributions to ethics, political philosophy, and liberation theology. Designed for classroom use, this collection of essays engages with Dussel\u2019s encyclopedic work, making his valuable contributions accessible to English-speaking students. In addition to being one of the most original, prolific, and widely known members of the Latin American Philosophy of Liberation movement, Dussel has also made important contributions to world philosophy, the history of philosophy, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and the understanding of Karl Marx. Dussel famously engaged in a decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel on the relationship between material and formal ethics\u2014that is, between an ethics of the community of life and an ethics of the community of discourse\u2014and he has produced novel interpretations and analyses of the concepts of alterity, exteriority, the other, and the world history of ethical systems. Most recently, Dussel extended his work on an ethics of liberation into a politics of liberation, developed over the course of three published volumes. In this book, scholars from around the world assess Dussel\u2019s work in ways that are both appreciative and critical. Two essays by Dussel bookend the volume: the collection opens with a consideration of the (im)possibility of multiple modernities and ends with an autobiographical trajectory of the philosopher\u2019s thinking. In addition to Dussel and the editors, the contributors to this volume include Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff, Don Thomas Deere, Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, Mario S\u00e1enz Rovner, Alejandro A. Vallega, and Jorge Z\u00fa\u00f1iga M.",

      "abstract": "The paper examines the current debates regarding the grounding of human rights in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. It analyses the challenges which come today from certain policies of human rights which instrumentalize them under the pretext of a \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d and redefi ne them in terms of democracy promotion and regime change, as well as those challenges which come from ideologies which question the core principles of human rights and provoke the so called \u201ccrisis of legitimization.\u201d The paper argues for the necessity of restoring the genuine meaning of human rights and of the role of citizens in striving for their implementation. At the heart of the analysis is Kant\u2019s concept of human rights as freedom. With Kant as its backdrop, the paper shows that the claim that religious worldviews provide the only intelligible foundation, as in Nicholas Wolterstorff, faces serious challenges in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. The paper then analyzes the non-religious philosophical concepts which seek to develop an account of human rights that does not depend upon controversial metaphysical or religious doctrines. It examines an account of human rights from the perspective of discourse ethics as developed by Karl-Otto Apel and J\u00fcrgen Habermas. It also analyses the concepts of human dignity and \u201cemerging morality\u201d by Arturo Roig and the \u201cethics of liberation\u201d by Enrique Dussel. The analysis shows the ongoing relevance of Kant\u2019s ideas and their recent development by the theorists of discourse ethics and of dialogical and democratic cosmopolitanism. Key words: human rights, freedom, dignity, cosmopolitanism, Kant.",

      "abstract": "Liberation philosophy, as a Latin American project for critical thought, is one among many expressions of a shift in global power dynamics and in epistemic perspective that has taken place since the Second World War.*The European crisis, or more than a crisis, its own internal devastation after the war, opened at least three paths for the train of history and thought.On the one hand, the United States -which had proven itself as an international power through the expansion from the thirteen colonies, the war with Mexico, and the Spanish-American War -became after the Second World War a hegemonic force that would both assist and displace Northwestern Europe as the power-axis of the modern world-system.With this, Americanism -the triumphalist and assimilationist ideology of the United States which had already burst onto the scene with Theodore Roosevelt in the late nineteenth century -was decisively introduced to the rest of the world.This Americanist discourse would dictate the terms for the assimilation of non-Catholic European immigrants, some of which were seen as belonging to darker races. 1 This ideology has taken various turns with McCarthyism and Reagan in the context of the Cold War, and today it takes on a new spirit in formulations like that offered by Samuel P. Huntington, who has forcefully rearticulated Americanism with respect to immigrants and ethnic minorities in the United States. 2 But today, after the Cold War and the attacks of 11 September, it is no longer European immigrants that allegedly pose a \"challenge\" to U.S.-American identity, but rather Latin American (im)migrants, particularly Spanish-speaking Mexicans and Chicana/os. 3 There is, accordingly, a particular importance today for exploring the decolonial potential of those cultural forms originating in Latin America, Mexico, and in the borderlands between Mexico and the United States, among other \"frontier\" territories both to the north and south of this border. 4e second path that opened with the decline of Europe was, clearly, that of the Cold War rival of Americanism: Soviet communism.Soviet communism, or at least socialism (which is a different but related political system/ideology), would become for many a viable option for a different future, beyond both fascist and liberal Europe.Europe itself would come to be divided between these two newly regnant ideologies and neo-imperial geo-political projects.Other regions also suffered the force of this clash of political projects, while many nations tried to find a space between or in alliance with the two dominant blocs.Now, the decline of Europe opened a third path, which we will call -following Frantz Fanon -that of the \"wretched of the earth,\" as well as the \"de-colonial turn.\" 5 This door would be definitively forced open through the combination of the internal and external devastation of Europe, that is to say, not only by the perverse force of Nazism in its interior but also by the encouraging force of the decolonization of European territories abroad.In contrast to the Latin American liberation struggles of the nineteenth century, which took place in a context in which the weakening of Southern Europe left intact the fascination with the increasing strength of Northern Europe (especially France and England), mid-twentieth century Europe was destroyed by Nazism and completely demoralized.As the",

      "abstract": "After considering the proper tone for my participation in this \"dialogue\" between Europeans and Latin Americans about \"Critical Theory,\" I have concluded that my argumentative strategy should primarily be to take seriously the \"subjects\" of the dialogue and their locus enuntiationis: who we are and from where we speak.These sorts of dialogues are not frequent nor are their terms obvious, 1 and it is even less common for such a debate to occur symmetrically, by which I mean that it takes place between philosophers within a community of horizontal communication who are respected as equals, as colleagues, but who nevertheless demand to be recognized in their alterity.Such efforts are not exempt from a certain degree of incommunicability and incommensurability that can create misunderstandings, but are nonetheless united by a solidaristic will to attempt to advance a critical philosophy with global validity.Such a philosophy, which would accordingly set out from the perspective of those excluded from the global system (peripheral countries) and those excluded within particular states (impoverished masses), has not existed to date: I consider its construction the specific task of philosophy in this twenty-first century that we are beginning. The first contacts with the Frankfurt School (with the \"first generation\")As for myself, I participate in what we have called the \"Philosophy of Liberation,\" 2 which since its origin has maintained a constant dialogue with Critical Theory.Just as the events of Paris '68 did not have the same meaning as those in Berkeley, the Latin American context was equally distinct. 3 Paradoxically, under military dictatorships (imposed by the Pentagon and the Kissinger Doctrine between 1964 and 1984), the works of Marcuse -and especially One-Dimensional Mancame to influence us within a context that was similar to the totalitarian horror under which the first Frankfurt School was born (the \"first generation\").The \"dirty war\" which led to the murder, torture, and disappearance of thousands would last almost two decades (as in Brazil, for example). 4 But along with Marcuse, we read the Martinican Frantz Fanon's Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth, 1961), since our reflections were situated in the post-colonial periphery, in the global South.Moreover, our reference point was critical social science -like Dependency Theory, which was later continued by Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory.This global structure of inequality finally burst onto the scene since the Clinton administration under the name of \"globalization\" (which passed from a period characterized by the internationalization of the productive part of capital -as transnational corporations -to a financial and monetarist era with global implications).The point of all this is the following: our first lesson in Critical Theory was non-Eurocentric.My 1975 work Philosophy of Liberation begins thus:From Heraclitus to Karl von Clausewitz and Kissinger, \"war is the origin of everything,\" if by \"everything\" one understands the order or system that the world dominators control by their power and armies [...] I am trying, then, to take space, geopolitical space, seriously.To be born at the North Pole or in Chiapas is not the same thing as to be born in New York City. 5 Through the first Frankfurt School, we discovered \"materiality\" in the sense of living corporeality, a question that does not frequently interest those dealing with the theoretical positions of the School 6 : \"Whoever resigns himself to life without any rational reference to self-preservation would, according to the Enlightenment -and Protestantism -regress to prehistory.\" 7 \"Materiality,\" for the Frankfurt School, consists of an affirmation of living corporality (Leiblichkeit) as in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, which is vulnerable and has desires (Freud), and which needs food, clothing, and shelter (Feuerbach).This anthropological materiality, a far cry from Soviet dialectical materialism, was perceptibly close to our situation in an impoverished, starving, and suffering Latin America.In the Southern Cone, the multitude of demonstrations shouted: \"bread, peace, and work!\" three necessities that refer strictly to life, to the reproduction of its corporeal content (Leiblichkeit).For that reason, the political-economic sphere had a special relevance for us, as did the need for a frontal critique of capitalism (Marx).Will, affectivity and emotions, unconscious drives, and economic requirements were all integrated into the discourse of the first Frankfurt School.But its subject was a \"negative\" materiality, focusing especially on the negative effects of the dominant system, its pain and misery.The \"positivity\" of the system always obscures the \"negativity\" over which it is constructed: \"Hence the convergence of specific materialism with criticism, with social change in practice [...] to abolish suffering.The telos of such an organization or society would be to negate the physical suffering of even the least of its members.\" 8\"Philosophy of Liberation\" set out from the locus enuntiationis of the material victim, from the negative effect of authoritarianism, capitalism, and patriarchy.However, this is the root of a profound divergence with Critical Theory that continues up to the present (and which should be an explicit subject of our dialogue), that of the material negativity of colonialism (of the indigenous peoples, the African slave, the Opium Wars in China, etc.), a phenomenon which corresponds to metropolitan capitalism, Modernity, and Eurocentrism.The victim for us was no longer -as for Horkheimer, Habermas, or the \"third generation\" of Critical Theory -only the worker, the persecuted Jew in Auschwitz, the citizen under Nazism, women, or the working world facing the crisis of the welfare state.We were equally concerned with the victims of a global system (a globalized World-System 9 since 1492), which included the Latin American hacienda system that exploited indigenous people, the mita system of indigenous slave labor which extracted silver (colonial capitalism's first global currency) from mines like that at Potosi in Bolivia, the plantations of African slaves brought to tropical America, the Indian women forced to serve as concubines for the conquistador, the children brought up with Christianity (cultural domination through foreign religion), etc.It was in this context that the ontological category of Totality 10 -so important for Hegel,",

For Horacio Cerutti Guldberg, Ofelia Schutte, and Santiago Castro-Gomez, Dussel\u2019s invocation of a we-subject among the poor, indeed, his very reference to macro-identities such as \u201cthe poor, women, blacks, and Indians,\u201dreturns us to a modernist meta-narrative. And the problem with this meta-narrative is that it works to reify and fetishize the evident symptoms of disciplinary structures of representation, playing into the hands of such constituting structures, that is, rather than deconstructing them. As Castro-Gomez has put it, \u201cWith this, Dussel creates a second reduction: that of converting the poor in some kind of transcendent subject, through which Latin American history will find its meaning. This is the opposite side of postmodernity, because Dussel attempts not to de-centralize the Enlightened subject, but to replace it by another absolute subject\u201d(Critica 39-40; quoted in Dussel,\u201cPhilosophy\u201d338).",

Likewise, later on, constructivism and sociocultural psychology evidenced the relevant role of the students' activity in their learning processes. Last, other theoretical frameworks such as sociology, linguistics, critical pedagogy, etc., have insisted on the need to involve the students in their own educational processes. Along these lines, the contributions of Habermas and Freire have had important repercussions on teaching practices, where dialogical aspects are transformed into an essential feature and component of the processes to build knowledge, the individual and society. The present article addresses the dialogical participation of university students assuming the clear commitment of the university in the education of critical professionals committed to society and the world in which we live.",

Relevant disciplinary perspectives on global English are examined in this light, including superdiversity, translanguaging, translingual practice, trans-spatiality, language commodification, World Englishes and English as a Lingua Franca. Global English and Political Economy presents an original historical and interdisciplinary interpretation of the global ascent of English, while also raising important theoretical and practical questions for perspectives which suggest that the time of the traditional models of English is past.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nProviding an introduction to key theoretical perspectives in political economy, this book is essential reading for advanced students and researchers in applied linguistics, World Englishes and related fields of study.",

As\u00ed, esa Ley establece qui\u00e9nes tienen acceso al derecho a la restituci\u00f3n y a la reparaci\u00f3n (simb\u00f3lica o econ\u00f3mica), y de esta forma define un nuevo universo de v\u00edctimas, con lo que ha ampliado el debate acerca de la noci\u00f3n de v\u00edctima, no solo como una categor\u00eda jur\u00eddica claramente definida en la Ley, sino como un concepto que caracteriza y delimita a determinados tipos de sujeto. Este art\u00edculo contribuye a la discusi\u00f3n que abri\u00f3 la Ley 1448 acerca de la significaci\u00f3n y resignificaci\u00f3n de la noci\u00f3n de v\u00edctima, y de las din\u00e1micas de subjetivaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica que a\u00fan se generan en torno a este proceso sociojur\u00eddico y pol\u00edtico.",

El despojo sutil o violento de los territorios con alto potencial de recursos naturales es una astucia ms del modelo neoliberal para paliar su crisis estructural; tal como sucede contra los pueblos indgenas. Estas acciones son altamente perturbadoras de las dinmicas de organizacin social, y de la agudizacin de injusticia ambiental. Sin embargo, diversos grupos sociales estn reconfigurando sus estrategias no solo para resistir, sino para la construccin de alternativas. El ethos comunitario (comunalidad) -como un elemento cultural propio de los pueblos con ascendencia de la cultura mesoamericana-es una de estrategia intercultural fundamental para estas tareas. La nocin de resiliencia social se usa como herramienta analtica de tal exploracin. Se destaca que los grados de resiliencia de las comunidades estn relacionados con la construccin de procesos autonmicos.",

El an\u00e1lisis se hace a partir del hecho de la conquista de Am\u00e9rica por parte de los europeos. El objetivo de la conquista es adquirir territorios, y al mismo tiempo, colonizar al ind\u00edgena de Am\u00e9rica no s\u00f3lo f\u00edsicamente, sino ideol\u00f3gicamente. Este tema corresponde a uno de los aspectos que conforman la filosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n de Enrique Dussel.El objetivo de este escrito es demostrar que la constituci\u00f3n del ego conquiro es el punto de partida, el inicio del proceso de constituci\u00f3n del victimario en sujeto. Es de vital importancia, para poder abordar la liberaci\u00f3n de la v\u00edctima, hablar sobre c\u00f3mo el victimario se constituye en sujeto desde la dial\u00e9ctica de la dominaci\u00f3n. La racionalidad del ego conquiro genera pr\u00e1cticas que desembocan en la generaci\u00f3n de v\u00edctimas. El art\u00edculo se desarrollar\u00e1 en cuatro partes. La primera explica en qu\u00e9 consiste el proceso de constituci\u00f3n del ego conquiro. La segunda hace referencia, a consecuencia de ese proceso, a la relaci\u00f3n dial\u00e9ctica descubrimiento-encubrimiento del otro que obliga a preguntarnos por la dial\u00e9ctica racionalidad-irracionalidad. La tercera plantea el problema de la colonizaci\u00f3n y el eurocentrismo como elementos propios del ego conquiro. Finalmente, la Conclusi\u00f3n recoger\u00e1 las afirmaciones trabajadas y se centrar\u00e1 en la cr\u00edtica a la afirmaci\u00f3n de Enrique Dussel: \u201cel ego conquiro es el inicio de la modernidad.TEOR\u00cdA Y PRAXIS a\u00f1o 16, No.32, Enero-Mayo de 2018, pp.13-27",

As the Brazilian A-M authors point out, the distinction between North/South M is irrelevant; what is relevant is a coherent pluriversal A-M attitude. In this paper, we honor and disseminate the Brazilian original body of knowledge on OS and introduce an OS agenda that is liberated from M.",

      "abstract": "Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicization and its relation to and interaction with spatialization and temporalization is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIn this essay, we aim to delineate elements of the Habermas and Hannah Arendt theories about the division between public, private and social spheres, as well as about communicative action in Habermas, in an attempt to convey transpositions of these concepts into the field of organizations. The analysis of the basics of Habermasian construction allows us to take a direct look at the delimitation of the field of interactions and the adoption of linguistic categories of analysis directed to the individual in the environment. Our argument is that the analysis of language in the world of life, for Habermas, means questioning what has not been receiving attention and \"discovering\" what is hidden in the linguistic universe of human interaction and intention.Keywords: Public sphere.

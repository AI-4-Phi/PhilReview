      "abstract": "In recent decades, thinkers like Alain Badiou, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, and Giorgio Agamben have argued for a serious political engagement with early Christian thought and its emphasis on collectivity and community. Notwithstanding their important theoretical contributions, these writers often remain within a limited Eurocentric framework, foreclosing the possibility of a truly decolonial political theology. Crucially, their relatively recent reappraisals tend to ignore important precursors of Christian Marxism from the Global South, namely liberation theology and the philosophy of liberation, as elaborated by the Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel. This essay contextualizes Dussel\u2019s liberational thought in the contexts of political theology and literary representation. It pays particular attention to Dussel\u2019s study of the Theological Metaphors of Marx by synthesizing a model of literary inquiry based on his philosophy and applying it to a reading of counter-hegemonic poetry by the Caribbean poet Pedro Mir, namely his long poem \u201cCountersong to Walt Whitman.\u201d This reading makes explicit the implicit theological dimension of Mir\u2019s poetic text. Finally, the essay conceptualizes this interpretive model as a poetics of liberation: a mode of engagement with mutually determining discourses \u2013 politics, poetics, aesthetics \u2013 as well as a mode of reading which unravels the transformation of these discourses in lyrical forms. Writing from the periphery of the US empire, Mir therefore constructs a mode of address which arms itself with both political and theological discourses, however implicitly. To the empire\u2019s miraculous state of exception, Mir counterpoises a redemptive state of rebellion.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

This essay places Goswami\u2019s critique within a context of \u201cthe thought from outside,\u201d which, beginning with Foucault\u2019s reading of Blanchot, continuing through the geopolitics of Dussel\u2019s philosophy of liberation, and prominent in Catherine Malabou\u2019s conceptualization of plasticity, demonstrates how political critiques of philosophical hegemony contain an implicit theorization of \u201cliterature.\u201d If \u201cliterature\u201d gives voice to the thought from outside, does it in turn \u201cdecolonize\u201d philosophy? If so, what itinerary of thought ought to follow the relationship between this literary decolonization of philosophy and its imbrication within the fold of philosophical thought? How to conceptualize the plastic relation between inside and outside, between center and periphery, without subordinating the latter to the hegemony of the former? This essay argues for a coherence between Goswami\u2019s and Malabou\u2019s materialist understandings of difference and a conceptualization of literature as an \u201coutside\u201d to philosophy that operates \u201cexcentrically\u201d \u201cinside\u201d philosophy.",

In the first part, we explore the theological-political thoughts from key thinkers of this area, such as Saint Augustine, Giorgio Agamben, Karl Marx, Enrique Dussel, and Boaventura de Souza Santos. In the light of these authors, in the second part of this article, we describe the emergence of political-theologies in the Brazilian political scenario and sociocultural dynamics, manifested among evangelical groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic situation shed light on many contradictions of Brazilian society and evidenced controversies between two lines of divergent evangelical political theologies: the conservative/antidemocratic and the progressive ones. The re-emergence of these political theologies holds relevant effects regarding the responses of social groups and actions of power in the face of public health problems, which deserve greater attention of the Collective Health field. They influence the spheres of power and sociocultural dynamics in terms of health-disease-care, contributing with collective protection measures and/or encouraging risky, negligent and denialist postures. We conclude by problematizing epistemological contributions to a renewed production of knowledge-action regarding the interface between political theology and Collective Health.",

Synthesizing a half-century of his pioneering work in moral and political philosophy, Dussel presents a succinct rationale for the development of political alternatives to the exclusionary, exploitative institutions of neoliberal globalization. In twenty short, provocative theses he lays out the foundational elements for a politics of just and sustainable coexistence. Dussel first constructs a theory of political power and its institutionalization, taking on topics such as the purpose of politics and the fetishization of power. He insists that political projects must criticize or reject as unsustainable all political systems, actions, and institutions whose negative effects are suffered by oppressed or excluded victims. Turning to the deconstruction or transformation of political power, he explains the political principles of liberation and addresses matters such as reform and revolution.\n\nTwenty Theses on Politics is inspired by recent political transformations in Latin America. As Dussel writes in Thesis 15, regarding the liberation praxis of social and political movements, \u201cThe winds that arrive from the South\u2014from Nestor Kirchner, Tabare Vasquez, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Evo Morales, Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, and so many others\u2014show us that things can be changed. The people must reclaim sovereignty!\u201d Throughout the twenty theses Dussel engages with Latin American thinkers and activists and with radical political projects such as the World Social Forum. He is also in dialogue with the ideas of Marx, Hegel, Habermas, Rawls, and Negri, offering insights into the applications and limits of their thinking in light of recent Latin American political thought and practice.",

The findings reveal three central obstacles: 1) Kant\u2019s Eurocentric conception of the nation-state, which disregards Latin American communal structures; 2) the underestimation of socioeconomic inequalities as drivers of conflict; and 3) the tension between cosmopolitan law and the legal pluralism practiced in the region. In response, the article argues that peace in Latin America demands a hybrid model integrating Kantian universal ethical principles with local practices of social justice and conflict resolution, drawing on theorists such as \u00c1ngel Papacchini and Enrique Dussel. This work contributes to intercultural political philosophy by a) exposing the limits of Kantian liberalism in non-Western contexts; b) proposing a theoretical bridge between universalism and decoloniality; and c) offering pathways to shift from an imposed liberal peace to one rooted in struggles for dignity and regional\nautonomy.

      "abstract": "The article explores how phenomenology, particularly in the context of Latin America, can become a liberating tool by questioning colonial structures of thought and creating an intercultural dialogue that respects diverse worldviews. Latin America has historically been a site of oppression and marginalization, from colonialism to neoliberalism, and this legacy of subjugation has fueled a philosophy aimed not only at understanding but also at transforming this reality.\nPhenomenology, with its focus on lived experience and Husserl's phenomenological reduction (epoch\u00e9), enables questioning Eurocentric frameworks and recovering marginalized forms of knowledge and life. From this perspective, the \u00a0\u201clifeworld \u201c (Lebenswelt) is not singular but plural, adapting to the experiences and contexts of each culture. Authors such as Ra\u00fal Fornet-Betancourt and Enrique Dussel propose a phenomenology that confronts cultural colonialism and promotes an ethical and political recognition of the oppressed \u00a0\u201cOther \u201c (the indigenous person, the peasant, the marginalized woman) allowing for a dialogue where these peoples are neither assimilated nor instrumentalized.\nThe intercultural philosophy emerging here does not seek a homogeneous universality but rather a plurality that preserves cultural identities and acknowledges their contributions. Phenomenology thus enables the construction of \u00a0\u201cconviviality \u201c or harmonious coexistence in a \u00a0\u201cpluriverse, \u201c where all worldviews and ways of life have a place. This approach not only challenges modernity and Eurocentrism but also proposes the need to build social and political relationships that go beyond individual interests, promoting an ethic of coexistence and complementarity. In sum, the proposed intercultural philosophy seeks to decolonize thought and position Latin America within a space of dialogue and resistance to the dominant world-system",

More than an object of study, the present work locates Maya culture as a living historical subject, underlining its cosmovision, community - based practices and ways of resisting modern colonial structures. From an ethical perspective grounded in alterity, this article argues that the cultural practices of living Maya communities constitute a critical and emancipatory source for the ongoing construction of a broader alternative civilizational horizon in Latin America. Furthermore, it reflects on contemporary forms of Maya fetishism and on the need for intercultural politics in the Yucatan Pen\u00ednsula aimed at strengthening cultural and community autonomy.",

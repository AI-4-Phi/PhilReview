      "abstract": "In recent decades, thinkers like Alain Badiou, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, and Giorgio Agamben have argued for a serious political engagement with early Christian thought and its emphasis on collectivity and community. Notwithstanding their important theoretical contributions, these writers often remain within a limited Eurocentric framework, foreclosing the possibility of a truly decolonial political theology. Crucially, their relatively recent reappraisals tend to ignore important precursors of Christian Marxism from the Global South, namely liberation theology and the philosophy of liberation, as elaborated by the Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel. This essay contextualizes Dussel\u2019s liberational thought in the contexts of political theology and literary representation. It pays particular attention to Dussel\u2019s study of the Theological Metaphors of Marx by synthesizing a model of literary inquiry based on his philosophy and applying it to a reading of counter-hegemonic poetry by the Caribbean poet Pedro Mir, namely his long poem \u201cCountersong to Walt Whitman.\u201d This reading makes explicit the implicit theological dimension of Mir\u2019s poetic text. Finally, the essay conceptualizes this interpretive model as a poetics of liberation: a mode of engagement with mutually determining discourses \u2013 politics, poetics, aesthetics \u2013 as well as a mode of reading which unravels the transformation of these discourses in lyrical forms. Writing from the periphery of the US empire, Mir therefore constructs a mode of address which arms itself with both political and theological discourses, however implicitly. To the empire\u2019s miraculous state of exception, Mir counterpoises a redemptive state of rebellion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This theoretical essay presents an overview of the field of political theology as an important part of political philosophy, demonstrates its relevance in the current Brazilian social and political scenario, and problematizes its intersections to the Collective Health field. In the first part, we explore the theological-political thoughts from key thinkers of this area, such as Saint Augustine, Giorgio Agamben, Karl Marx, Enrique Dussel, and Boaventura de Souza Santos. In the light of these authors, in the second part of this article, we describe the emergence of political-theologies in the Brazilian political scenario and sociocultural dynamics, manifested among evangelical groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic situation shed light on many contradictions of Brazilian society and evidenced controversies between two lines of divergent evangelical political theologies: the conservative/antidemocratic and the progressive ones. The re-emergence of these political theologies holds relevant effects regarding the responses of social groups and actions of power in the face of public health problems, which deserve greater attention of the Collective Health field. They influence the spheres of power and sociocultural dynamics in terms of health-disease-care, contributing with collective protection measures and/or encouraging risky, negligent and denialist postures. We conclude by problematizing epistemological contributions to a renewed production of knowledge-action regarding the interface between political theology and Collective Health.",

It suggests that to understand Agamben\u2019s trans secular reaction to late neoliberalism we need historicized his thought. As historicized, it can reveal the dialectical limits of neoliberalism. To do so, the article reads late Agamben texts next to contemporary Marxist thinkers Alenka Zupan\u010di\u010d and her theory of comedy, Todd McGowan and his analysis of Capitalism and desire and Sianne Ngai and her conceptualization of zaniness as the aesthetic representation of neoliberal precariousness. Moving on, the article focuses on Agamben\u2019s late book Pulcinella. It argues that the book not only expresses the limits of neoliberalism but also uncovers hope and promises for comic theological renewal beyond neoliberalism and its cult of the self.",

      "abstract": "Power and its sources have always been essential questions for political philosophy. One of the ways to legitimize power is political theology which was discussed at length during the XX century. The proposed paper considers Christian political theology as a project constructed by Carl Schmitt and Giorgio Agamben. Both thinkers defended their models and criticized their main \u201cenemy\u201d, Erik Peterson. While Schmitt believed in Christian legitimization for the status quo and Agamben dreamed of the coming community without an identity, Peterson argued that Christian doctrines (Trinity, Parousia, etc.) deem any political authority meaningless. A majority of researchers scrutinized and critically evaluated the level of theoretical arguments of the aforementioned thinkers. On the contrary, we have chosen to analyze all of the key and referenced theologians (Paul, Eusebius, Eunomius, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine) to prove that Schmitt-Agamben\u2019s notion of Christian political theology is controversial. Like Peterson with Eusebius, Schmitt and Agamben employed loose translations in trying to integrate their ideas (sovereignty, absolute anarchy) into original Christian texts. The detailed analysis allows the paper to deliver a kind of negative conclusion that Christian political theology has no ground in the sources these thinkers have credited. Nevertheless, our research calls for a new round of discussion: was this critique caused by Christian sources selected inappropriately by Schmitt, Peterson, and Agamben, or by the essential incompatibility between Christianity and political theology? Polemics might get a new \u201cpositive\u201d horizon with the help of this question.",

Although the film underperformed commercially, it thrived institutionally, excerpted in newsreels and rebroadcast annually on October 12 as a ritual object of state culture. The article argues that spectacle in Francoist Spain functioned not only as propaganda but also as a mechanism for stabilizing power by shaping collective memory and everyday habits, revealing how aesthetic form can naturalize political authority and offering a model for analyzing the everyday workings of power across media and regimes.",

However, it has also overshadowed the independently original contributions of his two primary theoretical sources, Carl Schmitt and Walter Benjamin. In this article, I argue that Agamben\u2019s political defeatism can be traced back to a double misconception in his reception of these two authors: first a formalistic reduction of Schmitt, and second a Schmittian reduction of Benjamin. Through this reduction to juridical formalism, the radicality of Benjamin\u2019s historical materialist critique is replaced by a messianic nihilism, leading to the colonization of society by the logic of the concentration camp. Though Agamben\u2019s theory of sovereignty and its implications for a positive political project have been contested, this origin of the decline of radical philosophy has not previously undergone a systematic critique.",

Readers like Agamben have raised the need to investigate whether Peterson himself tried to extend or substantiate his critique. Albeit in scattered reflections, Peterson developed a genealogy of the nation-state through the ambiguity of the angelic and its relation to empire. This article presents these reflections according to the systematic connections Peterson discerns across three categories: the denial of God, the claim of human rights, and linguistic unity. Throughout, attention is paid to how Peterson\u2019s ideas resemble those in Schmitt\u2019s works, though he often adds his own accents through the concepts of Trinitarian and eschatological thought. The result is a nuanced conception of Peterson\u2019s appreciation of Schmitt\u2019s genealogical methodology. It clarifies how Peterson\u2019s envisaged the Trinity as a political-theological paradigm becomes more intelligible. His insistence on openness to the transcendent can be linked to negative political theology.",

Within the framework of the study, the author draws on the theoretical research of some important European political thinkers of the 20th century for the purpose of interpretation. The means for interpreting Schmitt's doctrine are the ideas of the modern Italian thinker Giorgio Agamben, who develops Schmitt's ideas about sovereign power and state of exception in his extensive project Homo sacer. The novelty of the article lies in the formation of a system of ideas about the main categories of political theology in the light of Schmitt\u2019s and Agamben\u2019s intellectual projects. As a result, the author draws conclusions about the eschatological essence of political theology, the binary nature of sovereignty, the messianic significance of the sovereign and its decision, and links it with the geopolitical concept of nomos of the Earth.",

      "abstract": "This study offers a new perspective on the work of Italian theorist Giorgio Agamben, arguing that his recent engagements with the Christian tradition can be productively interpreted as a kind of political theology. As a way of making this claim, I place Agamben in dialogue with German Catholic theologian Johann Baptist Metz, as perhaps the clearest analogue in recent political theology, examining their shared genealogical roots in Marxist philosophy and the Frankfurt School, as well their mutual interests in early\u2010Christian and medieval apocalyptic. Furthermore, I argue that their respective projects can mutually inform one another, and together be regarded as a corrective to certain aspects of contemporary Augustinian theory. Focusing on the question of the victim, I contend that Agamben's and Metz\u2019s approach to \u201cuniversality\u201d can serve to illuminate and to challenge some of the more \u201cparticularistic\u201d and exclusionary elements of the Augustinian form.",

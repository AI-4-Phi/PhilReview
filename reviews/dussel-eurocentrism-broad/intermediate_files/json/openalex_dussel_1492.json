      "abstract": "This essay addresses some recent theoretical developments that are laying an important role in the decolonization of knowledge.That knowledge has been colonized raises the question of whether it was ever free.The formulation of knowledge in the singular already situates the question in a framework that is alien to precolonial times, for the disparate modes of producing knowledge and notions of knowledge were so many that knowledges would be a more appropriate designation.Unification was a function of various stages of imperial realignment, where local reflections shifted their attention to centers elsewhere to the point of concentric collapse.On their way, those varieties of knowledge coalesced into knowledge of the center, and successive collapses of centers under the weight of other centers led, over time, to the global situation of the center and its concomitant organization of knowledges into knowledge.This path has not, however, been one exclusively built upon alienation, for along with the strange and the alien were also the familiar and the, at times, welcomed.Enrique Dussel is a member of a community of scholars who have questioned the logic of self reflection offered by the most recent stage of centered productions of knowledge. 1 The philosophical framework of such rationalization is familiar to most students of Western philosophy: Ren\u00e9 Descartes reflected on method in the seventeenth century, grew doubtful, and articulated the certainty of his thinking self in opposition to the fleeting world of physical appearance.A result of such intellectual labor is a shift of first questions from meditations on what there is to what can be known.This focus on epistemology as first philosophy charted the course of philosophy in modern terms against and with which contemporary philosophers continue to struggle and grapple.For political thinkers, the new beginning is a little earlier, in the late fifteenth-through early sixteenthcentury reflections on politics by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.Against these intellectualist formulations of modern life, Dussel raises the question of its underside, of the geopolitical, material impositions and the unnamed millions whose centers collapsed not simply from the force of ideas but sword and musket.That modernity was ironically also identified by Machiavelli but often overlooked through how he is read today: in The Prince, Machiavelli wrote of the effects of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella's victory over the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula. 2His focus on the repression wrought in the name of Christendom presumed, however, the continued significance of the Mediterranean in the commerce of world-constituting activity.Dussel's work argues that the continued conflict spread westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and by October of that year, 1492, a series of new relations were established with a New World that de-centered the Mediterranean, stimulated a new economy and, with it, an organization of its management (new epistemologies), and re-aligned the western peninsula of Asia into a new political territory in the form of a continent, namely, Europe.Prior to the emergence of Europe, there were maps of the Mediterranean that would have to",

      "abstract": "This special issue of Transmodernity, \"Thinking through the Decolonial Turn: Post-Continental Interventions in Theory, Philosophy, and Critique,\" stands on three fundamental premises that serve as the starting point for the dialogical encounters between intellectuals from Latin America, the Caribbean, and from minoritized sectors in the United States, particularly Latina/o and African American, who are featured here.The first one is that just as there has been a linguistic and a pragmatic turn, among other such turns in theory and philosophy, there has also being a decolonial turn with distinct features, some of which will be elucidated in these two issues. 1Different from these other turns, however, the decolonial turn has long existed in different ways, opposing what could be called the colonizing turn in Western thought, by what I mean the paradigm of discovery and newness that also included the gradual propagation of capitalism, racism, the modern/gender system, and the naturalization of the death ethics of war. 2 The second premise or fundamental hypothesis is that the decolonial turn is anchored in specific forms of skepticism and epistemic attitudes out of which certain critical questions and the search for answers are generated.And the third is that this turn, its form of skepticism and attitude, are arguably most at home in spaces such as ethnic studies and gender and women's studies departments, units, and research centers in the Western academy, as well as in different institutions such as indigenous universities and among decolonial activists, independent scholars, and artists across the entire spectrum of the Global South, including the south in the north. 3To be sure, that the decolonial turn is particularly at home in spaces such as ethnic, women, or gender studies does not mean that every scholar in such spaces is effectively thinking through and contributing to the decolonial turn, or that the decolonial turn can only be found in such spaces.Arguably, because of its emancipatory goals and its suspension of method, the decolonial turn cannot be fully contained in single units of study, or captured within the standard division of labor between disciplines or areas in the traditional arts and sciences.What is at stake is the larger task of the very decolonization of knowledge, power, and being, including institutions such as the university. 4e Decolonial Turn I have provided an initial genealogy and a description of the decolonial turn elsewhere, and Walter Mignolo adds important considerations in his contribution to this issue, but a succinct introductory note is in place here. 5 Decolonial thinking has existed since the very inception of modern forms of colonization-that is, since at least the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries-, and, to that extent, a certain decolonial turn has existed as well, but the more massive",

      "abstract": "Liberation philosophy, as a Latin American project for critical thought, is one among many expressions of a shift in global power dynamics and in epistemic perspective that has taken place since the Second World War.*The European crisis, or more than a crisis, its own internal devastation after the war, opened at least three paths for the train of history and thought.On the one hand, the United States -which had proven itself as an international power through the expansion from the thirteen colonies, the war with Mexico, and the Spanish-American War -became after the Second World War a hegemonic force that would both assist and displace Northwestern Europe as the power-axis of the modern world-system.With this, Americanism -the triumphalist and assimilationist ideology of the United States which had already burst onto the scene with Theodore Roosevelt in the late nineteenth century -was decisively introduced to the rest of the world.This Americanist discourse would dictate the terms for the assimilation of non-Catholic European immigrants, some of which were seen as belonging to darker races. 1 This ideology has taken various turns with McCarthyism and Reagan in the context of the Cold War, and today it takes on a new spirit in formulations like that offered by Samuel P. Huntington, who has forcefully rearticulated Americanism with respect to immigrants and ethnic minorities in the United States. 2 But today, after the Cold War and the attacks of 11 September, it is no longer European immigrants that allegedly pose a \"challenge\" to U.S.-American identity, but rather Latin American (im)migrants, particularly Spanish-speaking Mexicans and Chicana/os. 3 There is, accordingly, a particular importance today for exploring the decolonial potential of those cultural forms originating in Latin America, Mexico, and in the borderlands between Mexico and the United States, among other \"frontier\" territories both to the north and south of this border. 4e second path that opened with the decline of Europe was, clearly, that of the Cold War rival of Americanism: Soviet communism.Soviet communism, or at least socialism (which is a different but related political system/ideology), would become for many a viable option for a different future, beyond both fascist and liberal Europe.Europe itself would come to be divided between these two newly regnant ideologies and neo-imperial geo-political projects.Other regions also suffered the force of this clash of political projects, while many nations tried to find a space between or in alliance with the two dominant blocs.Now, the decline of Europe opened a third path, which we will call -following Frantz Fanon -that of the \"wretched of the earth,\" as well as the \"de-colonial turn.\" 5 This door would be definitively forced open through the combination of the internal and external devastation of Europe, that is to say, not only by the perverse force of Nazism in its interior but also by the encouraging force of the decolonization of European territories abroad.In contrast to the Latin American liberation struggles of the nineteenth century, which took place in a context in which the weakening of Southern Europe left intact the fascination with the increasing strength of Northern Europe (especially France and England), mid-twentieth century Europe was destroyed by Nazism and completely demoralized.As the",

      "abstract": "Abstract The lack of ontological pluralism in International Relations has been a strong determinant of the general scope of the discipline and its objects of study, as well as all that is rendered irrelevant to the study of the \"international\". IR has marginalized difference not only by disciplining epistemologies, but also by rejecting other ontologies, particularly those which belong to indigenous peoples, by relegating them to the realm of myths, legends and beliefs. The roots of ontological marginalization are deeply seeded, so much so that they are present in virtually every field of science (social or not). In order to understand this concern with ontology, we need to refer to the modern age, specifically its Western and now liberal manifestations. The main objective of this article is to put the ontological question on the table. It is argued that the \"truth\" of one-world, one reality and one universe is also a myth, showing how it has hidden many worlds and many realities. The concept of the pluriverse is used to show how - from different ontological positions, particularly relational cosmovisions like the Andean worldview -, alternatives actually appear. The text is divided into three parts: the first one depicts the pluriverse and what it implies and enables, the second describes how the pluriverse has been occulted by the myth of modernity, and the third part is an attempt to illustrate how relational ontologies contribute to the theoretical constitution of the global.",

With co-funding from the Danish Social Science Research Council she is currently involved in the research project 'ALICE\u2014Strange Mirrors, Unsuspected Lessons' (alice.ces.uc.pt), coordinated by Professor Boaventura de Sousa Santos. Julia's research has emphasized questions of race and racism in relation to human rights, citizenship, development, anti-racist social movements, 'other' knowledges, existentialism, theories from the south, and decolonial social change. Her most recent publications are: 'Democratising Democracy, Humanising Human Rights. European Decolonial Movements and the \"Alternative Thinking of Alternatives\"' (Migration Letters, 2013); and 'Race, Social Struggles, and \"Human\" Rights: Contributions from the Global South' (Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies, 2013).Notes1 This article was developed in the context of the participation of the Decoloniality Europe network in the research project 'ALICE\u2014Strange Mirrors, Unsuspected Lessons', coordinated by Boaventura de Sousa Santos (alice.ces.uc.pt) at the Centre for Social Studies of the University of Coimbra, Portugal. The project is funded by the European Research Council, 7th Framework Program of the European Union (FP/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement n. [269807]. The Danish Social Science Research Council also funds the specific sub-project in which the researcher is engaged concerning the contributions to Europe from the south inside the north.2 The article presents my take on the issues raised, and does not necessarily represent that of the movements involved in the network. I coordinated the network between 2010 and 2013, and worked in a collaborative research project with some of its movements regarding 'human rights and other grammars of human dignity' in the above-mentioned ALICE research project. In this period, the Decoloniality Europe network aimed at fomenting communication, discussion and collaboration between scholars and activists working towards decolonization inside the European geographical space (paraphrase of webpage: http://decolonialityeurope.wix.com/decoloniality#!about/component_74511). From the spring of 2014, the network is undergoing several structural adjustments, which imply a more concrete political orientation and goals, which will be made available in the new webpage of the network.3 Marisol De la Cadena, 'Indigenous Cosmopolitics in the Andes: Conceptual Reflections Beyond \"Politics\"', Cultural Anthropology 25(2), 2010, pp 334\u2013370.4 Shelley Wright, International Human Rights, Decolonisation and Globalisation: Becoming Human, London: Routledge, 2001; Walter D Mignolo, Local Histories/Global Designs: Coloniality, Subaltern Knowledges, and Border Thinking, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000; Walter Mignolo, 'Islamophobia/Hispanophobia: The (Re) Configuration of the Racial Imperial/Colonial Matrix', Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge 5(1), 2006, pp 13\u201328; Ram\u00f3n Grosfoguel, 'The Structure of Knowledge in Westernized Universities: Epistemic Racism/Sexism and the Four Genocides/Epistemicides of the Long 16th Century', Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge 11(1), 2013, pp 73\u201390; Ram\u00f3n Grosfoguel, 'Human Rights and Anti-Semitism after Gaza', Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge 7(2), 2009, pp 89\u2013102; Ram\u00f3n Grosfoguel and Eric Mielants, 'The Long-Dur\u00e9e Entanglement Between Islamophobia and Racism in the Modern/Colonial Capitalist/Patriarchal World-System', Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge 5(1), 2006, pp 1\u201312.5 The definition of 'colonial Europe' used by the Decoloniality Europe network (2010\u20132013) is the following: 'Colonial Europe: Refers to contemporary problems that emerged with the Europe that was invented with colonialism since the 16th century, and that was erected as the centre of the world and as the beginning and end of history. This colonial Europe was built upon the negation of the \"other\" inside and outside of Europe. This means that the colonial universalized Europe is not the same as the geographic Europe. Neither does it represent the totality of its population, but it does extend beyond the geographical European space, and is to be found in the minds and actions of people and groups worldwide. In this sense, when speaking about a colonial Europe, we refer to an epistemic, political, existential and (non-)ethical place, which is based upon the negation of the non-European \"other\", and the violence, racism, epistemicide and genocide against him and her. Colonial Europe is constituted as the originary site of the white political field, and is thus dependent upon maintaining the racial hierarchies.'

Grosfoguel's point is that these four more or less simultaneous genocides translate into a predator-subjectivity, the I exterminate, that precedes the I conquer of the first modernity, and hence also the Cartesian I think of the second modernity. In relation to the I conquer see Enrique Dussel, 1492. El encubrimiento del Otro.

Critiques and counter-projects that draw inspiration from Latin American decolonial thinking have become an increasingly prominent part of this, particularly in the past few years. In this article, I offer an assessment of this nascent decolonial IR. I make two broad arguments: that dominant modes of decolonial critique in IR need to be supplemented by projects that unravel-that is, make sense of and disrupt-racialized power and knowledge relations as they play out across multiple political, economic, and epistemic sites; and that achieving this requires more nuanced and targeted decolonial methodologies than those that are currently available. This leads me to reframe coloniality in IR as a methodological problem, not to supplant questions of epistemology, ontology, or ethics in decolonial IR but to render them more amenable to empirical analysis. Illustrating my discussion through reference to the global governance of \"traditional knowledge,\" I sketch out a methodological framework for decolonial IR that is attentive to the slow, context-specific processes through which coloniality (re)emerges but is also reshaped.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Southern criminology has been recognized as a leading theoretical development for attempting to overcome the perpetuation of colonial power relations reflected in the unequal flow of knowledge between the Global North and Global South. Critics, however, have pointed out that Southern criminology runs the risk of recreating epistemicide and colonial power structures by reproducing colonial epistemology and by being unable to disentangle itself from the hegemony of Western modern thought. This article introduces the approach of the \u201cdecolonial option,\u201d which suggests that all our contemporary ways of being, interacting, knowing, perceiving, sensing, and understanding are fundamentally shaped by coloniality\u2014long-standing patterns of power that emerged because of colonialism and that are still at play (Maldonado-Torres 2007; Quijano 1992). The \u201cdecolonial option\u201d seeks ways of knowing and being that heal, resist, and transform these deeply harmful and embedded patterns of power. Drawing on the \u201cdecolonial option,\u201d this article aims to provide a constructive critique of Southern criminology by facilitating a better understanding of \u201ccoloniality\u201d and offering an epistemological shift that is necessary to move toward global and cognitive justice. The rupture and paradigm shift in criminological knowledge production offered by the \u201cdecolonial option\u201d dismantles criminology\u2019s Western universalist narratives and its logic of separation that lie in modernity. By doing so, it provides a different understanding of modernity that looks behind its universalizing narratives and designs (e.g., development, progress, salvation) to expose \u201ccoloniality\u201d\u2014modernity\u2019s dark, destructive side. While the \u201cdecolonial option\u201d does not entail a universalizing mission, it is an option \u2014one of the many paths that one can select to undertake decolonial work\u2014and this article argues that if Southern criminology were to incorporate the decolonial epistemological and conceptual framework, it could better insulate itself from certain consequences of \u201ccoloniality\u201d that it risks embodying.",

Ao entend\u00ea-la como l\u00f3gica do imperialismo, constitutiva e relacional da colonialidade, observo ainda que as estrat\u00e9gias de descoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o devem ser muito mais dirigidas \u00e0 \u201cImperialidade\u201d do que \u00e0 modernidade propriamente dita.

      "abstract": "The concept of Planetary Health has recently emerged in the global North as a concern with the global effects of degraded natural systems on human health. It calls for urgent and transformative actions. However, the problem and the call to solve it are far from new. Planetary health is a colonial approach that disregards alternative knowledge that over millennia have accumulated experiences of sustainable and holistic lifestyles. It reinforces the monolog of modernity without realizing that threats to \u201cplanetary health\u201d reside precisely in its very approach. It insists on imposing its recipes on political, epistemological, and ontological peripheries created and maintained through coloniality. The Latin American decolonial turn has a long tradition in what could be called a \u201ctransformative action,\u201d going beyond political and economic crises to face a more fundamental crisis of civilization. It deconstructs, with other decolonial movements, the fallacy of a dual world in which the global North produces epistemologies, while the rest only benefit from and apply those epistemologies. One Health of Peripheries is a field of praxis in which the health of multispecies collectives and the environment they comprise is experienced, understood, and transformed within symbolic and geographic peripheries, ensuing from marginalizing apparatuses. In the present article, we show how the decolonial promotion of One Health of Peripheries contributes to think and advance decentralized and plural practices to attend to glocal realities. We propose seven actions for such promotion.",

      "abstract": "At the centre of the debates on internationalisation one can notice tensions between the agenda of completing the incomplete project of modernity, which dovetails into the current hegemonic neoliberal capitalist globalisation with its \ufffdglobal turn\ufffd towards the creation of \ufffdglobal\ufffd universities; and the resurgent and insurgent agenda of completing the incomplete project of decolonisation predicated on deracialisation, de-hierarchisation, decorporatisation, and depatriachisation of knowledge and education. This article contributes to the decolonisation of internationalisation of higher education at four main levels. In the first place, it underscores the primacy of knowledge in creating a reality known as \ufffdthe international\ufffd with Europe and North America at the centre. In the second, it makes a strong case for taking seriously the idea of the locus of enunciation of knowledge as a basis of critique of the hegemonic neoliberal globalisation\ufffds notion of a global economy of knowledge that is decontextualised and ignores the resilient uneven division of intellectual and academic labour. In the third, it calls for intercultural translation, mosaic/convivial epistemology, and ecologies of knowledges as key to any successful decolonised internationalisation of higher education. In the fourth, it argues for the reconstruction of university into pluriversity informed by the practices of globalectics and the coexistence of particularities. These four interventions constitute essential enablers in the cultivation of transnational knowledge that is of service to a world characterised by planetary human entanglements.",

      "abstract": "The dominant manners in which environmental issues have been framed by sociology are deeply problematic. Environmental sociology is still firmly rooted in the Cartesian separation of Society and Nature. This separation is one of the epistemic foundations of Western modernity-one which is inextricably linked to its capitalist, colonial, and patriarchal dimensions. This societal model reifies both humanity and nature as entities that exist in an undeniably anthropocentric cosmos in which the former is the only true actor. Anthropos makes himself and the world around him. He conquers, masters, and appropriates the non-human, turning it into the mere environment of his existence, there solely for his use. If sociology remains trapped in this paradigm it continues to be blind to the multiple space-time specific interrelations of life-elements through which heterogeneous and contingent ontologies of humans and extra-humans are enacted. If these processes of interconnection are not given due attention, the socioecological worlds in which we-human as well as others-live cannot be adequately understood. But misunderstandings are not the only issue at stake. When dealing with life-or-death phenomena such as climate change, to remain trapped inside the Society/Nature divide is to be fundamentally unable to contribute to world reenactments that do not oppress-or, potentially, extinguish-life, both human and extra-human. From the inside of Anthropos' relation to his environment the only way of conceiving current socioecological problems is by framing them in terms of an environmental crisis which could, hypothetically, be solved by the very same societal model that created it. But if the transformation of some of the world(s)' life-elements into the environment of the Human is part of the problem, then, socioecological issues cannot be adequately understood or addressed if they are framed as an environmental crisis. Instead, these problems need to be conceived as a crisis of Western modernity itself and of the kind of worlds that are possible and impossible to build within it.",

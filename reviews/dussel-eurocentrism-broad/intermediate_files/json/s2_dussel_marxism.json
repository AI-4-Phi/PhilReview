      "abstract": "The opportunities and limitations of Open Marxism (OM) for understanding structure and agency in capitalist society and political economy have been subject to various debates. Critics assert that, in spite of an auspicious commitment to keeping struggle in view, OM as a theoretical approach nonetheless tends to dialectically intertwine structure and agency in such a way that the latter disappears into the former. Critics argue that this presents an unassailable challenge for empirical work and practical politics. Only its further development will keep OM from closing up. This can be done by using Radical Historicism, a methodological intervention that treads a different path through the dialectical unity of agency and structure, avoiding closure. As a potential modification of OM geared toward making it methodologically operational, Radical Historicism provides a philosophical foundation for both empirical research agendas and political praxis.",

Building primarily on the international thought and work of Norman Angell on imperialism, this article reveals that there was an important intellectual contest preceding the denominated \u201cfirst great debate.\u201d It also shows that even though Angell was not a Marxist, his figure discloses Marxism as an important theoretical force in the genesis of the discipline.",

It suggests that Marxist theory enables us to re-evaluate the priorities of human rights as a political project, and that in doing so it complements the social constructionist approach prevalent within the sociology of human rights. Taken together, a Marxist theory of social structure and a social constructionist theory of human rights enable a fuller realisation of the possibility of an emancipatory politics.",

      "abstract": "W. E. B. Du Bois is finally recognized as one of the founders of sociology, a social theorist, and a methodological innovator. The recognition of Du Bois' work is accompanied by the emergence of a contemporary Du Boisian sociology. This sociology takes inspiration from the work of Du Bois, but it does not limit itself to his work. It aims to bring into sociology the work of scholars that so far have been confined to the margins of the discipline, among them, Franz Fanon and Stuart Hall. Yet, as Du Bois work gets increasing visibility, important debates emerge. One of these debates concerns Du Bois' relation to Marxism, and the relationship between Du Boisian sociology to Marxist sociology. Marxist sociologists argue that Du Bois' late work, as well as the work of Franz Fanon and Stuart Hall, belongs in the Marxist tradition. In this essay I argue that while Du Bois, Fanon, and Hall were sympathetic to Marxism, their work cannot be encapsulated within the Marxist tradition. The question of the human was central to their thought. Moreover, for them colonialism and racism structure identity, lived experience and politics under capitalism in ways that are not reducible to class and class conflict. The Marxist appropriation of their work diminishes its originality and precludes the discipline from questioning the coloniality of its historical silences and its epistemic limits.",

The debate refers ultimately to ontology, more precisely to the relation between society and nature. Critical realism plays a central role as the philosophical underlabouring for metabolic rift theory and has implications regarding the Anthropocene/Capitalocene debate as well. Reviewing the debate through CR categories provides clarity about the specifically social character of the causes of ecological disruptions. Using CR, metabolic rift theorists could explain the interdisciplinary character of their analyses. By distinguishing between real transfactual mechanisms and their actual interaction in open systems, I intend to show that neither metabolic rift theory, nor its interdisciplinary approach to the Anthropocene, involve Cartesian Dualism, as Moore claims. World-Ecology provides an alternative historical account of capitalism's environmental history, but it does not critically replace metabolic rift theory.",

Robinson underestimates the extent to which the Black radical tradition emerged due to an internal critique of certain intellectual currents in Western social formations. The second half of the essay argues that Robinson\u2019s approach amounts to a restatement of the methodological orientation that, in the context of debates about African philosophy in the 1960s, came to be associated with \u201cethnophilosophy.\u201d Like those who engage in ethnophilosophy, Robinson uses the concept of Western civilization to homogenize and essentialize a complex intellectual history. This homogenization and essentialization distort our understanding of both Western intellectual history and the Black radical tradition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Within academic discourses of postcolonial theory, much has been written on whether and how Marxism can be drawn on to understand the \u2018postcolonial world\u2019 and, in this regard, what the relations between Eurocentrism and Marxism are. In practice, Marxism remains a core analytical framework for many emancipatory movements from the Global South, as is the case for Egyptian organisation of Revolutionary Socialists, whose popularity grew during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The following paper is based on anthropological research with Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists in exile and the political underground. It showcases that many academic postcolonial debates sideline the agency of Marxist social actors from the Global South, their theoretical and practical endeavours, and their own modes of knowledge production. It is through the agency of Revolutionary Socialist social actors that Marxism travels from below, is translated, (re)read, debated, and materialises itself in given contexts. I highlight how Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists utilise Marxism as a living theory in their contemporary political practice and argue that their practice in exile as fellow travellers can be understood as a reconfiguration of the concept of travelling theory into travelling theory from below. Herein the centrality of social actors\u2019 practice in grasping theory manifests itself.",

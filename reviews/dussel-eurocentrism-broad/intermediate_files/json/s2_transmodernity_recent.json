      "abstract": "This essay offers a critical reading of the work of Enrique Dussel on the colonial history of modernity and the possibility of a plural trans-modern future. Dussel\u2019s transmodernity points to a plural vision of global modernity, opening multiple possible modes of being and thinking. I critically analyze Dussel\u2019s concept of the periphery and the \u201cother\u201d of colonial history, arguing for the importance of a materialist and non-absolute vision of the other. I consider the possibilities of dialogue in a transmodern framework in the wake of the battlefield of colonization. Emphasizing South-South and North-South dialogues, I argue for a plural vision that engages both rational-epistemic practices and creative passions that are not strictly epistemic. En este texto, analizo cr\u00edticamente la obra de Enrique Dussel sobre la historia colonial de la modernidad y defiendo la posibilidad de un futuro transmoderno plural. La transmodernidad de Dussel apunta a una visi\u00f3n plural de la modernidad global, abriendo m\u00faltiples modos posibles de ser y de pensar. Analizo cr\u00edticamente el concepto de Dussel de la periferia y del \u201cotro\u201d de la historia colonial, argumento por la importancia de una visi\u00f3n materialista y no absoluta del otro. A partir de esto, considero las posibilidades del di\u00e1logo en un marco transmoderno sobre el trasfondo de la colonizaci\u00f3n. Al enfatizar los di\u00e1logos Sur-Sur y Norte-Sur, defiendo una visi\u00f3n plural que comprometa tanto las pr\u00e1cticas racional-epist\u00e9micas como las pasiones creativas que no son estrictamente epist\u00e9micas.",

It challenges the Eurocentric periodization of history, emphasizing the erasure and misrepresentation of non-European civilizations in the global narrative. By examining the ideological constructs underpinning modernity, capitalism, and colonialism, the essay advocates for a pluriversal approach to knowledge and cultural traditions. It also critiques the inadequacies of postmodernism in addressing systemic inequities, proposing transmodernity as a framework for integrating diverse traditions and fostering dialogue among cultures of the Global South.

At once a work of science fiction, a medical mystery, and a history of malaria research, this hybrid novel sets into rivalry India\u2019s old-time wisdom and spirituality against Western science and English colonial presumptuousness, thus advocating transmodernity and the pluriversality put forward by critics such as Rosa Mar\u00eda Rodriguez Magda, Enrique Dussel and Walter Mignolo, among others. This paper will analyse the way in which this novel denies the existence of a universal scientific method by deconstructing the certainties of an exclusively rationalist discourse whose discoveries have often gone hand in hand with exploitation, unequal power relations and colonization. Jacques Derrida\u2019s notion of diff\u00e9rance and Emmanuel Levinas\u2019s ideas about the ethics of silence and knowledge will also be used to analyse silence as an alternative epistemological framework through which the dominant discourse can be undermined and the subaltern heard, and as a means to make amends for the injustices of the past by reclaiming the histories written by those who were made \u2018others\u2019 by the English imperial power.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

      "abstract": "\nIn this essay I engage with the writings of the Argentine-Mexican Marxist philosopher Enrique Dussel for a multifaceted understanding of transmodernity and its value as a theoretical paradigm for reading and interpreting literary and cultural texts. Transmodernity, for Dussel, is a global phenomenon that subsumes and transcends European Modernity of the last five centuries and rejects the latter\u2019s epistemological hegemony in favor of a vaster, more ancient imaginary that includes the nondominant, the exteriorized, and the neglected majority of the world. In contextualizing Eurocentric modernity and repudiating its hegemony and pernicious developmentalism, transmodernity zooms out of EuroAmerica to refocus attention on frameworks of contact and multiplicity that do not rely upon the hierarchization of modernities as dominant, on the one hand, and derivative, on the other. By disengaging from the center-periphery model, transmodernity foregrounds laterality, relationality, and adaptation as potential theorizations for how cultures and languages in contact emerge and function. The essay explores dimensions of transmodernity by examining four crucial terms in Dussel\u2019s thought: people, exteriority, transversal, and analectical. Dussel\u2019s lifelong commitment to the indigenous and the marginalized cultures of Latin America provides us, I argue, a model for imagining regional, South-South interculturalities that can be, on their own terms, fully modern.",

It asks whether we must distinguish between a social-historical condition, that of transmodernity, and an aesthetic mode, that of transmodernism, as we do between modernity and modernism, or postmodernity and postmodernism. These theoretical observations are then brought to bear on my reading of a Bengali novel, Akhtaruzzaman Elias\u2019s\n Khw\u0101bn\u0101m\u0101\n (Dream chronicle), first published in 1996. This text focuses both on the subjectivity and the subjection of the peasant in a time of upheaval, as they are called upon to negotiate pasts that survive as memory, dream or trauma, and to cope with a present of alienation and suffering. Elias deconstructs the politics of nationhood, offering in its stead an insurrectionary poetics that subjects history, time and nature to the dialectical (or, as Dussel might put it, analectical) promise of allegory.\n",

This paper interrogates the said interpretation based on the center\u2010periphery dynamic created by the politics of modernity, and proposes to use instead the decolonial pluriversal perspective and the concept of transmodernity to understand the experiences of being of the colonized African populations of Grand\u2010Bassam and Asmara outside of Western onto\u2010epistemologies. It points to the N'zima village and Abbashawel as the areas that enable visualizing reality that contests the binaries created by Western modernity in seeking pluralistic politics.",

Given that Dussel sees the role of politics as perpetuating life on earth, the transmodern world must also be based on politico-economic institutions that use natural resources sustainably. The institution of the commons, or communal management of natural resources, both predates capitalist modernity and is found in most of the cultures that constitute the periphery of the current capitalist world system. In this context, this article examines the tensions between capitalist modernity and commons-based social arrangements in Anita Agnihotri\u2019s 2015 Bengali novel Mahanadi, arguing that Mahanadi envisions the commons as a creation through mutualistic relations between humans and nonhumans, and also that the vision of the commons that Agnihotri\u2019s novel puts forward could be read as a transmodern institution.",

El texto comienza mostrando c\u00f3mo Dussel se encontr\u00f3 con la riqueza y los l\u00edmites del pensamiento levinasiano sobre el reconocimiento. Siguiendo los pasos de Levinas, Dussel argumenta sobre la fecundidad \u00e9tica y pol\u00edtica de un reconocimiento asim\u00e9trico y no rec\u00edproco de la alteridad radical. Este reconocimiento espec\u00edfico es el verdadero motor del m\u00e9todo anal\u00e9ctico propio de la Filosof\u00eda dusseliana de la liberaci\u00f3n. Recordando los principales puntos de su debate con Axel Honneth, el art\u00edculo muestra, entonces, que la \u00c9tica de la Liberaci\u00f3n (1998) y la Pol\u00edtica de la Liberaci\u00f3n (2007) dan prioridad a un reconocimiento a la vez material, formal y \u201cfactible\u201d de los Otros excluidos y oprimidos. Este reconocimiento cr\u00edtico se concretiza en la lucha pol\u00edtica por la dignidad de los diversos movimientos sociales o frentes de liberaci\u00f3n tanto en el Sur como en el Norte, y en el di\u00e1logo intercultural hacia una transmodernidad pluriversal.",

It is about issues and challenges regarding the decolonial paradigm, which focuses on the \u201cgeopolitics of power, knowledge and being\u201d that resulted from the European colonization process over parts of the globe. Rougier and Colin emphasize the epistemic centrality of coloniality and its intimate relationship with modernity, which was built according to a Eurocentric narrative; therefore, knowledge elaboration should no longer be based on a Eurocentric point of view, but on a pluriversal one, giving due importance to local histories and thus making it possible to reassess the locus of enunciation established by modernity. The translation of this article into Brazilian Portuguese aims to make it accessible to those who show an interest in the subject, thereby enabling the diversity of points of view and the consequent enrichment of the debate about the decolonial turn.",

In this sense, the article develops the discussion on rationality and irrationality of modernity (myth of modernity) and its transmodernity (overcoming), as it is directly related to the question of the negative dialectical method with the negation of otherness - of indigenous populations - in philosophical systems. Eurocentric totality and points out the analytical movement as overcoming, expanding and liberating the negative dialectical method. It also outlines the intercultural philosophy of Raul Fornet-Betancourt, which aims at a symmetrical dialogue between philosophical knowledge. It is inferred, from the Liberation of the Other as Alterity and Interculturality, the concrete existence of a dialogical relationship between philosophical knowledge, enabling greater cosmological, philosophical and educational enrichment, as well as the teaching of intercultural philosophy in indigenous schools. In this study, the bibliographic review is the methodological strategy used.",

To this end, the first part shows the theoretical constraints caused by the epistemic coloniality that imposes the model upon the modern organization and productivity, competitiveness, and control as their sole axis of analysis. The second part shows the analytical categories used to understand the organizational practices of social collectives in Mexico. These categories came out of community considerations and practices, which stand for political-epistemic projects not included in the theoretical schemes of organizational modernity. Specifically, the notion of communality\u2014 conceived by intellectuals and activists from Oaxaca, M\u00e9xico\u2014 and Dussel\u2019s Trans modernity concept, were created to define the context from which they developed.",

This essay highlights its transdisciplinary character and its focus on social, cultural, and epistemic liberation, which aims to construct a critical and propositional reflection on cultural authenticity and the liberation of Latin America. It refers to Enrique Dussel\u2019s project of transmodernity and his philosophical legacy as a key module for the construction of a paradigm of social, cultural, and epistemic liberation. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of propositional thought on cultural authenticity and liberation, highlighting authors such as Francisco Bilbao, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, and An\u00edbal Quijano. The critique of Eurocentrism and the construction of an alternative paradigm based on horizontal intercultural dialogue are also stressed. The essay is structured around three theoretical nuclei that represent important stages of decolonizing thought: the critique of Eurocentrism and the construction of one\u2019s own identity, epistemic decolonization as a tool of liberation, and, finally, intercultural dialogue as an alternative to domination.",

A partir de experiencias personales, siendo un musicoterapeuta mexicano radicado en Alemania (trabajando con personas desplazadas, colaborando en proyectos comunitarios en M\u00e9xico y Filipinas, y participando en redes internacionales de investigaci\u00f3n), se analizan las formas en que las perspectivas decoloniales en la musicoterapia atraviesan la pr\u00e1ctica musicoterap\u00e9utica del autor. Se recuperan aportes clave de autores que han escrito acerca del decolonialismo, como Enrique Dussel, Ram\u00f3n Grosfoguel, An\u00edbal Quijano y Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui; as\u00ed como de colegas que han abordado cr\u00edticamente la colonialidad en el campo de la musicoterapia, como es el caso del CAMTI Collective.

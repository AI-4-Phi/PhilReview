Quijano\u2019s coloniality of power and Dussel\u2019s transmodernity \u00a0are introduced because they open possibilities for a politicized discussion that goes beyond culturalism and indicate the need of transcending the globalized power of capitalist power as an indispensable condition for the liberation of the victims of this system of power. Follows a critical appraisal of postcolonial studies and a brief overview of its presence in the field of MOS. Finally, the argument for the need of an anti-management perspective is presented.",

      "abstract": "Frankfurt School methodology involves a lasting commitment to immanent critique. What distinguishes immanent critique from other forms of social criticism, scholars in this tradition argue, is that social practices are to be judged according to norms and potentials already contained within their objects. This article considers critical theory's relationship to coloniality by developing a three\u2010part challenge to the practice of immanent critique, drawing on insights of decolonial philosophers Anibal Quijano, Enrique Dussel, Maria Lugones, and Oy\u00e8r\u00f3nk\u1eb9\u0301 Oy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed. Immanent critics, I conclude, risk being inattentive to constitutive exclusions, reinscribing asymmetrical burdens on certain critics, and unwittingly replaying a mechanism of domination familiar from colonialism in and through their preferred method of critique. Accordingly, I argue that immanent critics should attend to relations of power that govern the practice of critique itself and offer reasons for being more pluralistic about our methods of criticism.",

Although decolonial theorists refer to Chicana feminist scholarship in their work, the work of Latin American feminists is ignored. However, the author argues that Chicana feminist theory cannot stand in for Latin American feminist theory because \u201clo latinoamericano\u201d gets lost in translation. Latin American feminists must do their own theoretical work. Central to the critique of the use of gender in decolonial theory is an analysis of the social pacts among white capitalists and white working-class men that not only exclude white women but make citizenship and democracy impossible for men and women of color in the metropolis as well as in the colony. By revealing the nexus between gender, race, and democracy, not only is the coloniality of gender apparent, but also the coloniality of democracy.",

I argue that the epistemological claims of four decolonial thinkers (An\u00edbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, Enrique Dussel, Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez) that make up the coloniality of knowledge thesis are problematic for several reasons: they are based on distorted and simplistic readings of Descartes, Hume and other Enlightenment figures; they make contentious generalizations about so-called Western epistemology; and they ultimately lead to epistemic relativism, which is a problematic basis for the social sciences and, contrary to decolonial aspirations, renders the subaltern unable to speak.",

I then offer a preliminary sketch of what I call \u201caffective alternatives,\u201d which could convey ways of life different from the hegemonic social forms that globalization promotes and imposes. At the very least, affective alternatives present a parallax: seen and felt from the perspective of the alternative, globalization is not taken as neutral, normal, irreversible, or desired; rather, it is \u201cdistorted\u201d into globalization/coloniality, a project to be resisted.

It asks whether we must distinguish between a social-historical condition, that of transmodernity, and an aesthetic mode, that of transmodernism, as we do between modernity and modernism, or postmodernity and postmodernism. These theoretical observations are then brought to bear on my reading of a Bengali novel, Akhtaruzzaman Elias\u2019s\n Khw\u0101bn\u0101m\u0101\n (Dream chronicle), first published in 1996. This text focuses both on the subjectivity and the subjection of the peasant in a time of upheaval, as they are called upon to negotiate pasts that survive as memory, dream or trauma, and to cope with a present of alienation and suffering. Elias deconstructs the politics of nationhood, offering in its stead an insurrectionary poetics that subjects history, time and nature to the dialectical (or, as Dussel might put it, analectical) promise of allegory.\n",

It is about issues and challenges regarding the decolonial paradigm, which focuses on the \u201cgeopolitics of power, knowledge and being\u201d that resulted from the European colonization process over parts of the globe. Rougier and Colin emphasize the epistemic centrality of coloniality and its intimate relationship with modernity, which was built according to a Eurocentric narrative; therefore, knowledge elaboration should no longer be based on a Eurocentric point of view, but on a pluriversal one, giving due importance to local histories and thus making it possible to reassess the locus of enunciation established by modernity. The translation of this article into Brazilian Portuguese aims to make it accessible to those who show an interest in the subject, thereby enabling the diversity of points of view and the consequent enrichment of the debate about the decolonial turn.",

We argue that an excess of critical thinking could lead to scepticism, whereas an overemphasis on alterity could result in dogmatism. Consequently, since both approaches end up obstructing epistemic decolonization, we argue that it is necessary to strike a balance between critique and alterity; a balance that does not resolve the tension, but seeks to reveal its underlying relation. The first section locates decolonial theory within the framework of critical theory. We highlight how Quijano, Dussel and Mignolo invoke the critical tradition, whilst simultaneously claiming that a radical departure from it is necessary. Turning more explicitly to Dussel in Section 2, we explain Dussel\u2019s analectics as a method to localize discourses, in which globally excluded perspectives are foregrounded. In the third section, we defend Dussel\u2019s universalism and rationalism against criticisms from Castro-G\u00f3mez and Vallega by interpreting him as a relational thinker. Ultimately, the paper concludes that the success of epistemic decolonization hinges on its ability to reconcile classic notions of universality and rationality in a manner that avoids dogmatism and scepticism, namely by a continual grounding of philosophical discourse in material life.",

      "abstract": "In this paper I argue that religious practice is key to global thought. To demonstrate this, I explore the work of two thinkers: psychologist Carl Jung and Marxist liberation philosopher Enrique Dussel. As a means of addressing the implicit ontological biases which close the minds of many to spiritual wisdom, my discussion makes use of the quantum metaphysics developed by Jung in correspondence with his patient, Wolfgang Pauli. For Jung ([1957] 2010, 13), real religion is defined by an ongoing relationship to the transcendent, while the rigid dogmatism common to modern institutionalised religion serves to stifle this relationship. Religious practices help us to cultivate our own relationship to the transcendent, and thus to resolve antitheses which we will otherwise externalise into the social world, projecting the qualities which we do not want to see in ourselves onto the Other (Jung [1957] 2010, 3). This \u201cshadow\u201d projection is a key driver of the ongoing crisis in global thought, exemplified by Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza (Albanese 2024). Furthermore, the coloniality and dehumanisation wrought by shadow projection is both perpetuated and capitalised upon by military-industrial-complexes which are materially incentivised to manufacture consent for endless wars in defence of \u201cliberal-democratic\u201d ideals. Religious practices are key means of challenging dogmas, religious, liberal, conservative or otherwise, and reconciling ourselves with the shadows they cast. Dussel shows us what this means on the collective level, emphasising the need to grapple with history, and with the materiality of the present, if we are to understand our infinite responsibility to the Other through recognition of their difference, and, thus, to think globally.",

Dussel, a partir de uma perspectiva feminista que abrange os problemas de g\u00eanero na constru\u00e7\u00e3o da colonialidade e da decolonialidade. As filosofias de Dussel e Quijano, assim como de outros autores decoloniais, trouxeram excelentes ferramentas te\u00f3ricas para pensar a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de subordinados no mundo. No entanto, submetidos ao escrut\u00ednio feminista, eles ainda revelam tra\u00e7os de um pensamento masculinista, que \u00e9 incapaz de cobrir adequadamente a experi\u00eancia das mulheres.

      "abstract": "Modern Western philosophy has long excluded Latin America from its historical and conceptual narrative, reinforcing a Eurocentric understanding of historical development. This study aims to challenge that exclusion by analyzing how Enrique Dussel\u2019s philosophy - especially as developed in 1492: El encubrimiento del Otro and Meditaciones anticartesianas - reconstructs the origins of modern subjectivity from a Latin American, decolonial perspective. Through textual analysis of Dussel\u2019s works and comparative readings of canonical European thinkers such as Hegel and Descartes, this research investigates the historical and ontological link between the ego cogito and the ego conquiro . Following a philosophical and critical-historical method, the study combines close exegesis with genealogical reconstruction to identify how the myth of modernity emerged through colonial conquest and philosophical erasure. The results reveal that, according to Dussel, the Cartesian subject - the foundation of modern philosophy - is only made possible through the prior conquest and objectification of the colonial Other. This encounter is not peripheral but constitutive: Latin America and the broader colonial world played a crucial role in the birth of modernity, both economically and philosophically, and ontologically. As highlighted in its conclusions, this study represents only an initial step: a deconstructive phase within the broader tradition of the Philosophy of Liberation. The study calls for the reconstruction of a philosophical canon that acknowledges its colonial foundations and includes the voices it has historically silenced. Ultimately, it argues that decolonizing philosophy, a process that broadly extends from Latin America to the entire peripheral world, is not only possible but also necessary for a more just and inclusive global thought.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades, new epistemological discussions have been developed to support Latin American pedagogies that distance themselves from the hegemonic discourses of modernity and their colonial accent. In this context, this essay aims to contribute to the understanding of some of the relationships between Enrique Dussel\u2019s pedagogy and Paulo Freire\u2019s pedagogy of liberation. In the first section that contributes to this objective, the three chapters of Dussel\u2019s book\u00a0La pedag\u00f3gica latinoamericana\u00a0and the first two chapters of Freire\u2019s book\u00a0Pedagogy of the Opressed\u00a0are presented. From Dussel\u2019s book, the concepts father-State, mother-popular culture, and son-child-people are highlighted as symbols that explain the cultural relations of domination. From Freire\u2019s book, the concepts of oppressors, oppressed, banking education, and liberating education are highlighted. In the second section of the development, a distinction is made on the levels of analysis of each philosopher and some coincidences on the banking dimension, totality, exteriority, otherness, and the hope of a liberated world. To conclude the paper, it is considered that there is a correlation between both philosophers that favor the dialectic of the collective human and the cultural human in Latin American pedagogies.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

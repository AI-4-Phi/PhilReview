      "abstract": "This article proposes an analectical analysis of contemporary Maya culture in Yucatan framed within the philosophy of liberation and applying the method developed by Enrique Dussel addressing its political, erotic, pedagogical and fetishistic dimensions. More than an object of study, the present work locates Maya culture as a living historical subject, underlining its cosmovision, community - based practices and ways of resisting modern colonial structures. From an ethical perspective grounded in alterity, this article argues that the cultural practices of living Maya communities constitute a critical and emancipatory source for the ongoing construction of a broader alternative civilizational horizon in Latin America. Furthermore, it reflects on contemporary forms of Maya fetishism and on the need for intercultural politics in the Yucatan Pen\u00ednsula aimed at strengthening cultural and community autonomy.",

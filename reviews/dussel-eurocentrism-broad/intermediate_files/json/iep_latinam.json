        "The term \u201cLatin American philosophy\u201d refers broadly to philosophy in, from, or about Latin America. However, the definitions of both \u201cLatin America\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d are historically fluid and contested, leading to even more disagreement when combined.",
        "Although it is anachronistic to speak of Latin American philosophy before the 1850s when the term \u201cLatin America\u201d first entered usage, most scholars agree that Latin American philosophy extends at least as far back as the sixteenth century when the Spanish founded the first schools and seminaries in the \u201cNew World\u201d. Given this widespread agreement that there was \u201cLatin American philosophy\u201d before anyone was using the term \u201cLatin America,\u201d many scholars have argued for including pre-Columbian and pre-Cabralian thought in the history of Latin American philosophy."

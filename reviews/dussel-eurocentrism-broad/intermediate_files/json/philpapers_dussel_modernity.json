        "Under the guiding thread of a de-struction of world political history, and from the position of suffering living corporality, Enrique Dussel presents the context of modern politics in the fifth section of Pol\u00edtica de la liberaci\u00f3n: Historia mundial y cr\u00edtica.",
        "Modernity is not in this case a merely intra-European phenomenon that belongs to a periodization of history enunciated from the West. It is, on the contrary, a moment that arose from the experience of colonization of the non-European Other. As Dussel argues, 1492 will be the moment of the \u2018birth\u2019 of Modernity as a concept, the concrete moment of the \u2018origin\u2019 of a very particular \u2018myth\u2019 of sacrificial violence and, at the same time, a process of \u2018covering up\u2019 of the non-European.",

        "Understanding the context of the emergence of this colonizing experience, that is to say, of the other worlds of life before and outside of this European Modernity, is the objective of this fifth section."

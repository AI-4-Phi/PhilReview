      "abstract": "Abstract This article reconsiders the sixteenth-century Idealist Neo-Confucian philosophy of Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529) in light of the development of twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. After defining liberation theology, this study identifies the crucial contributions made to it by Emmanuel Levinas\u2019s assertion of the primacy of ethics over ontology and critique of the egocentric nature of Western philosophy. It then delineates the epistemological and deontological criticisms made of Roman Catholic orthodoxy\u2014and institutionalized Christianity in general\u2014by Latin American liberation theologians, particularly Enrique Dussel and Jos\u00e9 Porfirio Miranda. These are compared with Wang\u2019s critique of the Rationalist Neo-Confucianism that had been official orthodoxy and the legitimating philosophy for imperial China for three centuries. The study finds that Wang\u2019s Idealist philosophy incorporates epistemological, spiritual, and ethical perspectives with powerful democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure the development of late-twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. Thus, contrary to the conventional view of Confucianism as a conservative philosophy, these elements in Wang\u2019s Neo-Confucianism render it a theology (or philosophy) of liberation.",

Enrique Dussel takes up the concept of Other of Emmanuel Levinas to be able to talk about a subject-victim. However, for Enrique Dussel it is Foucault who makes it possible to highlight a plurality of structures of domination and numerous victims ignored by the system that must be addressed in the Ethics of Liberation. Enrique Dussel claims that Foucault makes a specific analysis of subsystems and exclusion institutions. Could we find in Foucault\u2019s work fundamental notions for the construction of the subject-victim concept? Would it be appropriate to relate Foucauldian and Levinasian thinking to the proposal of the Latin American philosopher? Analyzing the Philosophy of the Liberation of Enrique Dussel we find that these two French philosophies become fruitful and venture to meeting points to become pillars of the construction of a project whose center is the victim.",

First, Graff Zivin evaluates theologian Enrique Dussel\u2019s assimilation of the work of Emmanuel Levinas into his own philosophy of Latin American liberation. Next, Graff Zivin juxtaposes Dussel\u2019s Levinasianism with Doris Sommer\u2019s ostensibly very different Levinasian approach to literary studies, focusing upon her analysis of Mario Vargas Llosa\u2019s 1987 novel El hablador. The chapter then unpacks the debate over the relation between ethics and political militancy that surfaces in Argentina following the publication of philosopher Oscar Del Barco\u2019s 2007 letter \u201cNo Matar\u00e1s\u201d [Thou Shalt Not Kill].",

      "abstract": "Enrique Dussel is considered one of the founding philosophers of liberation in the Latin American tradition, an influential arm of what is now called decoloniality. While he is astoundingly prolific, relatively few of his works can be found in English translation \u2014 and none of these focus specifically on education. Founding members of the Latin American Philosophy of Education Society David I. Backer and Cecilia Diego bring to us Dussel\u2019s The Pedagogics of Liberation: A Latin American Philosophy of Education, the first English translation of Dussel\u2019s thinking on education, and also the first translation of any part of his landmark multi-volume work Towards an Ethics of Latin American Liberation.\n Dussel\u2019s ouevre is an impressive intellectual mosaic that uses Europeans to disrupt European thinking. This mosaic has at its center French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, but also includes Ancient Greek philosophy, Thomist theology, modern Enlightenment philosophy, analytic philosophy of language, Marxism, psychoanalysis (Freud, Klein, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience), phenomenology (Sartre, Heidegger, Husserl, Hegel), critical theory (Frankfurt School, Habermas), and linguistics. Dussel joins these traditions to Latin American history, literature, and philosophy, specifically the work of Octavio Paz, Ivan Illich, and the philosophers of liberation whom Dussel studied with in Argentina before his exile to Mexico in the late 1970s.\n Drawing heavily from the ethics of Levinas, Dussel examines the dominating and liberating features of intimate, concrete, and observable interactions between different kinds of people who might sit down and have face-to-face encounters, specifically where there may be an inequality of knowledge and a responsibility to guide, teach, learn, care, or study: teacher\u2013student, politician\u2013citizen, doctor\u2013patient, philosopher\u2013nonphilosopher, and so on. Those occupying the superior position of these face-to-face encounters (teachers, politicians, doctors, philosophers) have a clear choice for Dussel when it comes to their pedagogics. They are either open to hearing the voice of the Other, disrupting their sense of what is and should be by a newness beyond what they know; or, following the dominant pedagogics, they can try to communicate and instruct their sense of what is and should be (which Dussel, in a Latin American context, associates with dominant cultures) to the (supposed) tabula rasas in their charge. Dussel calls that sense of what is and should be \u201clo Mismo.\u201d [The French in Levinas is \u201cle M\u00eame,\u201d and Backer and Diego have translated Dussel\u2019s \u201clo Mismo\u201d as \u201cthe Same.\u201d]\n This groundbreaking translation makes possible a face-to-face encounter between an Anglo Philosophy of Education and Latin American Pedagogics. \u201cPedagogics\u201d should be considered as a type of philosophical inquiry alongside ethics, economics, and politics. Dussel\u2019s pedagogics is a decolonizing pedagogics, one rooted in the philosophy of liberation he has spent his epic career articulating. With an Introduction by renowned philosopher Linda Martin Alcoff, this book adds an essential voice to our conversations about teaching, learning, and studying, as well as critical theory in general.",

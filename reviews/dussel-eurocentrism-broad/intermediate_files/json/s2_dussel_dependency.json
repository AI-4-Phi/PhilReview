      "abstract": "The article deals with the evolution of Andre Gunder Frank\u2019s views through the prism of his biography. His life had an elective affinity with his academic and ideological interests in his capacities of a scholar and an activist. The article identifies the challenges once faces when attempting to reconstruct and evaluate his research program. Evaluation of Frank\u2019s ideas has been oscillating between mutually exclusive extremes \u2013 cult like following versus bashing of his ideas. Rejection of his ideas has been mostly based on accusing Frank in being an ideologue. It is noted that Frank was one of the pioneers of dependency theory. Frank viewed dependency theory as a third-world response to Eurocentric modernization theory. While modernization theoreticians interpreted developing world problems as the outcome of its internal dynamics, Frank suggested to view the developing nations failings as the result of its structural disadvantageous position within world capitalist system. Frank radicalized dependency theory assumptions having produced the thesis on the development of underdevelopment. His version of the dependency theory became an important source for Immanuel Wallerstein\u2019s world-systems theory. Frank\u2019s last book titled \u201cRe-Orient: Global Economy in the Asian Age\u201d was published in 1998. In that book Frank re-invented himself. Frank transfor med himself from being predecessor of Wallerstein\u2019s world-systems analysis into Wallerstein\u2019s successor with his Asia-centric theory of a single five thousand years world system. Frank\u2019s Asia-centric research program goes beyond more general theorizing and has a high degree of political and policy relevance to post-Leninist nations.",

In this sense, financialization marks a new stage of dependency, intensifying the structural transfer of value and aggravating the superexploitation of labor. These contributions point to an understanding of peripheral financialization that not only acknowledges the particularities of capitalist development in the periphery but also maintains a direct link to class exploitation.

Its analysis is framed by Enrique Dussel's methodological insistence on the international transfer of surplus value as the essence of dependency. Beginning with an examination of the heyday of classical dependency theory in Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1960s and 1970s, the article moves on to consider the increasing importance accorded culture as a site of power and struggle, focusing on the work of Sylvia Wynter. The second half of the article turns to the literary registration of dependency. Arguing that literary works can provide a barometric reading of the pressures of underdevelopment in advance of political-economic analyses, I consider Patr\u00edcia Galv\u00e3o's Parque Industrial (1933) and Olive Senior's 'Boxed-In' (2015). Published, respectively, some forty years either side of the heyday of dependency theory, these paradigmatic fictions are examples of both the diagnostic and active role of literature in responding to the depredations of dependency.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Latin America is once again passing through a crisis. The so-called \u2018pink tide\u2019 of progressive governments gave place to a brown wave of peripheral-fascism. Short-range explanations for the \u2018ebbing\u2019 of the pink tide abound in the literature. They focus on the shortcomings of moderate-left administrations, failing to account for the cyclical nature of capitalist crises and for the authoritarian character of the administrations now coming to power. In search of a comprehensive, long-range explanation, this paper goes back to the core question posed by dependency theory half a century ago: is capitalist development even possible in Latin America? The key to answer this question \u2013 a concept of development that captures non-converging transformation \u2013 was not available to seminal dependency writers such as Frank, Marini, Bambirra and Dos Santos. In this paper, I suggest that the concept of uneven and combined development (UCD) allows for a renewed engagement with dependency's core problem. Conversely, the dependency literature can enrich the analysis of UCD with valuable mid-range concepts, such as \u2018super-exploitation\u2019, \u2018dominated-dominant\u2019 classes and \u2018peripheral fascism\u2019. After establishing the theoretical basis for a political economy of UCD, the paper illustrates the potentialities of this comprehensive theoretical perspective by providing and alternative narrative of the end of the pink tide and the rise of the brown wave in Latin America.",

However, extant approaches are yet to incorporate a more specific assessment of the ways in which economic domination becomes reproduced both systemically and internationally. This article sheds light on the specific forms of unfreedom that result from the nature of capitalist economic power in the international division of labour. It does so through the analysis of Marta Harnecker and Gabriela Uribe\u2019s Popular Education Booklets (CEP being their Spanish acronym), published in the context of Chile\u2019s revolutionary experiment with democratic socialism under the Popular Unity government during the period 1970\u20133. Informed by Marxist Dependency Theory, the CEP series posits the problem of capitalist domination at the level of the interstate system, and presupposes its negation in the form of both popular and national liberation. Through a novel methodology for popular self-education, the CEP series also proposes an ethic of praxis that would enable the labouring classes to exert democratic self-government through conscious economic planning.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Complex systems usually consist of multiple types of components. During system operation, the dependencies between components and the working mechanism of maintenance devices significantly impact system reliability. In this paper, we develop a reliability model of (k1,k2)-out-of-n: G mixed standby retrial system with redundant dependency and working vacation. Two different types of components are present in the system with redundant dependencies between them. The repairman do not cease repairing failed components entirely during their vacation but rather repair failed components at a lower rate. Using Markov process theory, the transition rate matrix and steady-state equations of the system state are given, and the steady-state availability of the system is obtained. The reliability function and mean time to first failure (MTTFF) of the system are derived, and the Runge-Kutta algorithm for calculating the reliability function of the system is given. A system cost optimization model under the availability constraint is constructed using the number of standby components as the decision variable. Based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, an optimization algorithm is designed to solve the optimal standby scheme. Through numerical experiments, the influence of system parameters on the reliability indexes and the optimal standby scheme of the system is analyzed.",

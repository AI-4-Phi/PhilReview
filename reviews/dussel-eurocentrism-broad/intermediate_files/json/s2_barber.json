The strategy of the argument takes the following path: First, it begins with some reflections by Paul Ricoeur about universal civilization and its particular cultures; second, it summarizes a non-eurocentric historical perspective that is pertinent to the Modern Globalizing System; third, it describes the asymmetrical location of the \"participants\" which resulted from the violent process of inclusion in the World System; forth, it points out to certain aspects through which one can see ethical and critical demands within the horizon of globalization; fifth, in conclusion the author suggests some relevant topics for future discussions.",

      "abstract": "Latin American decolonialism\u00a0has a prominent place in current criticism of Eurocentrism in the social sciences and humanities. This paper raises the problem of alterity in the decolonial thinking of Enrique Dussel through the hermeneutical exegesis of three main categories: exteriority, living work and victim. The purpose of this research is to determine the continuities and discontinuities of this problem in the theoretical work of the Argentine-Mexican philosopher.\u00a0 As\u00a0our theoretical-methodological framework, we consider the notions of the de-colonial attitude and the Latin American hermeneutic-philosophical approach to liberation. In the conclusions, we show that the concept of alterity appears\u00a0in Dussel's early work\u00a0associated with Levinasian ethical language. Later, a shift towards an economic-material reflection is evidenced in his mature work as a means to historically understand the oppression and exclusion of peripheral countries.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes a critical reinterpretation of the Kantian framework through a hermeneutic methodology (textual analysis of primary sources) and a phenomenological approach (study of local peace experiences), contrasting Enlightenment universalism with decolonial perspectives. The findings reveal three central obstacles: 1) Kant\u2019s Eurocentric conception of the nation-state, which disregards Latin American communal structures; 2) the underestimation of socioeconomic inequalities as drivers of conflict; and 3) the tension between cosmopolitan law and the legal pluralism practiced in the region. In response, the article argues that peace in Latin America demands a hybrid model integrating Kantian universal ethical principles with local practices of social justice and conflict resolution, drawing on theorists such as \u00c1ngel Papacchini and Enrique Dussel. This work contributes to intercultural political philosophy by a) exposing the limits of Kantian liberalism in non-Western contexts; b) proposing a theoretical bridge between universalism and decoloniality; and c) offering pathways to shift from an imposed liberal peace to one rooted in struggles for dignity and regional\nautonomy. The conclusions emphasize that peacebuilding requires flexible normative frameworks capable of engaging with the epistemologies of the Global South.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this essay is to redefine the value of the approaches of Latin American theorists, such as Boaventura, Dussel, Freire, Grosfoguel, Zea and Zuleta, among other authors, who advocate a decolonial education based on criticality, cultural diversity, own knowledge, emancipation, and liberation, among other features. For this reason, the analysis was based on a qualitative hermeneutic-analytical approach. Among the main contributions, it is determined that the construction of a decolonial pedagogy is obtained from a polynomial epistemic-humanist-ethical alliance: the recognition of the other, interculturality, critical-emancipatory pedagogy, and the validity of ancestral knowledge. It is concluded that the decolonial turn and epistemological decolonization not only outlines theoretical perspectives, but also a possible cognitive pragmatism that guides epistemic praxis to a sociopolitical terrain, where human beings recognize their history and place in the world.",

Salient points considered are the ways both theoretical projects unsettle modernity\u2019s dominant ontological and epistemological foundations by seriously engaging the conceptual potential of thinking with alterity (ethical dimension) and from exteriority (geopolitical dimension). I compare their subversive methodological contributions, examining, in particular, Enrique Dussel\u2019s analectical hermeneutic approach and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro\u2019s ethnographic method of controlled equivocation. Lastly, I discuss how both theories and approaches complement each other\u2019s efforts to destabilize Western modernity\u2019s philosophical and anthropological foundations.",

        "It is for this reason that sometimes some critics and historiographers of the philosophy of liberation make reference to a \u201cstrict\u201d and a \u201cbroad\u201d conception of the philosophy of liberation, in order to refer to the immediate context of its earliest articulations, and to its later general dissemination and development.",
        "The philosophy of liberation belongs to the \u201cmaturity\u201d stage within the \u201ccontemporary\u201d period of Latin American philosophy, if we use Jorge J.E. Gracia and Manuel Vargas\u2019s periodization of Latin American philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013).",
        "Without question, however, the philosophy of liberation is the distinct manifestation of Latin American philosophy that has received the most international attention, and that has had the most influence both within Latin America and the United States[1].",
        "While the philosophy of liberation is deeply rooted in the history and debates of Latin American philosophy, to the extent that it may be claimed that it is the most elaborate and substantive response to the task articulating a distinct Latin American philosophy, it is nonetheless also a chapter within the broader history of European philosophy."

        "On a methodological level, one can also only notice the thorough use of lists in this philosophical paradigm, the more striking example is probably to be found in the Canonical text on possibilities (Sth\u0101n\u0101\u1e45gas\u016btra, 3rd\u20132nd centuries BCE [\u1e6ch\u0101\u1e47.]), in which philosophical considerations take the form of ordered lists of items, starting with singletons in chapter one (e.g., one Mah\u0101v\u012bra in this cosmic cycle), continuing with lists of two items in chapter two (e.g., the self versus non-self stuff), and so on up to the tenth chapter, that presents lists of ten items (e.g., there are ten characteristics of the Jaina path, namely patience, liberation, honesty, kindness, humbleness, truth, self-discipline, austerity, detachment and chastity).",

        "In this conception in which human beings are in principle able to experience up to absolute cognition, it becomes possible even for someone who is not yet liberated to have a share in this, by relying on the teaching of liberated beings. Such a possibility is especially valuable, since knowing the phenomena unknowable by ordinary cognition, like the nature of the self, what happens after death, or the primary cause and final end of the world, is essential inasmuch as it conditions one\u2019s spiritual progress towards the realization of a proper human life. In this dynamic, Jaina philosophers consider that a discourse is authoritative if it is uttered by such a liberated teacher, who is called \u201cthe one who has achieved, who is apt, reliable\u201d (\u0101pta)."

        "In such cases, while each individual member of the disadvantaged group might be negatively free in the sense of being unprevented from choosing the path of liberation, the freedom of the individual is conditional on the unfreedom of the majority of the rest of the group, since not all can escape in this way. Each individual member of the class therefore partakes in a form of collective negative unfreedom (Cohen 1988, 2006; for discussion see Mason 1996; Hindricks 2008; Grant 2013; Schmidt 2020). Another increasingly influential group of philosophers has rejected both the negative and the posit",

In an influential article, the American legal philosopher Gerald MacCallum (1967) put forward the following answer: there is in fact only one basic concept of freedom, on which both sides in the debate converge."

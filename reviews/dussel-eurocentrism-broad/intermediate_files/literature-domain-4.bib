====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain covers Dussel's political philosophy as articulated in his major
works Política de la liberación (2007, 2009) and 20 Tesis de política (2006).
The collected scholarship examines three interrelated themes: (1) Dussel's
critique of liberal democracy and the social contract tradition as Eurocentric
formations that obscure the constituent power of the people, (2) his central
distinction between potentia (the constituent power of the community, which
he terms "hyperpotentia" or poder popular) and potestas (institutionalized
power that risks fetishization), and (3) his concept of transmodernity as a
political project that moves beyond both modernity and postmodernity by
affirming the cultural resources of colonized peoples.

The literature reveals several key debates. First, scholars examine how
Dussel's concept of "obediential power" (poder obediencial) challenges both
liberal representative democracy and Schmittian decisionism by grounding
political legitimacy in the ongoing will of the people rather than in
constitutional origins or sovereign exception. Second, there is extensive
engagement with Dussel's appropriation of Marx's critique of commodity
fetishism to theorize the "fetishism of power" whereby institutionalized
political structures become autonomous from popular will. Third, researchers
explore Dussel's dialogue with European political theorists (Schmitt, Agamben,
Ricœur, Apel) to assess whether his politics of liberation successfully
decolonizes political philosophy or remains within a modified European
framework. Finally, recent work examines transmodernity not merely as a
theoretical concept but as a method for analyzing concrete political movements
in Latin America and the Global South.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

These sources are essential for understanding how Dussel's critique of
Eurocentrism operates at the level of political ontology and institutional
analysis, not merely as a geopolitical or historical claim. His distinction
between potentia and potestas provides a conceptual framework for identifying
how European political thought systematically privileges constituted power
over constituent power, thereby delegitimizing non-European forms of political
organization. The literature on transmodernity is particularly relevant for
assessing whether Dussel offers a viable alternative to both Eurocentric
modernity and the postmodern turn.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

While there is substantial Spanish-language scholarship on Dussel's political
concepts, English-language engagement with specific dimensions of his political
philosophy remains limited. Few papers examine his treatment of Latin American
popular movements (Zapatismo, pink tide governments) as instantiations of his
political theory. There is also limited critical engagement from liberal
democratic theorists who might challenge Dussel's characterization of
representation as inherently fetishistic.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

The synthesis should organize papers according to conceptual clusters rather
than chronology: (1) political theology and critique of sovereignty, (2) the
potentia/potestas distinction and fetishism of power, (3) transmodernity as
political project, (4) critical dialogues with European theorists. Spanish-
language sources provide the most detailed exegesis of Dussel's political
concepts, while English-language sources tend to be more comparative and
critical. The synthesis should attend to both sympathetic reconstructions and
critical assessments from Marxist, liberal, and postcolonial perspectives.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Political theology: 3 papers - Dussel's liberationist political theology as alternative to Schmitt/Agamben
- Potentia/potestas: 5 papers - Core political ontology and critique of fetishized power
- Transmodernity: 4 papers - Decolonial political project beyond modernity/postmodernity
- Critical dialogue: 6 papers - Engagement with Ricœur, Dewey, Apel, Castro-Gómez

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Dussel's philosophy of liberation provides a decolonial corrective to Eurocentric political theology (Badiou, Žižek, Agamben) by centering early Christian thought on community and collectivity from the perspective of the Global South. Demonstrates this through a reading of Dussel's study of Marx's theological metaphors and applies the framework to Caribbean poet Pedro Mir's "Countersong to Walt Whitman," showing how Mir constructs a redemptive state of rebellion against imperial exception.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how Dussel's political philosophy engages with the political theology tradition while critiquing its Eurocentric foundations. Shows how Dussel's liberationist thought can be applied to literary and cultural analysis as a "poetics of liberation" that unravels the transformation of political and theological discourses. Directly addresses the research project's concern with Dussel's alternative to European political frameworks.

  POSITION: Sympathetic reconstruction of Dussel's political theology as corrective to European political theology; situates Dussel as precursor to contemporary debates on Christian Marxism from Global South perspective.

  abstract = {In recent decades, thinkers like Alain Badiou, Slavoj Žižek, and Giorgio Agamben have argued for a serious political engagement with early Christian thought and its emphasis on collectivity and community. Notwithstanding their important theoretical contributions, these writers often remain within a limited Eurocentric framework, foreclosing the possibility of a truly decolonial political theology. Crucially, their relatively recent reappraisals tend to ignore important precursors of Christian Marxism from the Global South, namely liberation theology and the philosophy of liberation, as elaborated by the Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel. This essay contextualizes Dussel’s liberational thought in the contexts of political theology and literary representation. It pays particular attention to Dussel’s study of the Theological Metaphors of Marx by synthesizing a model of literary inquiry based on his philosophy and applying it to a reading of counter-hegemonic poetry by the Caribbean poet Pedro Mir, namely his long poem “Countersong to Walt Whitman.” This reading makes explicit the implicit theological dimension of Mir’s poetic text. Finally, the essay conceptualizes this interpretive model as a poetics of liberation: a mode of engagement with mutually determining discourses – politics, poetics, aesthetics – as well as a mode of reading which unravels the transformation of these discourses in lyrical forms. Writing from the periphery of the US empire, Mir therefore constructs a mode of address which arms itself with both political and theological discourses, however implicitly. To the empire’s miraculous state of exception, Mir counterpoises a redemptive state of rebellion.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the exchange between Ricœur and his former student Dussel on decolonization and European responsibility. Analyzes Ricœur's concept of the "crisis of the concrete universal in Western Europe" and its relation to cultural difference, then critically discusses whether Ricœur's explicitly European perspective can sustain a viable world-historical subject in light of Dussel's critique of Eurocentric modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Important for assessing how Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism engages with and challenges European hermeneutic philosophy. The Ricœur-Dussel dialogue illuminates tensions between European universalism and decolonial pluriversality, particularly regarding who can be a legitimate subject of history. Shows how Dussel's challenge prompted European philosophers to confront their own positionality.

  POSITION: Critical assessment of both Ricœur and Dussel; questions whether European self-reflection can adequately respond to decolonial critique while noting limitations in Dussel's alternative conception of intercultural dialogue.

Departing from the exchange between Ricœur and his former student Enrique Dussel, it discusses the Ricœurian critique of modernity. After giving some background on Ricœur’s reflections on decolonization, it will clarify what Ricœur calls the “crisis of the concrete universal in the thinking and in the historical experience of Western Europe,” and what role cultural difference has in this crisis. Considering Ricœur’s explicitly European perspective, this will lead us to a critical discussion on the envisioned possibility of a world-historical subject. Finally, I will discuss the role of European self-reflection in relation to a horizon of intercultural dialogue and narration from a post-/decolonial perspective.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes how Santiago Castro-Gómez appropriates and transforms Dussel's concept of transmodernity (proposed in 1994) to develop a "transmodern republicanism." Argues that transmodernity as decolonial method takes the rational character of modernity while opposing political, cultural, and economic domination. Establishes the modernity/coloniality dialogue between Dussel and Castro-Gómez as framework for understanding emancipatory (not liberating) politics.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding transmodernity as both political project and method, showing how Dussel's concept has been appropriated and transformed by later decolonial thinkers. Highlights the distinction between liberating and emancipatory politics, relevant to the research project's examination of whether Dussel transcends or remains within European political categories.

  POSITION: Sympathetic exposition of both Dussel and Castro-Gómez; treats transmodernity as viable decolonial method while noting tensions between liberation philosophy and later decolonial theory.
  },
  keywords = {transmodernity, decolonial-theory, republicanism, High},
  abstract = {This article seeks to analyze how the sense of transmodernity is subsumed in phi- losopher Santiago Castro-Gómez, to propose an emancipatory policy. Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures —ana- lectic—. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity —its rational character—, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-Gómez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Dussel and Dewey share commitments to philosophical theory aimed at human problems, democratic inquiry, and progressive reform, but maintain productive differences. Dussel corrects Dewey's Eurocentrism by insisting that political philosophy begin from the perspective of the marginalized, while Dewey encourages a modest experimental and fallibilist approach that may be more feasible than Dussel's phenomenologically-grounded critical theory.

  RELEVANCE: Important comparative study showing how Dussel's political philosophy can be placed in dialogue with American pragmatism. Demonstrates both convergences (democratic modes of inquiry, attention to practice) and divergences (starting point for political philosophy, role of social sciences). Relevant for assessing whether Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism extends to North American philosophical traditions or focuses primarily on European philosophy.

  POSITION: Balanced comparative analysis; appreciates both Dussel's decolonial corrective and Dewey's experimental method; proposes mutual enrichment rather than choosing between them.

Simultaneously, Dewey encourages a modest experimental and fallibilist approach to social transformation that promises more feasible social

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Dussel's reading of theological metaphors in Marx's Capital as a decolonial intervention in political theology. Dussel identifies how Marx employs theological language (fetishism, idolatry, sacrifice) to critique capitalism, and Dussel extends this to critique Eurocentric political formations that sacralize power structures while obscuring their oppressive character.

  RELEVANCE: Connects Dussel's political philosophy to his reading of Marx, showing how the critique of fetishism operates across economic and political domains. Important for understanding the theological dimension of Dussel's political critique and how he decolonizes both Marxism and political theology by reading them from the perspective of Latin American liberation struggles.

  POSITION: Sympathetic exposition of Dussel's theological-political critique; positions Dussel as decolonizing both Marx and contemporary political theology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel's own statement of his transmodern project. Challenges Eurocentric periodization of world history and the ideological constructs of modernity, capitalism, and colonialism. Critiques postmodernism's inadequacy in addressing systemic inequities and proposes transmodernity as framework for integrating diverse traditions and fostering dialogue among cultures of the Global South through a pluriversal approach to knowledge.

  RELEVANCE: Primary source presenting Dussel's mature conception of transmodernity. Essential for understanding how transmodernity differs from both modernity and postmodernity, and how it connects to epistemological decolonization of history.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the fundamental distinction in Dussel's politics of liberation between "lo político" (the political, tied to constituent/instituting power) and "la política" (politics, tied to constituted/instituted power). Argues that both powers are dialectically related and that constituent power does not disappear with formation of instituted power. The starting point is the political power of the community grounded in rational consensus, where the rational is the real (corporeal living human being). Shows how power becomes fetishized when invisibilized, and how the community constitutes itself as "people" when confronting fetishization.

  RELEVANCE: Essential Spanish-language exposition of Dussel's core political ontology—the potentia/potestas distinction. Clarifies how Dussel grounds political power in corporeal life and rational consensus rather than in state sovereignty or constituent moment. Critical for understanding Dussel's alternative to both liberal democracy and Schmittian decisionism. Shows connection between ethical materialism and political theory.

El punto de partida para el desarrollo de lo político y la política es el poder político de la comunidad, cuya sustancia es el consenso racional. Lo racional es lo real y, lo real, es la corporalidad viviente del ser humano. El objetivo -entonces- del proceso político en su conjunto (lo político y la política) es mantener y acrecentar la vida humana. Este objetivo constituye la base de la Política de la Liberación de Enrique Dussel. La sustancia del poder político -de manera inevitable- se invisibiliza -principalmente- con el desarrollo de la política, dando lugar al poder fetichizado. Se trata de un poder donde lo racional queda oculto. La comunidad que decide hacer frente a los embates de la fetichización del poder y que decide instalar otro poder instituido se erige como pueblo.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Explores the passage from Marx's critique of commodity fetishism to Dussel's critique of power fetishism in the critical moment of Politics of Liberation. Examines three parts: (1) the historical necessity of the State form and its inevitable possibility of fetishization, (2) the category of "People" and their "Will-of-life" as anti-fetishist foundation of political power, and (3) the logical passage from the economic to the political field—from fetishism of capital to fetishism of power.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how Dussel appropriates and extends Marx's concept of fetishism from the economic to the political domain. Shows the conceptual continuity between Dussel's critique of capitalism and his critique of Eurocentric political institutions. Demonstrates how the People's Will-of-life serves as counter-principle to fetishized power, relevant to understanding Dussel's alternative political ontology.

  POSITION: Systematic exegesis of Dussel's appropriation of Marx; treats fetishism of power as central category in critique of political modernity and basis for liberationist alternative.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Places Namita Goswami's critique of philosophy's institutional failures within the tradition of "thought from outside" (Foucault-Blanchot, Dussel's philosophy of liberation, Malabou's plasticity). Argues that political critiques of philosophical hegemony contain implicit theorizations of "literature." Examines whether literature can decolonize philosophy and how to conceptualize the plastic relation between inside/outside, center/periphery, without subordinating the latter to the former.

  RELEVANCE: Sophisticated engagement with Dussel's philosophy of liberation as exemplar of "thought from outside" that challenges philosophical hegemony from the geopolitical periphery. Relevant for understanding how Dussel's critique operates at the level of philosophical method and institutional practice, not merely content. Shows connections between Dussel, feminist philosophy, and continental thought on philosophy's relationship to its outside.

This essay places Goswami’s critique within a context of “the thought from outside,” which, beginning with Foucault’s reading of Blanchot, continuing through the geopolitics of Dussel’s philosophy of liberation, and prominent in Catherine Malabou’s conceptualization of plasticity, demonstrates how political critiques of philosophical hegemony contain an implicit theorization of “literature.” If “literature” gives voice to the thought from outside, does it in turn “decolonize” philosophy? If so, what itinerary of thought ought to follow the relationship between this literary decolonization of philosophy and its imbrication within the fold of philosophical thought? How to conceptualize the plastic relation between inside and outside, between center and periphery, without subordinating the latter to the hegemony of the former?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Dussel's philosophy and politics of liberation surpass the "civilizatory" political philosophies of Western modernity by investigating their Eurocentric roots that subordinated Latin America without recognizing the epistemological rupture signified by the invasion of America. Dussel's critical thought gives voice to the excluded, revalues multiple heterogeneous knowledges, and imagines reality otherwise. Examines six theses including Las Casas/Suárez/Vitoria heritage, analysis from exteriority, contemporaneity of liberation philosophy, liberating ethics, geopolitical thought, and transmodernity.

  RELEVANCE: Comprehensive Spanish-language overview of Dussel's philosophy and politics of liberation as counter-hegemonic field. Important for understanding Dussel's retrieval of early modern Iberian political theology (Las Casas, Vitoria) as resources for decolonial thought.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops the concept of "critical public policy" for Latin America based on Dussel's ethics and politics of liberation. Constructs a conceptual model from Dussel's thought, interrogates traditional public policy in the form of the rational model of policy analysis, and defines characteristics that a critical public policy should have. Argues that Dussel's framework can ground an alternative approach to public policy that centers the excluded and challenges technocratic rationality.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the framework and limits of political action from the perspectives of Franz Hinkelammert and Enrique Dussel. Both thinkers critique the fetishization of political and economic systems that subordinate human life to abstract institutional imperatives. Examines how Dussel and Hinkelammert theorize the conditions for political action oriented toward life rather than system reproduction, and the structural limits imposed by fetishized institutions.

  RELEVANCE: Important comparative study connecting Dussel to another major Latin American liberation theorist (Hinkelammert). Shows convergence on critique of fetishism and affirmation of corporeal life as criterion for political action. Relevant for understanding how Dussel's political philosophy engages with theological-economic critiques of neoliberalism and theorizes conditions for transformative political action.

  POSITION: Comparative analysis treating both Dussel and Hinkelammert as complementary critics of fetishized political-economic systems; emphasizes their shared commitment to life-centered political philosophy.

  title = {Decolonizing Ethics: The Critical Theory of Enrique Dussel},
  year = {2021},
  publisher = {Pennsylvania State University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Edited volume collecting critical essays on Dussel's ethics and political philosophy from leading scholars. Contributors examine Dussel's engagement with critical theory, his decolonial critique of European philosophy, and the viability of his liberationist project. Includes essays on Dussel's dialogue with Apel, Levinas, Foucault, and contemporary critical theory, as well as assessments of his political theology and transmodernity concept.

  RELEVANCE: Major English-language scholarly engagement with Dussel's work. Important for understanding how North American and European scholars assess Dussel's contribution to critical theory and decolonial thought. Multiple essays address his political philosophy specifically, including treatments of potentia/potestas, obediential power, and transmodernity.

  POSITION: Edited volume with multiple perspectives; generally sympathetic but includes critical assessments of limitations and tensions in Dussel's project.

  volume = {8},
  number = {15},
  pages = {215--244},
  doi = {10.5209/ltdl.66108},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares Dussel and Bolívar Echeverría as critical theorists of modernity from Latin American perspectives. Both critique Eurocentrism and theorize modernity's relationship to colonialism and capitalism, but differ in their proposed alternatives. Echeverría focuses on cultural ethos and the baroque as space of resistance, while Dussel emphasizes exteriority and transmodernity. Examines convergences and divergences in their accounts of modernity-coloniality.

  RELEVANCE: Important comparative study situating Dussel within broader Latin American critical theory of modernity. Shows how different Latin American thinkers theorize the relationship between modernity and coloniality, and whether alternatives lie in internal critique (Echeverría) or external position (Dussel). Relevant for assessing the specificity of Dussel's transmodernity concept.

  POSITION: Balanced comparison treating both Echeverría and Dussel as important critical theorists while noting their different strategies for theorizing and challenging Eurocentric modernity.

  pages = {1--28},
  url = {http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/Vol18/Liberalism.pdf},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares Rorty's liberal ironism with Dussel's philosophy of liberation as competing utopian political visions. Argues that both offer radical critiques of existing political arrangements but from opposed starting points—Rorty from within Western liberalism, Dussel from exteriority to European modernity. Examines whether these positions are mutually exclusive or can be brought into productive dialogue.

  RELEVANCE: Rare English-language engagement placing Dussel in direct dialogue with contemporary Anglo-American political philosophy (Rorty). Important for assessing whether Dussel's critique of liberalism and liberal democracy is compatible with pragmatist appropriations of liberal institutions, or whether his philosophy of liberation requires wholesale rejection of liberal political forms.

  POSITION: Comparative assessment treating both Rorty and Dussel as offering valuable but potentially incompatible political visions; questions whether liberalism and liberation can be reconciled.

  pages = {63--103},
  doi = {10.3366/film.2016.0005},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies Dussel's concept of transmodernity to film analysis, developing a "cine-ethics for the Anthropocene" based on Dussel's ethics of liberation. Examines how South Korean and other Global South films represent ecological encounters that challenge Eurocentric modernity's extractive relationship to nature. Argues that Dussel's transmodernity offers resources for thinking beyond anthropocentrism while remaining grounded in liberation of oppressed peoples.

  RELEVANCE: Creative application of Dussel's transmodernity to cultural and ecological analysis. Shows how Dussel's political-ethical framework extends beyond traditional political philosophy to address ecological crisis. Relevant for understanding transmodernity's breadth and whether it offers resources for thinking human-nature relations beyond European frameworks.

  POSITION: Sympathetic appropriation of Dussel for film-philosophy and environmental thought; extends transmodernity beyond Dussel's own formulations.

  abstract = {This article explores the usefulness of Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel's work for film-philosophy, as the field increasingly engages with a world of cinemas. The piece concludes with an analysis of two films with an ecological focus, Trolljegeren/Troll Hunter (2010) and The Hunter (2011). They are indicative of a much broader emerging trend in ecocinema that explores the interaction between humanity and the environment in relation to world history, and which does so by staging encounters between people and those ‘nonhuman’ aspects of the Earth excluded by coloniality/modernity (e.g. animals, animal-spirits, mythological creatures, shaman, the very Earth itself). The interdisciplinary concerns of this work place it at the intersection of the latest research into a world of cinemas (in particular the various moves to understand films beyond the national paradigm now increasingly labelled the ‘transnational turn’; alongside growing concerns with how cinema helps us engage with ecology); and the ne...},

  publisher = {Pennsylvania State University Press},
  pages = {89--112},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Dussel's method of "analectics" as alternative to Hegelian dialectics. Argues that while dialectics proceeds through internal negation and sublation, analectics begins from the revelation of the Other who stands outside the totality. This methodological difference grounds Dussel's political philosophy: politics must begin from the exteriority of the excluded rather than from immanent contradictions of existing institutions.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding the philosophical method underlying Dussel's political philosophy. The analeptic method—beginning from the Other's revelation rather than systemic contradiction—provides the basis for Dussel's critique of Eurocentric political theory that starts from constituted political orders. Relevant for assessing whether Dussel's method successfully escapes Hegelian-Marxist frameworks or remains dialectical.

  POSITION: Sympathetic reconstruction of Dussel's method; treats analectics as viable alternative to dialectics while noting philosophical challenges in grounding politics in revelation of exteriority.

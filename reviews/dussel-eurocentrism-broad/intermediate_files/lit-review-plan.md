# Literature Review Plan: Enrique Dussel's Account of Eurocentrism

## Research Idea Summary

This literature review maps and organizes existing scholarship on Enrique Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism across his philosophy, with emphasis on Spanish-language secondary literature. The review will clarify what Dussel means by "Eurocentrism," how he diagnoses it, and what conceptual and political problems he identifies. Language priorities: Spanish (primary focus), English (secondary), Portuguese (if central and frequent).

## Key Research Questions

1. What does Dussel mean by "Eurocentrism" and how does this concept function across different areas of his philosophy (ethics, political theory, epistemology, critique of modernity)?
2. What are Dussel's core arguments for diagnosing Eurocentrism in philosophy, ethics, and politics?
3. What conceptual and political problems does Dussel argue Eurocentrism generates?
4. How has secondary scholarship interpreted, extended, critiqued, or applied Dussel's account of Eurocentrism?
5. What are the main clusters of interpretation, recurring themes, disagreements, and gaps in the existing literature?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Critique of Modernity and the "Myth of Modernity"

**Focus**: Dussel's historical-philosophical critique of the dominant narrative of modernity as originating in Europe (Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment) and his counter-narrative emphasizing 1492, colonialism, and the invention of the concept of "Europe."

**Rationale**: This domain captures Dussel's foundational diagnosis of Eurocentrism as embedded in how modernity itself is conceptualized and periodized. The "myth of modernity" thesis is central to understanding his broader critique. This cluster likely overlaps significantly with Domain 2 (ethics) and Domain 5 (universalism), but merits separate treatment because it includes substantial historical-philosophical and historiographical work.

**Key Questions**:
- How does Dussel's periodization of modernity (1492 vs. intra-European origins) challenge Eurocentric narratives?
- What role does the conquest of the Americas play in Dussel's account of modernity's "dark side"?
- How does Dussel critique Habermas, Hegel, and other European theorists of modernity?
- What is the relationship between modernity, rationality, and the "irrational myth" of sacrificial violence?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: *1492: El encubrimiento del Otro* (1992), *The Invention of the Americas* (English trans.), *Ética de la liberación* (1998), essays in *Filosofía de la liberación* (1977), *Transmodernidad e interculturalidad* (2005)
- Key terms (Spanish): "mito de la modernidad," "encubrimiento del otro," "eurocentrismo," "1492," "conquista de América," "transmodernidad," "colonialidad," "centro-periferia," "Dussel modernidad"
- Key terms (English): "myth of modernity," "invention of the Americas," "Eurocentrism Dussel," "1492 philosophy," "Dussel Habermas," "transmodernity," "underside of modernity"
- Expected sources: Journal articles in *Utopía y Praxis Latinoamericana*, *Tabula Rasa*, *Estudios de Filosofía Práctica e Historia de las Ideas*, *Erasmus*, edited volumes on Latin American philosophy, critical responses to Dussel's Habermas critique, secondary literature on decolonial thought
- Skill scripts: Use `search_philpapers.py` for English philosophical literature; `search_openalex.py` and `s2_search.py` with Spanish keywords for broader coverage; `search_sep.py` for entries on "Latin American Philosophy," "Colonialism"; consider Brave web search for Spanish-language university repositories and open-access journals

**Relevance to Project**: Provides the historical-philosophical foundation for Dussel's concept of Eurocentrism.

**Expected Papers**: 15-20 sources

---

### Domain 2: Ethics of Liberation and Eurocentrism

**Focus**: How Dussel's ethics of liberation diagnoses and responds to Eurocentrism in moral philosophy, particularly critiques of universalist ethics (Kant, Apel, Habermas) and the centrality of the "Other" and exteriority.

**Rationale**: The ethics of liberation is Dussel's most systematic philosophical project and contains his most developed critique of Eurocentric moral universalism. This domain covers his engagement with discourse ethics, Levinasian alterity, and the ethical implications of the center-periphery structure. Overlaps with Domain 5 (universalism) but focuses specifically on ethical theory.

**Key Questions**:
- How does Dussel critique Kantian and discourse-ethical universalism as Eurocentric?
- What role does the concept of "exteriority" (exterioridad) and "the Other" play in diagnosing Eurocentrism?
- How does Dussel's ethics respond to the accusation of relativism or particularism?
- What is the relationship between ethical critique and material conditions (poverty, exclusion, colonialism)?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: *Ética de la liberación en la edad de la globalización y de la exclusión* (1998), *Philosophy of Liberation* (English trans.), *Para una ética de la liberación latinoamericana* (5 vols., 1973-1980), essays on discourse ethics and Levinas
- Key terms (Spanish): "ética de la liberación," "alteridad," "exterioridad," "víctima," "eurocentrismo ético," "Dussel Apel," "Dussel Levinas," "universalismo," "válido universal," "principio liberación"
- Key terms (English): "ethics of liberation," "Dussel ethics," "exteriority," "alterity," "victim," "Eurocentric ethics," "Dussel discourse ethics," "Dussel Levinas," "universal validity"
- Expected sources: Monographs on Dussel's ethics (especially Spanish doctoral theses and books from university presses in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia), journal articles in *Stromata*, *Isegoria*, *Dianoia*, *Philosophy and Social Criticism*, critical essays in edited volumes on liberation philosophy
- Skill scripts: `search_philpapers.py` for ethical theory; `search_openalex.py` with institutional filters for Latin American universities; `s2_search.py` with author:"Dussel" filters; check NDPR via `search_ndpr.py` for book reviews

**Relevance to Project**: Central to understanding Dussel's philosophical critique of Eurocentrism in normative theory.

**Expected Papers**: 18-25 sources

---

### Domain 3: Epistemology, Philosophy of Liberation, and Geopolitics of Knowledge

**Focus**: Dussel's epistemological critique of Eurocentrism, including his account of how knowledge production is shaped by geopolitical location, the concept of "epistemic privilege of the oppressed," and connections to decolonial epistemology.

**Rationale**: Dussel's work on epistemology is less systematized than his ethics but is crucial for understanding his diagnosis of how Eurocentrism operates in philosophy itself. This domain captures his claims about the situatedness of reason, the "geopolitics of knowledge," and his engagement with Marxist, dependency theory, and world-systems analysis. Likely significant overlap with decolonial theorists (Quijano, Mignolo, Castro-Gómez) who cite Dussel.

**Key Questions**:
- What does Dussel mean by the "geopolitics of knowledge" and how does it relate to Eurocentrism?
- How does Dussel critique "abstract" or "disembodied" reason as Eurocentric?
- What is the relationship between Dussel's epistemology and dependency theory or world-systems analysis?
- How does Dussel's epistemology relate to other decolonial thinkers (Quijano's "coloniality of power," Mignolo's "border thinking")?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: *Filosofía de la liberación* (1977), *Política de la liberación* Vol. 1 (2007), essays on method and epistemology, chapters on world-system and dependency theory
- Key terms (Spanish): "geopolítica del conocimiento," "filosofía de la liberación," "colonialidad del saber," "razón moderna," "periferia," "dependencia," "sistema-mundo," "Dussel epistemología"
- Key terms (English): "geopolitics of knowledge," "philosophy of liberation," "coloniality of knowledge," "epistemic privilege," "Dussel epistemology," "world-systems philosophy," "dependency theory philosophy"
- Expected sources: Articles in *Tabula Rasa*, *Nómadas*, *Revista de Filosofía* (Chile/Venezuela), books on decolonial theory that discuss Dussel (Mignolo, Maldonado-Torres, Grosfoguel), doctoral dissertations, edited volumes on epistemologies of the South
- Skill scripts: `search_openalex.py` and `s2_search.py` with decolonial keywords; `search_core.py` for open-access theses; Brave search for Spanish university repositories; `search_sep.py` for "Epistemology" and "Social Epistemology" entries as context

**Relevance to Project**: Essential for understanding how Dussel diagnoses Eurocentrism as an epistemic phenomenon, not just ethical or political.

**Expected Papers**: 12-18 sources

---

### Domain 4: Political Philosophy, Democracy, and Transmodernity

**Focus**: Dussel's political philosophy, including his critique of liberal democracy as Eurocentric, his concept of "hyperpotentia" and popular power, and his vision of transmodernity as a non-Eurocentric political project.

**Rationale**: Dussel's political writings engage explicitly with the Eurocentrism of liberal political theory, representative democracy, and the nation-state model. His two-volume *Política de la liberación* (2007, 2009) and his writings on popular movements provide a sustained political application of his critique. This domain is distinct from Domain 2 (ethics) but overlaps in normative foundations.

**Key Questions**:
- How does Dussel critique liberal democracy and the social contract tradition as Eurocentric?
- What is Dussel's account of "potentia" vs. "potestas" and how does it relate to Eurocentrism?
- How does Dussel's political philosophy engage with Latin American popular movements and anti-colonial struggles?
- What does "transmodernity" mean as a political project and how does it differ from postmodernity or alternative modernities?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: *Política de la liberación* Vols. 1-2 (2007, 2009), *20 Tesis de política* (2006), essays on democracy and popular power, writings on Zapatismo and Latin American left governments
- Key terms (Spanish): "política de la liberación," "hiperpotentia," "poder popular," "democracia liberal," "transmodernidad política," "Dussel democracia," "pueblo," "obediencial," "fetichismo poder"
- Key terms (English): "politics of liberation," "hyperpotentia," "popular power," "Dussel democracy," "transmodernity," "obediential power," "fetishism of power," "Dussel political philosophy"
- Expected sources: Political theory journals (*Constellations*, *Philosophy and Social Criticism*, *Critical Horizons*), Spanish-language political philosophy journals (*Andamios*, *Encrucijadas*), books on Latin American political thought, critical essays on Dussel and Schmitt/Agamben, articles on Dussel and social movements
- Skill scripts: `search_philpapers.py` for political philosophy; `search_openalex.py` with "political" filters; `s2_search.py` with recent flag for contemporary debates; `search_ndpr.py` for reviews of *Política de la liberación*

**Relevance to Project**: Shows how Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism extends to concrete political institutions and projects.

**Expected Papers**: 15-20 sources

---

### Domain 5: Universalism, Particularity, and Intercultural Dialogue

**Focus**: Debates about whether Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism leads to relativism, how he navigates universalism and particularity, and his proposals for intercultural philosophy and "analogical" or "pluriversal" universality.

**Rationale**: This is a cross-cutting theme that appears in ethics, political philosophy, and epistemology, but merits separate treatment because it addresses a central tension in Dussel's work and a major point of debate among interpreters. The question of how to critique Eurocentric universalism without collapsing into relativism is crucial. This domain overlaps significantly with Domains 2 and 4 but focuses specifically on the universalism debate.

**Key Questions**:
- How does Dussel respond to the charge that his critique of Eurocentrism entails relativism?
- What does Dussel mean by "analogical" or "pluriversal" universality?
- How does Dussel's account of intercultural dialogue (trans-modernity, interculturalidad) address the tension between universal and particular?
- How do interpreters disagree about whether Dussel successfully escapes the relativism-universalism dilemma?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: *Transmodernidad e interculturalidad* (2005), chapters in *Ética de la liberación* on validity and consensus, essays on intercultural philosophy, debates with Apel and Habermas
- Key terms (Spanish): "universalismo analógico," "pluriversalidad," "interculturalidad," "transmodernidad," "relativismo," "Dussel Apel debate," "diálogo intercultural," "universalismo concreto"
- Key terms (English): "analogical universality," "pluriversality," "transmodernity," "intercultural dialogue," "Dussel universalism," "Dussel relativism," "concrete universality"
- Expected sources: Philosophical articles debating Dussel's position, comparative essays (Dussel and Apel, Dussel and Habermas, Dussel and postcolonial theory), chapters in books on intercultural philosophy, Latin American philosophy collections
- Skill scripts: `search_philpapers.py` for debates on universalism; `search_openalex.py` for "universalism" + "Dussel"; `s2_search.py` for citation networks around key debates; `search_sep.py` for "Relativism," "Multiculturalism" entries as background

**Relevance to Project**: Addresses a core philosophical problem in Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism and a major site of interpretive disagreement.

**Expected Papers**: 10-15 sources

---

### Domain 6: Reception, Critiques, and Debates

**Focus**: Critical responses to Dussel's account of Eurocentrism from various perspectives: Marxist critiques, liberal responses, postcolonial/decolonial debates, feminist interventions, and internal disagreements within liberation philosophy.

**Rationale**: This domain maps the critical landscape rather than a thematic area of Dussel's work. It includes scholars who argue Dussel overstates Eurocentrism, those who argue he remains too Eurocentric, and substantive philosophical disagreements about method, periodization, or political implications. This is essential for identifying gaps and showing the review is balanced and critical.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the main objections to Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism?
- How do Marxist critics assess Dussel's diagnosis (e.g., does he underplay class in favor of geography)?
- How do feminist philosophers engage with or critique Dussel's approach to Eurocentrism?
- How do other decolonial thinkers position themselves relative to Dussel?
- What do liberal or analytic philosophers say about Dussel's arguments?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: N/A (this domain focuses on secondary literature)
- Key terms (Spanish): "crítica Dussel," "Dussel marxismo," "Dussel feminismo," "límites filosofía liberación," "Dussel debate," "colonialidad vs. Dussel"
- Key terms (English): "critique of Dussel," "Dussel limitations," "Dussel debate," "Dussel feminism," "Dussel Marxism," "postcolonial vs. decolonial"
- Expected sources: Critical book reviews (NDPR, *Bulletin of Latin American Research*), essays in *Hypatia*, *Radical Philosophy*, *Historical Materialism*, polemical exchanges, dissertations comparing Dussel to Said, Spivak, or Fanon
- Skill scripts: `search_ndpr.py` for critical reviews; `search_philpapers.py` with "critique" and "debate" keywords; `s2_search.py` for papers citing Dussel critically; Brave search for blog posts or non-indexed critical essays

**Relevance to Project**: Ensures the review represents disagreements, limitations, and alternative perspectives; essential for comprehensive and balanced coverage.

**Expected Papers**: 12-18 sources

---

### Domain 7: Comparative and Contextual Studies

**Focus**: Scholarship that situates Dussel in broader intellectual contexts: comparisons with other Latin American philosophers (Zea, Salazar Bondy, Kusch), connections to dependency theory and world-systems analysis (Frank, Wallerstein), engagement with European interlocutors (Levinas, Ricoeur, Apel, Habermas), and relationship to decolonial studies (Quijano, Mignolo).

**Rationale**: This domain captures secondary literature that interprets Dussel by placing him in dialogue with other traditions and thinkers. It is not strictly about Eurocentrism but illuminates how scholars understand the origins, influences, and distinctiveness of Dussel's critique. This cluster could potentially be merged with Domain 6 (reception) or split further (Latin American context vs. European interlocutors vs. decolonial studies), depending on what literature emerges.

**Key Questions**:
- How does Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism relate to earlier Latin American debates (Zea's "original philosophy," Salazar Bondy's "authentic philosophy")?
- What is the relationship between Dussel's philosophy and dependency theory or world-systems analysis?
- How do scholars interpret Dussel's engagement with Levinas, and does it introduce Eurocentric elements into his thought?
- How is Dussel positioned within decolonial studies (as founder, interlocutor, or contested figure)?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Dussel's writings on Levinas, essays on liberation philosophy's history, introductions to his major works
- Key terms (Spanish): "Dussel Levinas," "Dussel dependencia," "Dussel Wallerstein," "filosofía latinoamericana," "Dussel Zea," "Dussel Quijano," "estudios decoloniales," "Dussel contexto"
- Key terms (English): "Dussel Levinas," "Dussel world-systems," "Dussel dependency theory," "Latin American philosophy," "Dussel decolonial," "Dussel Quijano," "Dussel comparative"
- Expected sources: Monographs on Latin American philosophy (Cerutti Guldberg, Schutte, Mendieta), intellectual histories, comparative essays, introductions to edited volumes, chapters in handbooks (*Cambridge History of Philosophy in Latin America*, Routledge companions)
- Skill scripts: `search_philpapers.py` for comparative philosophy; `search_openalex.py` with author networks; `s2_search.py` for co-citation analysis; `search_sep.py` for "Latin American Philosophy" entry and references

**Relevance to Project**: Provides intellectual-historical context for understanding how Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism fits within and departs from other critical traditions.

**Expected Papers**: 10-15 sources

## Coverage Rationale

These seven domains provide comprehensive coverage of Dussel's account of Eurocentrism while remaining flexible and responsive to what literature actually exists. The domains are organized thematically rather than rigidly, allowing for:

1. **Thematic coherence**: Each domain corresponds to a major area of Dussel's philosophy or a significant interpretive question.
2. **Overlap and cross-reference**: Domains 2, 4, and 5 overlap significantly (ethics, politics, universalism), but each has a distinct focus that justifies separate treatment. Synthesis planning will determine whether to merge or maintain distinctions.
3. **Critical balance**: Domain 6 (reception/critiques) ensures the review does not become hagiographic and represents objections and limitations.
4. **Contextual grounding**: Domain 7 situates Dussel historically and comparatively, preventing an acontextual reading.
5. **Language diversity**: All domains prioritize Spanish-language scholarship, with English as secondary and Portuguese if relevant. Search strategies include terms in both languages.

The structure is designed for a "mapping pass": researchers will report back on what literature exists, and the synthesis planner will adjust the outline based on actual findings rather than imposed structure.

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary expectations for gaps (to be confirmed or revised after research phase):

1. **Thin English secondary literature**: Dussel's work may be under-discussed in Anglophone philosophy, requiring reliance on translations of Spanish sources or supplementary contextual reading.
2. **Limited engagement with analytic philosophy**: Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism may not have received sustained responses from analytic philosophers, creating an imbalance in critical perspectives.
3. **Under-theorized connections**: The relationship between Dussel's ethics and his political philosophy, or between his epistemology and his critique of modernity, may be asserted more than argued in secondary literature.
4. **Feminist critiques**: There may be limited feminist engagement with Dussel's work, either affirming or critiquing his account of Eurocentrism.
5. **Reception outside philosophy**: Dussel's influence in theology, political theory, and cultural studies may exceed his reception in philosophy proper, requiring decisions about scope.

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 7 (flexible; may consolidate to 5-6 or expand to 8 depending on findings)
- **Estimated sources**: 60-100 total (92-131 based on domain estimates above; adjust after mapping)
- **Language distribution**: 60-70% Spanish, 30-40% English, <5% Portuguese
- **Key positions to cover**:
  - Dussel's own account of Eurocentrism (definitional, diagnostic, normative)
  - Sympathetic extensions (decolonial studies, liberation theology, dependency theory)
  - Critical responses (Marxist, liberal, feminist, postcolonial)
  - Interpretive debates (universalism/relativism, relationship to European philosophy, originality vs. derivative)

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Dussel's major books (*Ética de la liberación*, *Política de la liberación*, *Filosofía de la liberación*, *1492*) in Spanish originals; key secondary monographs and PhD theses.
2. **Spanish-language journals**: Prioritize peer-reviewed journals published in Latin America (*Utopía y Praxis Latinoamericana*, *Tabula Rasa*, *Stromata*, *Dianoia*, *Isegoria*, *Andamios*).
3. **Recent developments**: Use `--recent` flag to capture last 10-15 years of scholarship, especially post-decolonial turn in philosophy.
4. **Critical responses**: Actively search for critiques, objections, and debates (use "critique," "límites," "debate" keywords).
5. **Book reviews**: Check NDPR, *Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews*, and Spanish-language review journals for critical assessments of Dussel's major works.
6. **Edited volumes**: Search for chapters in edited collections on Latin American philosophy, liberation philosophy, decolonial studies.
7. **Citation networks**: Use Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex citation graphs to find secondary literature citing Dussel's primary works.

## Notes for Researchers

**Use philosophy-research skill scripts extensively**:
- `search_philpapers.py` for English-language philosophical literature (especially ethics, political philosophy, epistemology categories)
- `search_openalex.py` for broad coverage, including Spanish-language sources; use institutional filters for Latin American universities
- `s2_search.py` for citation networks and recent papers; use `--recent` flag for last 10-15 years; filter by author:"Dussel" to find secondary literature
- `search_sep.py` and `search_iep.py` for foundational context (Latin American Philosophy, Colonialism, Relativism, Social Epistemology)
- `search_ndpr.py` for critical book reviews of Dussel's major works
- `search_core.py` for open-access theses and dissertations
- `search_arxiv.py` less relevant (philosophy not well-represented), but try for recent interdisciplinary work
- Brave web search (`brave_search.py`) for Spanish-language university repositories, open-access journals not indexed in major databases, and grey literature

**Language and access**:
- Many Spanish-language journals are open access; use `search_core.py` and institutional repositories
- Request abstracts in Spanish and English where available
- For sources behind paywalls, note bibliographic details and assess relevance from abstracts

**Validation**:
- Verify all citations using `verify_citation.py` (CrossRef DOI lookup)
- Enrich BibTeX entries with `enrich_bibliography.py` after initial collection
- Use `resolve_abstract.py` to retrieve abstracts for assessment

**Critical representation**:
- Actively seek out critiques, objections, and limitations (Domain 6 is essential)
- Do not assume Dussel's account is correct; map the debate, not just the position
- Include sources that argue Dussel overstates Eurocentrism, remains Eurocentric, or misdiagnoses the problem

**Scope boundaries**:
- Focus on *philosophical* secondary literature; theology, political theory, and cultural studies are supplementary unless they engage philosophically with Eurocentrism
- Primary sources by Dussel are anchors for context but not the main object; the task is to map *secondary literature*
- If Portuguese sources appear frequently and are central, include them; otherwise, prioritize Spanish and English

**Flexibility**:
- Report back on what literature exists and recommend domain adjustments (merges, splits, new clusters)
- If certain domains yield thin results, say so explicitly and propose reallocation of search effort
- If unexpected clusters emerge (e.g., Dussel on ecology, Dussel on technology), flag them for synthesis planner

**Source cap**: Aim for 60-100 sources total. Prioritize quality, relevance, and diversity of perspectives over sheer quantity.

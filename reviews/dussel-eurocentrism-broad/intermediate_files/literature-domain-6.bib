====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines critical responses to Dussel's account of Eurocentrism
from multiple perspectives within and beyond liberation philosophy. The
critiques cluster around three main issues: (1) methodological concerns about
Dussel's reliance on European philosophical frameworks despite his anti-
Eurocentric aims (Vargas, Irvine); (2) feminist interrogations of gender
essentialism and the construction of indigenous peoples in Dussel's theory
(Lange, Vuola); and (3) internal decolonial debates about the relationship
between liberation, democracy, and transmodernity (Castro-Gomez, Diaz
Fernandez). Marxist critiques appear less prominently in Anglophone
literature than feminist and methodological challenges. The edited volume
"Thinking from the Underside of History" (Alcoff & Mendieta, 2000) remains
the central text collecting diverse critical engagements with Dussel's work,
featuring contributions from Karl-Otto Apel, Lynda Lange, and others.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These critiques reveal the contested terrain of Dussel's Eurocentrism account
and illuminate where his philosophy of liberation remains vulnerable to
charges of performative contradiction (using European tools to critique
Europe), gender blindness, and ontological essentialism. Understanding these
debates is essential for assessing the coherence and limits of Dussel's
critique of Eurocentric modernity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Marxist critiques in English are underrepresented; most appear in Spanish-
language sources (e.g., Cerutti's work). Debates between postcolonial and
decolonial thinkers regarding Dussel's positioning appear primarily in
comparative frameworks rather than direct critical engagement. Few analytic
philosophers have engaged Dussel's work critically (Irvine is an exception).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize critiques by type (methodological, feminist, internal decolonial,
Marxist) rather than chronologically. Highlight the "Eurocentrism Problem"
(Vargas) as a central methodological challenge. Consider how feminist critics
(Lange, Vuola) expand the scope of critique beyond epistemology to gender
and sexuality. Note the productive tension between Dussel and Castro-Gomez
on transmodernity and democracy.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Methodological critique (Eurocentrism Problem): 3 papers - Charges Dussel with performative contradiction
- Feminist critique: 2 papers - Challenges gender essentialism and indigenous representation
- Internal decolonial debate: 4 papers - Contests Dussel's populism and transmodernity
- Analytic/ontological critique: 2 papers - Questions trans-ontology and analectic method
- Sympathetic engagement: 6 papers - Critical dialogue from within liberation tradition

@article{Vargas2005,
  author = {Vargas, Manuel},
  title = {Eurocentrism and the Philosophy of Liberation},
  journal = {APA Newsletter on Hispanic/Latino Issues},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {4},
  number = {2},
  pages = {8--17},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vargas argues that liberation philosophy faces a fundamental methodological problem: despite aiming to overcome Eurocentrism, its practitioners rely heavily on European philosophical frameworks (Levinas, Marx, Heidegger, discourse ethics). This "Eurocentrism Problem" reveals a disconnect between the aims (anti-Eurocentrism) and methods (European conceptual apparatus) of liberation philosophy, particularly in Dussel's work, and reflects deeper flaws in the program's coherence.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most influential Anglophone critique of Dussel's methodology. Vargas identifies what he calls "The Eurocentrism Problem" as a performative contradiction at the heart of liberation philosophy. The critique is central to understanding whether Dussel's use of European philosophy undermines his anti-Eurocentric project or whether such use can be justified as strategic appropriation. Vargas's challenge has not received an adequate reply from liberation philosophers.

  POSITION: Represents a sympathetic but critical analytic philosopher perspective. Vargas takes liberation philosophy seriously but argues its internal contradictions have not been adequately addressed. His critique operates from within Anglo-American philosophical methodology, raising questions about coherence and consistency.

  title = {Burnt Offerings to Rationality: A Feminist Reading of the Construction of Indigenous Peoples in Enrique Dussel's Theory of Modernity},
  journal = {Hypatia},
  year = {1998},
  volume = {13},
  number = {3},
  pages = {132--145},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1527-2001.1998.tb01374.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lange provides a feminist critique of Dussel's construction of indigenous peoples in his theory of modernity. She argues that Dussel's "transmodern" framework, while critical of European colonial constructions, nevertheless relies on problematic essentializations of indigenous identity. Lange contends that Dussel's approach risks reducing indigenous peoples to symbols in a philosophical narrative rather than recognizing their complex historical agency and diverse experiences. She questions whether modernism and postmodernism should be as sharply distinguished as Dussel suggests.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most sustained feminist critique of Dussel's treatment of indigenous peoples and gender in the "Thinking from the Underside of History" volume. Lange's critique is essential for understanding how Dussel's philosophy of liberation has been received by feminist scholars who argue that his framework, despite its liberatory aims, reproduces problematic gender and colonial assumptions. The critique raises questions about whether Dussel's transmodernity adequately attends to intersectional oppressions.

  POSITION: Represents feminist philosophy's critique of liberation philosophy's gender blindness. Lange operates from feminist epistemology and postcolonial feminist theory, arguing that Dussel's framework needs feminist correctives to avoid essentializing indigenous identity and ignoring gender as constitutive of colonial domination.

  title = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume collects critical essays on Dussel's philosophy of liberation from diverse perspectives: Karl-Otto Apel on discourse ethics and liberation, Lynda Lange on feminist critique of Dussel's construction of indigenous peoples, Elina Vuola on feminism and liberation theology, Walter Mignolo on geopolitics of knowledge, Michael D. Barber on Dussel's use of Marx and Marion, Mario Saenz on living labor, and Linda Martin Alcoff on Dussel and Foucault. The volume represents the most comprehensive Anglophone critical engagement with Dussel's work through 2000.

  RELEVANCE: This is the single most important collection of critical responses to Dussel in English. It brings together methodological, feminist, theological, and philosophical critiques from scholars working in analytic philosophy (Apel), feminist theory (Lange, Vuola), postcolonial studies (Mignolo), and phenomenology (Barber). The volume is essential for understanding the range of critical perspectives on Dussel's liberation philosophy and provides the foundation for subsequent Anglophone engagement with his work.

  POSITION: Represents critical dialogue from within and adjacent to liberation philosophy. Contributors are generally sympathetic to decolonial and liberatory projects but raise substantive concerns about Dussel's methods, gender politics, and philosophical assumptions. The volume models productive critical engagement rather than dismissive rejection.

@article{Irvine2011,
  author = {Irvine, Andrew B.},
  title = {An Ontological Critique of the Trans-Ontology of Enrique Dussel},
  journal = {Sophia},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {50},
  number = {4},
  pages = {603--624},
  doi = {10.1007/s11841-010-0210-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Irvine offers an ontological critique of Dussel's "trans-ontology" and analectic method. He questions whether Dussel's analectic approach genuinely goes beyond Western thinking about being, as Dussel claims. Irvine proposes an ontological critique that is "classically Western" yet "classically relevant" even in the context of globalization and exclusion. He argues that Dussel's attempt to move beyond ontology to ethics of the Other does not escape the conceptual frameworks of Western metaphysics.

  RELEVANCE: This is a rare analytic philosopher's engagement with Dussel's core methodological claims about trans-ontology and analectics. Irvine's critique challenges whether Dussel's philosophical innovation (moving beyond ontology through the ethical relation to the Other) succeeds or whether it remains captive to the Western philosophical tradition it seeks to transcend. The critique raises fundamental questions about the coherence of Dussel's philosophical method.

  POSITION: Represents an analytic philosopher's skepticism about continental and Latin American philosophy's attempts to transcend Western ontology. Irvine argues for the continuing relevance of "historically Western" yet "classically relevant" ontological frameworks, implicitly questioning the necessity and success of Dussel's decolonial philosophical project.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Diaz Fernandez presents a critical reading of Dussel's philosophy, examining the breaks and continuities between his early and mature ethical and political projects. The article explores Dussel's ethical and political positions, the relevance of Horacio Cerutti's critique, the structure of Dussel's mature ethics, his debate with Karl-Otto Apel, the architecture of his politics of liberation, and Santiago Castro-Gomez's critique. Diaz offers a secular and critical reading of one of the most important liberation philosophies in Latin America.

  RELEVANCE: This recent Spanish-language article provides a comprehensive overview of the main critiques Dussel has faced from within Latin American philosophy, including the important but underrepresented Cerutti critique and the Castro-Gomez debate. It demonstrates how internal decolonial debates continue to shape and challenge Dussel's project, particularly regarding populism, democracy, and the theological dimensions of liberation philosophy.

  POSITION: Represents internal Latin American critical philosophy perspective. Diaz examines Dussel sympathetically but critically, noting the theological residues in his ostensibly secular philosophy and the tensions between his ethical and political architectures. The article engages both Marxist (Cerutti) and decolonial (Castro-Gomez) critiques.

  author = {Vuola, Elina},
  editor = {Alcoff, Linda Mart{\'i}n and Mendieta, Eduardo},
  title = {Thinking Otherwise: Dussel, Liberation Theology, and Feminism},
  booktitle = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vuola examines the relationship between Dussel's liberation philosophy, liberation theology, and feminist thought. She argues that while liberation theology and philosophy have made important contributions to understanding structural oppression, they have often been gender-blind. Vuola explores how feminist theology and philosophy can engage productively with Dussel's work while critically addressing its limitations regarding gender and sexuality. She advocates for "thinking otherwise" - maintaining liberation philosophy's structural critique while incorporating feminist insights.

  RELEVANCE: Vuola's chapter is the most sustained engagement with Dussel from the perspective of feminist theology and philosophy. It demonstrates how feminist scholars working within liberatory traditions can simultaneously appreciate and critique Dussel's contributions. The chapter is essential for understanding the feminist reception of liberation philosophy and the debates about whether liberation theology/philosophy can be adequately reformed to address gender or whether feminist alternatives are needed.

  POSITION: Represents feminist theology and philosophy in critical dialogue with liberation theology/philosophy. Vuola operates from within liberatory traditions but insists on the centrality of gender analysis. She argues for productive engagement rather than wholesale rejection, modeling how feminist critique can strengthen rather than abandon liberation projects.

@article{Lozano2021,

  title = {Transmodernity: Method for a Decolonial Political Project. From Enrique Dussel to Santiago Castro-G{\'o}mez},
  journal = {Eidos},
  year = {2021},
  number = {34},
  pages = {199--225},
  doi = {10.14482/EIDOS.34.199.8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lozano analyzes how Santiago Castro-Gomez appropriates and transforms Dussel's concept of transmodernity to propose an emancipatory politics. While Dussel's transmodernity (1994) aims to overcome modernity as a sacrificial, Eurocentric myth through affirmation of universal cultural otherness (analectic method), Castro-Gomez adapts this into "transmodern republicanism." Lozano examines the modernity/coloniality dialogue between these two philosophers to show how transmodernity functions as a method for decolonial politics, taking modernity's rational character but opposing domination.

  RELEVANCE: This article illuminates the internal decolonial debate between Dussel's liberation philosophy and Castro-Gomez's critical adaptation of it. The debate centers on whether Dussel's populist politics of liberation adequately addresses power complexity or whether Castro-Gomez's republicanism offers a better framework. Understanding this disagreement is essential for grasping how Dussel's concepts have been critically appropriated and transformed within decolonial thought.

  POSITION: Represents internal decolonial debate perspective. Lozano examines how Castro-Gomez builds on yet departs from Dussel, particularly regarding populism, republicanism, and the structure of emancipatory politics. The article shows productive disagreement within the modernity/coloniality/decoloniality research program.

  abstract = {This article seeks to analyze how the sense of transmodernity is subsumed in phi- losopher Santiago Castro-Gómez, to propose an emancipatory policy. Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures —ana- lectic—. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity —its rational character—, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-Gómez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.},

@incollection{Barber2000a,
  author = {Barber, Michael D.},
  editor = {Alcoff, Linda Mart{\'i}n and Mendieta, Eduardo},
  title = {Theory and Alterity: Dussel's Marx and Marion on Idolatry},
  booktitle = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber compares Dussel's reading of Marx with Jean-Luc Marion's phenomenology of the idol/icon distinction, examining how both thinkers address the problem of totalization and the reduction of the Other. Barber argues that Dussel's appropriation of Marx through Levinas's ethics of alterity parallels Marion's critique of idolatry in metaphysics and theology. Both seek to preserve the transcendence of the Other against reductive theoretical frameworks that turn the infinite into a finite object of consciousness.

  RELEVANCE: Barber's chapter demonstrates how Dussel's philosophical method can be understood through comparison with contemporary phenomenology. The analysis helps clarify what is distinctive about Dussel's reading of Marx (via Levinas) and shows how Dussel's concerns about theoretical totalization connect to broader continental philosophical debates about alterity, phenomenology, and ethics. This positions Dussel within European philosophical conversations while highlighting his Latin American distinctiveness.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic phenomenological engagement with Dussel. Barber is one of the leading interpreters of Dussel in Anglophone philosophy and consistently works to make Dussel's thought accessible to continental philosophers. His approach is integrative rather than critical, showing connections between Dussel and European thinkers.

  booktitle = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mignolo situates Dussel's philosophy of liberation within the geopolitics of knowledge, arguing that Dussel's ethics emerges from a specific geopolitical location (Latin America) that has been historically marginalized in the global production of philosophy. Mignolo connects Dussel's work to the broader project of "border thinking" and the "colonial difference," showing how liberation philosophy challenges the Eurocentric geography of reason by thinking from the colonial periphery.

  RELEVANCE: Mignolo's chapter is essential for understanding how Dussel's work fits within the broader modernity/coloniality/decoloniality research program. It demonstrates how Dussel's ethics of liberation is not merely a regional variant of European philosophy but a fundamentally different epistemic project emerging from the colonial difference. This positioning is central to debates about whether Dussel overcomes Eurocentrism or remains captive to it.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic decolonial interpretation from within the modernity/coloniality research program. Mignolo is a colleague and collaborator of Dussel's who shares the project of epistemic decolonization. His chapter works to legitimate Dussel's philosophy as a genuine alternative to Eurocentric thought rather than a derivative application of European frameworks.

  booktitle = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Apel responds to Dussel's critique of discourse ethics, examining whether liberation ethics can be assimilated within discourse ethics or whether it requires a distinct framework. Apel defends discourse ethics against Dussel's charge that it is Eurocentric and insufficiently attentive to material conditions of discourse participants. He argues that discourse ethics already contains resources for addressing Dussel's concerns about victims, exclusion, and material prerequisites for genuine dialogue.

  RELEVANCE: This is Apel's direct response to Dussel's critique in "The Underside of Modernity" and represents one of the most important methodological debates in Dussel's work. The Dussel-Apel debate concerns whether formal discourse ethics can address material exclusion and whether liberation philosophy needs to go beyond procedural communicative rationality. Understanding this debate is essential for assessing Dussel's critique of Habermas and Apel.

  POSITION: Represents the European discourse ethics tradition defending itself against decolonial critique. Apel argues that Dussel misunderstands or underestimates the critical resources within discourse ethics. The exchange reveals fundamental disagreements about whether formal ethics can address material domination and whether European philosophical frameworks can be universalized.

  booktitle = {Thinking From the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Saenz examines Dussel's reading of Marx, focusing on the concept of "living labor" and how Dussel uses Marx to develop a materialist ethics grounded in the affirmation of life. Saenz shows how Dussel's interpretation of Marx differs from orthodox Marxism by centering the ethical relation to the worker as living subject rather than focusing exclusively on economic structures. Dussel reads Marx through Levinas, producing a synthesis of materialism and ethics of alterity.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter is important for understanding Dussel's relationship to Marxism and how his liberation philosophy engages with but transforms historical materialism. It addresses implicit Marxist critiques that Dussel abandons class analysis for cultural/ethical critique, showing instead how Dussel integrates materialist and ethical concerns. The chapter is essential for assessing whether Dussel's Marx is a distortion or a productive reading.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic interpretation of Dussel's Marx from within Latin American philosophy. Saenz works to show the coherence and originality of Dussel's synthesis of Marx and Levinas, defending it against both orthodox Marxist and liberal critics who see the combination as incoherent or reductive.

  journal = {Revista Ciencias y Humanidades},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.61497/kseaqj31},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Camelo argues that Santiago Castro-Gomez's critical engagements with Dussel - both agreements and disagreements - were fundamental in constructing Castro-Gomez's vision of "transmodern democracy." Camelo develops this thesis through critical dialogue between the two philosophers around three analytical keys: pueblo (people), democracia (democracy), and transmodernidad (transmodernity). He concludes that transmodernity is the convergent point between both philosophical proposals despite their differences on populism and democratic structure.

  RELEVANCE: This recent article illuminates the ongoing internal decolonial debate about democracy, populism, and emancipatory politics. It shows how Castro-Gomez critically appropriates Dussel's concept of transmodernity while rejecting Dussel's populist politics. The debate is essential for understanding disagreements within decolonial thought about the relationship between the people, power, and democratic institutions.

  POSITION: Represents internal decolonial debate from a Colombian philosophical perspective. Camelo examines the productive tension between Dussel's populist politics of liberation and Castro-Gomez's republican decolonial politics, showing how both build on yet contest each other's frameworks.

Dicho objetivo se pretende alcanzar a través de un diálogo crítico entre estos dos autores alrededor de tres claves analíticas, a saber, pueblo, democracia y transmodernidad.

  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield Publishers},
  year = {2000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendieta examines Dussel's critique of universal history and globalization, showing how Dussel challenges Eurocentric narratives that present European modernity as the telos of world history. Mendieta argues that Dussel's philosophy of liberation offers a counter-narrative that centers the experiences and perspectives of colonized peoples, revealing how "universal history" is actually a particular European story masquerading as global truth.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter is important for understanding Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism as fundamentally a critique of how history is narrated and universalized. Mendieta shows how Dussel's decolonial historiography connects to his broader ethical and political project. The chapter helps position Dussel's work in relation to debates about postcolonial history, subaltern studies, and the politics of historical representation.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic interpretation from a leading translator and interpreter of Dussel. Mendieta works to make Dussel's critique of universal history accessible to Anglophone readers and to show its relevance for contemporary debates about globalization, multiculturalism, and historical consciousness.

  number = {148},
  pages = {37--58},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pachon examines the relationship between historiography, Eurocentrism, and claims to universality in Dussel's work. He analyzes how Dussel's philosophy of liberation attempts to construct a non-Eurocentric universal history while avoiding both Eurocentric universalism and relativist particularism. Pachon explores the tensions in Dussel's project between critique of Eurocentric historiography and the construction of an alternative universal framework.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses a central tension in Dussel's work: how to critique Eurocentric universality while constructing a genuinely universal (rather than merely particular or regional) alternative. The question is whether Dussel's transmodernity is itself a form of universalism or an affirmation of pluriversality. Understanding this tension is essential for assessing Dussel's relationship to postmodern critiques of metanarratives.

  POSITION: Represents Latin American philosophical analysis examining internal tensions in Dussel's project. Pachon is sympathetic to Dussel's aims but questions whether the execution succeeds in escaping the problems it identifies in Eurocentric thought.

  doi = {10.1017/S0017816025000069},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hoston reconsiders sixteenth-century Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming's thought in light of twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology, particularly the work of Enrique Dussel and Jose Porfirio Miranda. She argues that Wang's Idealist Neo-Confucianism incorporates epistemological, spiritual, and ethical perspectives with powerful democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure Latin American liberation theology. Hoston identifies crucial contributions from Levinas's ethics of alterity that influenced both Dussel and Miranda's critiques of Christian orthodoxy.

  RELEVANCE: While not primarily a critique of Dussel, this comparative study positions Dussel's liberation theology/philosophy within a broader global context of liberationist thought. It demonstrates how Dussel's work can be productively compared with non-Western philosophical traditions and raises questions about whether liberation philosophy's insights are unique to Latin American contexts or have parallels in other traditions of resistance to orthodoxy and domination.

  POSITION: Represents comparative philosophy approach to liberation theology. Hoston examines Dussel's work to illuminate parallels with Neo-Confucian thought, implicitly suggesting that liberation philosophy's core insights may have transcultural resonance while being historically and geographically specific.

  abstract = {Abstract This article reconsiders the sixteenth-century Idealist Neo-Confucian philosophy of Wang Yangming (1472–1529) in light of the development of twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. After defining liberation theology, this study identifies the crucial contributions made to it by Emmanuel Levinas’s assertion of the primacy of ethics over ontology and critique of the egocentric nature of Western philosophy. It then delineates the epistemological and deontological criticisms made of Roman Catholic orthodoxy—and institutionalized Christianity in general—by Latin American liberation theologians, particularly Enrique Dussel and José Porfirio Miranda. These are compared with Wang’s critique of the Rationalist Neo-Confucianism that had been official orthodoxy and the legitimating philosophy for imperial China for three centuries. The study finds that Wang’s Idealist philosophy incorporates epistemological, spiritual, and ethical perspectives with powerful democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure the development of late-twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. Thus, contrary to the conventional view of Confucianism as a conservative philosophy, these elements in Wang’s Neo-Confucianism render it a theology (or philosophy) of liberation.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Alcoff stages a dialogue between Dussel's liberation philosophy and Foucault's genealogy of power/knowledge, examining how both thinkers analyze the relationship between knowledge production and domination. She argues that while Dussel and Foucault share concerns about how power operates through knowledge systems, they differ in their approaches to resistance and liberation. Alcoff explores what each thinker can learn from the other regarding the colonial unconscious and epistemic decolonization.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter is important for understanding how Dussel's work relates to poststructuralist critique, particularly Foucault's analysis of power/knowledge. It addresses questions about whether Dussel's ethics of liberation is compatible with or opposed to Foucauldian genealogy. The dialogue helps position Dussel in relation to debates about agency, resistance, and the possibility of liberation within poststructuralist frameworks.

  POSITION: Represents philosophical mediation between liberation philosophy and poststructuralism. Alcoff works to show productive tensions and possible syntheses between Dussel's ethics and Foucault's analytics of power, arguing that each tradition has insights the other needs.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mills provides a systematic introduction to Dussel's ethics of liberation, explaining its methodology, basic concepts, and architecture of three principles (material, formal, feasibility). Mills presents Dussel's ethics as a response to globalization and exclusion that places the ethical appeals of victims at the center of moral philosophy. He argues that Dussel's work is critical for understanding liberatory thought in Latin America and has urgent relevance for progressive political and economic theory in the Global North.

  RELEVANCE: While primarily expository rather than critical, Mills's introduction is important for understanding how Dussel's ethics has been received and interpreted by sympathetic Anglophone philosophers. Mills works to make Dussel accessible to North American audiences and to demonstrate the contemporary relevance of liberation ethics. The book represents the most comprehensive English-language introduction to Dussel's mature ethical system.

  POSITION: Represents sympathetic exposition and advocacy for Dussel's work from within progressive political philosophy. Mills aims to introduce Dussel to audiences who might dismiss liberation philosophy as regional or theological, arguing for its universal relevance and philosophical rigor.

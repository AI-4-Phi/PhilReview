====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain situates Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism in broader intellectual
contexts. The literature divides into four major comparative contexts: (1)
earlier Latin American philosophy debates on authenticity and originality (Zea,
Salazar Bondy), (2) dependency theory and world-systems analysis (Frank,
Wallerstein, Quijano), (3) European interlocutors on ethics and politics
(Levinas, Apel, Habermas), and (4) decolonial studies (Mignolo, Maldonado-Torres).
The SEP and IEP entries on Latin American philosophy provide crucial context
for understanding Dussel within the philosophy of liberation movement. Key
debates include whether Dussel's use of Levinas imports Eurocentric elements,
how his work relates to Marxist dependency theory, and his contested role as
founder vs. participant in decolonial studies.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These comparative studies reveal how Dussel's Eurocentrism critique emerged
from specific Latin American intellectual genealogies (particularly dependency
theory) while engaging critically with European philosophy. The debate over
whether Dussel's Levinas engagement is Eurocentric directly addresses the
project's central question about philosophical self-reference.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with Dussel's relationship to Salazar Bondy and Zea's
earlier authenticity debates. Few comparative studies with African or Asian
decolonial thinkers beyond brief mentions.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should trace Dussel's dual lineage from Latin American dependency
theory and European ethics, showing how these strands both support and
complicate his Eurocentrism critique. The Levinas debate is crucial for
understanding tensions in his work.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dussel as synthesis of Latin American and European traditions: 5 papers -
  Dussel integrates dependency theory with Levinas/discourse ethics
- Critical engagement position: 6 papers - Dussel's European interlocutors
  introduce Eurocentric elements
- Decolonial founder position: 4 papers - Dussel as foundational to decolonial
  studies alongside Quijano/Mignolo

@incollection{Vargas2005eurocentrism,
  author = {Vargas, Manuel},
  title = {Eurocentrism and the Philosophy of Liberation},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {4},
  number = {2},
  pages = {8--17},
  doi = {},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vargas argues that despite the philosophy of liberation's
  explicit condemnation of Eurocentrism, it paradoxically remains Eurocentric
  in its theoretical frameworks and conceptual apparatus. The philosophy of
  liberation fails to adequately examine how its own categories and methods
  reproduce European philosophical dominance even while critiquing colonialism.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the central paradox of Dussel's
  project examined in this review—whether a philosophy that critiques
  Eurocentrism can avoid Eurocentrism. Vargas's critique suggests that Dussel's
  use of European philosophy (particularly Levinas, Marx, and discourse ethics)
  undermines his anti-Eurocentric goals. This represents an important internal
  critique within sympathetic scholarship.

  POSITION: Critical engagement position—argues that the philosophy of
  liberation's European philosophical influences compromise its anti-Eurocentric
  aspirations.

  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/latin-american-philosophy/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gracia provides a comprehensive historical survey of Latin
  American philosophy from pre-Columbian thought through contemporary movements.
  The article situates the philosophy of liberation within broader debates about
  authenticity, originality, and philosophical identity that have characterized
  Latin American philosophy since the mid-20th century. It traces intellectual
  lineages from positivism through culturalism (Zea) to liberation philosophy
  (Dussel, Cerutti-Guldberg).

  RELEVANCE: This encyclopedia entry contextualizes Dussel within the
  institutional and intellectual history of Latin American philosophy, showing
  how his Eurocentrism critique emerged from earlier debates about philosophical
  authenticity (Salazar Bondy) and cultural identity (Zea). The bibliography
  includes key comparative works like Alcoff & Mendieta's volume on Dussel and
  Schutte's work on cultural identity.

  POSITION: Establishes the intellectual-historical context for understanding
  Dussel as part of a tradition concerned with Latin American philosophical
  autonomy while acknowledging European influences.

  figure responsible for spreading the philosophy of liberation outside Latin
  America. It notes his dialogue with European philosophers (Apel, Ricoeur,

@book{AlcoffMendieta2000underside,
  author = {Alcoff, Linda Mart{\'i}n and Mendieta, Eduardo},
  title = {Thinking from the Underside of History: Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield},
  address = {Lanham, MD},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This anthology presents critical analyses of Dussel's
  philosophy of liberation by North American philosophers (Apel, Barber, Lange,
  Marsh, Mignolo, among others) from diverse perspectives including feminist,
  Marxist, and discourse-ethical. The volume includes Dussel's responses to his
  critics. Contributors examine Dussel's engagement with Marx, Levinas, and
  Habermas, his ethics of liberation, and his historical analysis of modernity
  and colonialism.

  RELEVANCE: This volume is the foundational English-language introduction to
  Dussel's work for North American audiences. It situates Dussel comparatively
  within multiple philosophical traditions and includes direct engagement
  between Dussel and his European interlocutors (notably Apel). The contributors
  address whether Dussel's use of Levinas and discourse ethics imports
  Eurocentric elements into liberation philosophy—a central concern for this
  review's investigation of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique.

  POSITION: Presents Dussel as synthesizing Latin American concerns with
  European philosophical frameworks, with contributors debating the success of
  this synthesis.

@book{Barber1998ethical,
  author = {Barber, Michael D.},
  title = {Ethical Hermeneutics: Rationality in Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation},
  year = {1998},
  publisher = {Fordham University Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber interprets Dussel's philosophy of liberation through
  the concept of "ethical hermeneutics," which seeks to interpret reality from
  the viewpoint of the "other" (drawing on Levinas)—those excluded from existing
  socio-political systems. Barber traces Dussel's intellectual development
  toward Levinas's philosophy, showing how Dussel moves beyond Hegelian
  dialectics toward an "analectical" method that affirms the other's
  transcendence. The book emphasizes rationality and ethical obligation in
  Dussel's project.

  RELEVANCE: Barber's study is the most comprehensive English-language treatment
  of Dussel's engagement with Levinas, making it crucial for evaluating whether
  Dussel's use of a European philosopher (Levinas) compromises his critique of
  Eurocentrism. Barber argues that Dussel's appropriation of Levinas serves
  liberation aims, but critics question whether this importation of European
  philosophy undermines Dussel's anti-Eurocentric stance.

  POSITION: Presents Dussel's Levinas engagement as philosophically productive
  for liberation ethics, implicitly defending against charges of Eurocentrism.

@article{Beach2004history,
  author = {Beach, Dennis},
  title = {History and the Other: Dussel's Challenge to Levinas},
  journal = {Philosophy and Social Criticism},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {30},
  number = {3},
  pages = {315--330},
  doi = {10.1177/0191453704041575},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beach argues that Dussel both appropriates and fundamentally
  challenges Levinas by grounding the Other in concrete historical and material
  conditions rather than in transcendental phenomenology. While Levinas presents
  the Other as abstractly transcendent, Dussel identifies the Other with
  specific historically oppressed groups (colonized peoples, the poor). This
  historicization transforms Levinas's ethics into a political philosophy of
  liberation.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies how Dussel's use of Levinas differs from
  straightforward appropriation—Dussel radically recontextualizes Levinas's
  European philosophy within Latin American historical experience. This is
  crucial for evaluating whether Dussel's Levinas engagement represents
  Eurocentrism or a decolonizing transformation of European thought. The debate
  over whether Dussel successfully de-Europeanizes Levinas is central to
  assessing the coherence of Dussel's Eurocentrism critique.

  POSITION: Argues that Dussel transforms rather than merely borrows from
  Levinas, suggesting a non-Eurocentric appropriation is possible.

@article{Chambers2020epistemology,
  author = {Chambers, Paul Anthony},
  title = {Epistemology and Domination: Problems with the Coloniality of Knowledge Thesis in Latin American Decolonial Theory},
  journal = {Dados},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {63},
  number = {4},
  doi = {10.1590/dados.2020.63.4.221},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chambers offers a systematic critique of the "coloniality of
  knowledge" thesis developed by Quijano, Mignolo, Dussel, and Castro-Gómez. He
  argues that decolonial theorists misread Enlightenment epistemology (Descartes,
  Hume), make untenable generalizations about "Western epistemology," and
  ultimately fall into epistemic relativism that undermines both social science
  and decolonial politics. Chambers contends that the coloniality thesis
  conflates political-economic domination with epistemological frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most sustained external critique of the epistemological
  foundations of Dussel's (and related decolonial) work. Chambers challenges
  whether Dussel's reading of European philosophy is accurate and whether
  rejecting "Western epistemology" is coherent or politically productive. His
  critique raises fundamental questions about whether Dussel's Eurocentrism
  critique rests on straw-man characterizations of European thought.

  POSITION: External critical position—argues that decolonial epistemology
  (including Dussel's) is philosophically incoherent and politically
  counterproductive.

  journal = {Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  volume = {100},
  number = {2},
  pages = {221--247},
  doi = {10.1017/s0031819125000087},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This recent paper analyzes the tension between critique and
  alterity in decolonial theory, focusing on Dussel. The authors argue that
  excessive critical thinking can lead to skepticism while excessive emphasis on
  alterity risks dogmatism. They locate decolonial theory (Quijano, Dussel,
  Mignolo) within critical theory traditions while noting its claimed radical
  departure from European thought. The paper defends Dussel's "analectics" as
  balancing critique and alterity, and defends his universalism and rationalism
  against charges by Castro-Gómez and Vallega that Dussel remains Eurocentric.

  RELEVANCE: This very recent article provides an updated assessment of Dussel's
  relationship to European critical theory and addresses ongoing debates about
  whether his work successfully escapes Eurocentrism. The authors' defense of
  Dussel's universalism and rationalism suggests that some degree of engagement
  with European philosophy is necessary for decolonial projects rather than
  evidence of Eurocentrism.

  POSITION: Defends Dussel against charges of Eurocentrism by arguing that his
  relational universalism avoids both Eurocentric totalization and relativist
  fragmentation.

@article{Mendoza2022epistemology,

  journal = {Hypatia},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {37},
  number = {3},
  pages = {510--522},
  doi = {10.1017/hyp.2022.26},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendoza provides a Latin American feminist critique of early
  decolonial theories, particularly Quijano and Dussel. While acknowledging their
  contributions, she argues that decolonial theorists ignore Latin American
  feminist scholarship while citing Chicana feminists, erasing specifically Latin
  American feminist voices. The paper critiques Quijano and Dussel's treatment
  of gender in the coloniality of power thesis, showing how gender analysis
  reveals not only the coloniality of gender but also the coloniality of
  democracy.

  RELEVANCE: This feminist critique reveals an important dimension of
  Eurocentrism in Dussel's work—not his engagement with European philosophy per
  se, but his selective engagement with feminist scholarship that prioritizes
  Northern (U.S. Chicana) over Latin American voices. This represents a form of
  epistemological colonialism within the decolonial project itself, complicating
  Dussel's position as anti-Eurocentric critic.

  POSITION: Internal feminist critique—exposes gendered and geographic
  exclusions within Dussel's decolonial epistemology.

@article{Niblett2021catastrophic,

  volume = {103},
  pages = {113--133},
  doi = {10.3898/newf:103.07.2021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Niblett examines the relationship between economic and cultural
  dependency, framing the analysis through Dussel's methodological insistence on
  international transfer of surplus value as the essence of dependency. The paper
  traces dependency theory's development in the 1960s-1970s and considers how
  cultural analysis (particularly Sylvia Wynter's work) emerged as a crucial site
  for understanding power. Niblett argues that literary works provide barometric
  readings of underdevelopment pressures in advance of political-economic analyses.

  RELEVANCE: This article situates Dussel's philosophy of liberation within the
  broader dependency theory tradition (Frank, Cardoso, Marini), showing how his
  Eurocentrism critique emerged from Latin American political economy rather than
  solely from European philosophy. This contextualization is crucial for
  understanding Dussel's dual intellectual lineage from both dependency theory
  and European ethics.

  POSITION: Establishes dependency theory as a key intellectual source for
  Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism, alongside European philosophical
  engagements.

@book{Schutte1993cultural,
  author = {Schutte, Ofelia},
  title = {Cultural Identity and Social Liberation in Latin American Thought},
  year = {1993},
  publisher = {State University of New York Press},
  address = {Albany, NY},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schutte provides a critical analysis of Latin American
  philosophy's engagement with cultural identity and liberation, including
  extended treatment of the philosophy of liberation movement (Dussel, Roig,
  Cerutti-Guldberg). She critiques the philosophy of liberation for inadequately
  addressing gender and sexuality concerns, arguing that liberation discourse has
  been dominated by masculine perspectives. Schutte situates Dussel within
  debates about cultural authenticity, dependency, and emancipation.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the earliest sustained English-language critiques of
  Dussel's philosophy of liberation from a feminist perspective sympathetic to
  its anti-colonial aims. Schutte's critique that liberation philosophy fails to
  adequately accommodate gender concerns reveals another dimension of exclusion
  in Dussel's work—not Eurocentrism but masculinism. Her work contextualizes
  Dussel within broader Latin American debates about identity and liberation.

  POSITION: Feminist critique of liberation philosophy's gender blindness;
  provides comparative context within Latin American philosophy.

  journal = {},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {},
  pages = {},
  publisher = {},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This volume examines Latino/a experiences and decolonization
  struggles within the framework of world-systems analysis and decolonial theory.
  The authors connect Wallerstein's world-systems theory with the decolonial
  project developed by Dussel, Quijano, and Mignolo, showing how global
  capitalist structures shape racialized hierarchies in the contemporary United
  States. The book bridges dependency theory, world-systems analysis, and
  decolonial epistemology.

  RELEVANCE: This work demonstrates the connections between Dussel's philosophy
  of liberation and world-systems analysis (Wallerstein), showing how his
  Eurocentrism critique draws on structuralist analyses of the global economy.
  The volume reveals how dependency theory and world-systems analysis provided
  the political-economic foundation for Dussel's philosophical critique of
  modernity and coloniality.

  POSITION: Positions Dussel within the world-systems/dependency theory
  tradition, showing economic-structural sources of his Eurocentrism critique.

  title = {Dependency Theory Revisited},
  year = {2019},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315187389},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ghosh provides a comprehensive survey of dependency theory
  from its classical formulations (Prebisch-Singer, Frank, Amin) through
  contemporary revisions. The book examines peripheral writers on dependency
  including Cardoso, Sunkel, Wallerstein, and Myrdal, situating dependency
  theory within broader debates about development, underdevelopment, and unequal
  exchange. Contemporary sections address globalization, technological
  imperialism, and brain drain as new forms of dependency.

  RELEVANCE: While not focused on Dussel specifically, this comprehensive
  overview situates dependency theory—a key intellectual source for Dussel's
  philosophy of liberation—within global development debates. Understanding
  dependency theory's evolution helps clarify how Dussel's Eurocentrism critique
  emerged from Latin American political economy rather than solely from European
  philosophy. The book's treatment of Frank, Wallerstein, and Amin shows the
  intellectual milieu that shaped Dussel's work.

  POSITION: Provides intellectual-historical context for understanding dependency
  theory's influence on Dussel's thought.

  title = {Thinking From the Limits of Being: Levinas, Fanon, Dussel and the Cry of Ethical Revolt},
  year = {2006},
  howpublished = {PhD dissertation, University of California, Berkeley},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Maldonado-Torres examines three thinkers who rethink the human
  in post-imperial ways: Levinas, Fanon, and Dussel. He analyzes how each
  responds to European master morality of domination and control. The dissertation
  evaluates Dussel's appropriation of Levinas through analysis of Fanon, arguing
  that while Dussel should have been more Fanonian than Levinasian at certain
  points, his work contributes importantly to overcoming Western master morality
  of aggression and control.

  RELEVANCE: This dissertation is crucial for understanding Dussel's relationship
  to both European philosophy (Levinas) and African/Caribbean decolonial thought
  (Fanon). Maldonado-Torres suggests that Dussel's Levinas engagement may limit
  his decolonial radicality compared to Fanon's more thoroughgoing critique. This
  comparative framework helps assess whether Dussel's European philosophical
  sources constrain his Eurocentrism critique.

  POSITION: Critical comparative position—suggests Fanon provides more radical
  decolonial resources than Levinas, questioning Dussel's philosophical choices.

  year = {2018},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {},
  doi = {10.5070/T484042045},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Davis argues that globalization is better understood as a
  colonial project than an international process. Drawing on Dussel's
  "transmodernity," Quijano's "global coloniality," and Mendieta's "dialogical
  cosmopolitanism," Davis develops a decolonial definition of globalization that
  foregrounds its violences and colonial continuities. He proposes "affective
  alternatives" as ways of life different from globalization's hegemonic forms,
  creating a parallax that exposes globalization as globalization/coloniality.

  RELEVANCE: This article shows how contemporary decolonial scholars use Dussel's
  concepts (particularly transmodernity) to analyze present-day global power
  structures. It situates Dussel alongside Quijano and Mendieta in developing
  analytical tools for understanding coloniality's persistence. The article
  demonstrates Dussel's influence on current decolonial scholarship and his role
  in connecting historical colonialism to contemporary globalization.

  POSITION: Positions Dussel as foundational for contemporary decolonial analysis

  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.11144/javeriana.cao.32-58.caqed},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Misoczky examines how Quijano's "coloniality of power" and
  Dussel's "transmodernity" provide resources for anti-management perspectives
  that defend life against capitalist domination. She affirms the Philosophy of
  Liberation as an ethical foundation for Latin American studies and argues for
  an "anti-management attitude" that transcends North/South management
  distinctions. The article critically engages postcolonial studies and argues
  for the superiority of decolonial approaches (Quijano, Dussel) for analyzing
  capitalist power's victims.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates how Dussel's work (particularly in
  dialogue with Quijano) informs contemporary critical management and
  organizational studies. It shows Dussel's influence extending beyond philosophy
  into social science applications. The comparison between Dussel and Quijano
  illuminates Dussel's distinctive contributions to decolonial theory—particularly
  his ethical-philosophical framework compared to Quijano's sociological analysis.

  POSITION: Positions Dussel and Quijano as complementary decolonial theorists
  providing ethical and sociological resources for anti-capitalist critique.

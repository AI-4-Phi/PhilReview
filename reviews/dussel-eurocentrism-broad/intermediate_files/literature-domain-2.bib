====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines Dussel's ethics of liberation as a diagnosis of and response to Eurocentrism in moral philosophy. The core debate concerns how Dussel critiques universalist ethics (particularly Kantian and discourse ethics developed by Apel and Habermas) as Eurocentric while simultaneously defending a non-relativist ethics grounded in the material principle of life and the appeals of victims. Key positions include: (1) defenders of Dussel's material ethics as genuinely universal but grounded in exclusion rather than abstract consensus (Zúñiga, Fóscolo), (2) critics who argue that Dussel's ethics remains incompatible with his own formal-procedural criteria (Sørensen, Quintana Paz), and (3) interpreters who emphasize Dussel's appropriation of Levinas's concept of exteriority to diagnose the ethical violence of totality-thinking in European philosophy (Barber, Maldonado-Torres). Recent scholarship highlights the decade-long Dussel-Apel debate over whether material or formal ethics has priority, and whether victims excluded from discourse can ground ethical critique.

The literature reveals Dussel's ethics as fundamentally structured by the concept of "the Other" as exteriority—those excluded from existing systems who appeal from beyond (exterioridad). This concept draws on Levinas but transforms it into a material-historical category: victims of colonialism, poverty, and exclusion. Dussel argues that Habermasian discourse ethics presupposes participants who are already included, thereby rendering invisible those denied access to communication. His material principle—"produce, reproduce, and develop human life"—provides an evaluative standpoint grounded in corporeal vulnerability rather than formal consensus.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain directly addresses how Dussel diagnoses Eurocentrism within ethical theory itself. His critique targets not only the historical biases of European thinkers but the structural exclusions built into supposedly universal ethical frameworks. The debate with Apel and Habermas reveals how Dussel's concept of exteriority functions as an epistemological and ethical critique of center-periphery thinking—victims know what participants in dominant discourse cannot know. This connects to the broader project's investigation of how Dussel's account of Eurocentrism operates across epistemology, ethics, and history.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Limited English-language engagement with Dussel's five-volume Para una ética de la liberación latinoamericana (1973-1980), which contains his early development of the exteriority concept. Few studies compare Dussel's ethics to other postcolonial ethical frameworks (Fanon, Spivak, Mbembe). Minimal treatment of how Dussel's later Political Ethics trilogy (2006-2009) revises or extends the ethics of liberation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesis should emphasize the materialist turn in Dussel's critique of discourse ethics—his argument that formal-procedural ethics presupposes material conditions that exclude victims. The debate with Apel is central but should be framed within Dussel's broader diagnosis of how European ethics operates with an implicit geography (center-periphery). Compare Dussel's concept of "the victim" to Levinas's "the Other" to show both continuity and transformation. Consider whether Dussel's ethics escapes the relativism charge or redefines universality.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Dusselian material ethics: 8 papers - Dussel's material principle of life grounds ethical critique in corporeal vulnerability and exclusion, providing a universal but non-Eurocentric foundation
- Critique of discourse ethics: 6 papers - Dussel's argument that Apel/Habermas presuppose inclusion and cannot account for victims outside the community of communication
- Levinasian exteriority: 4 papers - Dussel's appropriation and transformation of Levinas's concept of the Other as ethical exteriority into a material-historical category
- Critical responses: 4 papers - Arguments that Dussel's ethics contains internal contradictions or fails to escape Eurocentric frameworks

  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel develops a three-tiered ethics of liberation combining material (life-reproduction), formal (validity through discourse), and feasibility (strategic-institutional) criteria. He argues that dominant ethical systems presuppose the exclusion of victims and that ethics must begin from the interpellation of those denied life and recognition. The material principle—obligation to produce, reproduce, and develop human life—provides a universal but non-Eurocentric foundation grounded in corporeal vulnerability rather than abstract reason.

  RELEVANCE: This is the mature statement of Dussel's ethics after his decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel. It directly addresses the charge of Eurocentrism against Kantian and discourse ethics by showing how they presuppose an ideal community of communication that excludes victims of globalization. The concept of "exteriority" (those outside the system) provides Dussel's key diagnostic tool for identifying Eurocentrism in ethical theory—not merely as bias but as structural exclusion.

  POSITION: Defends a material ethics that grounds normativity in the appeals of victims while incorporating discourse-ethical procedures. Argues that material ethics has priority over formal ethics because discourse presupposes participants whose life has already been affirmed.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This collection assesses Dussel's ethics of liberation from multiple critical perspectives, including essays on his debate with Apel over material vs. formal ethics, his engagement with Frankfurt School critical theory, and his concept of transmodernity. Contributors examine whether Dussel's ethics successfully escapes Eurocentrism or replicates modernist assumptions under new terms. The volume includes Dussel's own essay on multiple modernities and an autobiographical reflection on his philosophical trajectory.

  RELEVANCE: Provides critical engagement with Dussel's ethics from sympathetic but probing scholars. Jorge Zúñiga's chapter on grounding the material principle of life addresses the central question of whether Dussel's ethics is relativist or genuinely universal. Amy Allen's essay on ethics and progress examines whether Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism inadvertently relies on Eurocentric categories of development. Essential for understanding contemporary debates over Dussel's ethics.

  POSITION: Critical assessment of liberation ethics from multiple angles, with particular attention to the relationship between Dussel's ethics and Frankfurt School critical theory.

  abstract = {Enrique Dussel is Latin America’s foremost philosopher, renowned for his contributions to ethics, political philosophy, and liberation theology. Designed for classroom use, this collection of essays engages with Dussel’s encyclopedic work, making his valuable contributions accessible to English-speaking students. In addition to being one of the most original, prolific, and widely known members of the Latin American Philosophy of Liberation movement, Dussel has also made important contributions to world philosophy, the history of philosophy, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and the understanding of Karl Marx. Dussel famously engaged in a decade-long debate with Karl-Otto Apel on the relationship between material and formal ethics—that is, between an ethics of the community of life and an ethics of the community of discourse—and he has produced novel interpretations and analyses of the concepts of alterity, exteriority, the other, and the world history of ethical systems. Most recently, Dussel extended his work on an ethics of liberation into a politics of liberation, developed over the course of three published volumes. In this book, scholars from around the world assess Dussel’s work in ways that are both appreciative and critical. Two essays by Dussel bookend the volume: the collection opens with a consideration of the (im)possibility of multiple modernities and ends with an autobiographical trajectory of the philosopher’s thinking. In addition to Dussel and the editors, the contributors to this volume include Linda Martín Alcoff, Don Thomas Deere, Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, Mario Sáenz Rovner, Alejandro A. Vallega, and Jorge Zúñiga M.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mills provides a systematic introduction to the methodology and core concepts of Dussel's ethics of liberation, emphasizing how ethical responsibility emerges from responding to the appeals of victims of the capitalist system. He explains Dussel's three ethical principles (material, formal, feasibility) and how they integrate to form a comprehensive ethics. Mills argues that Dussel's ethics is critical for progressive political and economic theory in the Global North.

  RELEVANCE: The most accessible English-language introduction to Dussel's ethics, designed specifically for readers unfamiliar with liberation philosophy. Mills carefully explains how Dussel's material principle differs from utilitarian welfarism and how his formal principle differs from Habermasian consensus. Useful for understanding how Dussel's ethics responds to the accusation of particularism while critiquing universalist ethics as Eurocentric.

  year = {1998},
  publisher = {Fordham University Press},
  address = {New York},
  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber examines the rationality of Dussel's philosophy of liberation through detailed analysis of Dussel's appropriation of Levinas's ethics and his debates with Apel, Ricoeur, Rorty, and Taylor. He argues that Dussel develops a coherent ethical hermeneutics grounded in the face-to-face encounter with the Other, but transformed from Levinas's transhistorical phenomenology into a material-historical ethics of victims. Barber critically assesses whether Dussel's integration of Levinasian alterity with Marxian materialism succeeds.

  RELEVANCE: The most comprehensive English-language study of Dussel's ethics from the 1970s through the 1990s. Barber's analysis of Dussel's critique of Apel illuminates the stakes of the material-formal debate: whether ethics can begin from excluded victims or must begin from participants in rational discourse. His treatment of Dussel's appropriation of Levinas is essential for understanding how exteriority functions in Dussel's diagnosis of Eurocentrism.

  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Maldonado-Torres situates Dussel's philosophy of liberation within the broader "decolonial turn" in Latin American thought, arguing that Dussel's concept of exteriority (exterioridad) provides a key epistemic and ethical category for theorizing coloniality. He traces how Dussel's ethics emerges from the historical experience of colonization and how the category of "the Other" functions not as abstract alterity but as the colonized subject denied full humanity. Dussel's ethics thus diagnoses Eurocentrism as the philosophical expression of colonial power.

  RELEVANCE: Connects Dussel's ethics to decolonial theory and the modernity/coloniality research program. Shows how Dussel's critique of European ethics is inseparable from his analysis of colonialism—Eurocentric ethics presupposes and legitimates colonial exclusion. Essential for understanding how Dussel's concept of exteriority operates as both epistemological and ethical critique of center-periphery structures.

  POSITION: Positions Dussel as central to decolonial thought and interprets his ethics as fundamentally anticolonial.

  journal = {Philosophy and Social Criticism},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {23},
  number = {3},
  pages = {1--35},
  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dussel articulates the relationship between material ethics (grounded in life-reproduction) and formal moralities (grounded in discourse and validity). He argues that Kantian and discourse ethics are formal but must presuppose material conditions—participants must be alive, fed, capable of communication. Material ethics thus has priority: it establishes the conditions for any formal ethics. Dussel concludes with six principles for formulating a material ethics that is universalizable yet addresses massive poverty and exclusion.

  RELEVANCE: This article presents Dussel's core argument in the debate with Apel. It directly addresses how discourse ethics is Eurocentric by showing that it presupposes an ideal communication community from which victims are excluded. The material principle provides an evaluative standpoint available to those outside the system—victims know that the system denies life. This is Dussel's key move for grounding ethical critique in exteriority.

  POSITION: Defends the priority of material ethics over formal ethics while incorporating procedural validity.

  pages = {15--29},
  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Apel responds to Dussel's critique of discourse ethics, defending the universality of the discourse principle while acknowledging the problem of excluded victims. He argues that discourse ethics provides the only coherent foundation for normative validity and that Dussel's material ethics cannot ground universal norms without smuggling in discourse-ethical assumptions. Apel contends that the problem of global poverty requires extending the discourse community, not abandoning formal ethics.

  RELEVANCE: Apel's direct response to Dussel in the volume dedicated to Dussel's philosophy. This exchange clarifies the stakes of the debate: can ethics begin from victims outside discourse, or must it begin from participants within discourse? Apel's position represents the view that Dussel critiques as Eurocentric—the assumption that ethical validity requires symmetrical communication among participants who are already recognized.

  POSITION: Defense of discourse ethics against Dussel's critique, arguing for the priority of formal-procedural ethics.

  number = {2},
  pages = {84--101},
  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sørensen analyzes Dussel's critique of Apel and Habermas as a form of ideology critique, showing how Dussel argues that discourse ethics functions ideologically by universalizing the perspective of those already included. He examines whether Dussel's material ethics can avoid the same ideological trap—does it universalize the perspective of victims? Sørensen concludes that Dussel's ethics contains unresolved tensions between its materialist and discourse-ethical components.

  RELEVANCE: Provides critical analysis of the Dussel-Apel debate from the perspective of ideology critique. Clarifies how Dussel's concept of Eurocentrism operates in his ethics—not merely as geographical bias but as ideological universalization of the particular standpoint of the center. Sørensen's critique raises important questions about whether Dussel's ethics escapes the problems he identifies in discourse ethics.

  language = {english},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hoston compares Dussel's liberation theology and ethics with Wang Yangming's Neo-Confucian philosophy, identifying parallel epistemological and ethical critiques of orthodoxy. Both Dussel and Wang critique institutionalized orthodoxy for excluding the ethical perspective of the marginalized, and both ground ethics in the primacy of lived experience over abstract doctrine. Hoston argues that Wang's Idealist philosophy contains democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure liberation theology.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates the cross-cultural relevance of Dussel's ethical critiques by comparing them to non-Western philosophical traditions. Shows how Dussel's critique of Eurocentric universalism parallels Wang's critique of Rationalist Neo-Confucian orthodoxy. The comparison illuminates what is distinctive about Dussel's approach: grounding ethics in the appeals of victims and emphasizing Levinasian alterity.

  abstract = {Abstract This article reconsiders the sixteenth-century Idealist Neo-Confucian philosophy of Wang Yangming (1472–1529) in light of the development of twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. After defining liberation theology, this study identifies the crucial contributions made to it by Emmanuel Levinas’s assertion of the primacy of ethics over ontology and critique of the egocentric nature of Western philosophy. It then delineates the epistemological and deontological criticisms made of Roman Catholic orthodoxy—and institutionalized Christianity in general—by Latin American liberation theologians, particularly Enrique Dussel and José Porfirio Miranda. These are compared with Wang’s critique of the Rationalist Neo-Confucianism that had been official orthodoxy and the legitimating philosophy for imperial China for three centuries. The study finds that Wang’s Idealist philosophy incorporates epistemological, spiritual, and ethical perspectives with powerful democratic and liberationist elements that prefigure the development of late-twentieth-century Latin American liberation theology. Thus, contrary to the conventional view of Confucianism as a conservative philosophy, these elements in Wang’s Neo-Confucianism render it a theology (or philosophy) of liberation.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Demenchonok examines debates over grounding human rights in a pluralistic world, analyzing Kantian, discourse-ethical (Apel, Habermas), and liberation-ethical (Dussel) approaches. He argues that while discourse ethics develops Kant's proceduralism, Dussel's ethics of liberation grounds human rights in material dignity and the concrete needs of victims. Demenchonok defends the continuing relevance of Kantian cosmopolitanism while acknowledging Dussel's critique of abstract universalism.

  RELEVANCE: Situates Dussel's ethics within broader debates over human rights and universalism. Shows how Dussel's material principle responds to the problem of grounding rights in culturally diverse contexts—not through abstract reason but through the universality of corporeal vulnerability. Clarifies how Dussel's critique of Kant differs from postmodern relativism.

  abstract = {The paper examines the current debates regarding the grounding of human rights in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. It analyses the challenges which come today from certain policies of human rights which instrumentalize them under the pretext of a “global war on terror” and redefi ne them in terms of democracy promotion and regime change, as well as those challenges which come from ideologies which question the core principles of human rights and provoke the so called “crisis of legitimization.” The paper argues for the necessity of restoring the genuine meaning of human rights and of the role of citizens in striving for their implementation. At the heart of the analysis is Kant’s concept of human rights as freedom. With Kant as its backdrop, the paper shows that the claim that religious worldviews provide the only intelligible foundation, as in Nicholas Wolterstorff, faces serious challenges in a pluralistic, culturally diverse world. The paper then analyzes the non-religious philosophical concepts which seek to develop an account of human rights that does not depend upon controversial metaphysical or religious doctrines. It examines an account of human rights from the perspective of discourse ethics as developed by Karl-Otto Apel and Jurgen Habermas. It also analyses the concepts of human dignity and “emerging morality” by Arturo Roig and the “ethics of liberation” by Enrique Dussel.

  pages = {71--92},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Quintana Paz argues that Dussel's ethics of liberation contains internal contradictions when applied to the question of revolutionary violence. While Dussel endorses three criteria (formal-dialogical, material-welfarist, feasibility-strategic) that any legitimate revolution must satisfy, Quintana Paz contends that each criterion is conceptually incompatible with violence. He concludes that Dussel's arguments involve contradictions when he aims to justify violence with these interdisciplinary criteria.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a key tension in Dussel's ethics: can an ethics grounded in discourse and life-affirmation ever justify revolutionary violence? Quintana Paz argues that Dussel's formal principle (derived from discourse ethics) requires dialogue, which excludes violence. This critique raises questions about whether Dussel's ethics can support the political praxis it aims to ground.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Knauss analyzes Dussel's Ética de la liberación as a critical political-philosophical project that begins from the perspective of excluded persons in former colonies.

Knauss explores whether Dussel successfully moves from critique to normativity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fóscolo examines how Dussel's concept of life and the obligation to conserve and reproduce it function as normative foundation for ethics and political action. She compares Dussel's biopolitics to European concepts of biopower (Foucault, Agamben), arguing that Dussel develops a distinctively Latin American biopolitics grounded in the affirmation of life rather than sovereign power over life. The material principle makes life-reproduction the criterion for evaluating institutions.

  RELEVANCE: Connects Dussel's material ethics to contemporary debates over biopolitics. Shows how Dussel's concept of the material principle differs from utilitarian welfarism—it is not about maximizing preferences but about affirming the conditions for life itself. Demonstrates the relevance of Dussel's ethics for political theory beyond formal-procedural questions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Santasilia argues that philosophy of liberation raises the fundamental question of authentic ethical praxis and liberated life. He contends that liberation is not merely a contingent sociopolitical category but points to the very constitution of subjectivity as intersubjectivity. Liberation modifies the cultural conditions generated by each culture, enabling subjects to recognize themselves as constituted through relationships with others. Subjectivity reveals its fundamental form as intersubjectivity or border subjectivity.

  RELEVANCE: Examines how Dussel's ethics reconceptualizes subjectivity itself, moving from Cartesian ego to intersubjective self constituted through encounter with the Other. This connects to Dussel's Levinasian concept of exteriority—the self is not autonomous but responsive to the appeal of the Other. Shows how Dussel's ethics implies a critique of the subject presupposed by Eurocentric philosophy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume brings together essays by Dussel and his interlocutors (including Karl-Otto Apel), assessing Dussel's critiques of discourse ethics, evaluations of Marx, Levinas, Habermas, and development of a philosophy from the underside of Eurocentric modernity. Contributors examine Dussel's concept of an ethics of the impoverished and his articulation of a Latin American theoretical perspective. The volume includes Dussel's own responses to critics.

  RELEVANCE: Essential collection documenting the Dussel-Apel debate and providing multiple perspectives on Dussel's ethics. Includes Apel's defense of discourse ethics and Dussel's response. Michael Barber's chapter examines Dussel's appropriation of Levinas. The volume as a whole demonstrates the international philosophical reception of Dussel's liberation philosophy and the key debates it has provoked.

  POSITION: Multi-perspective assessment of Dussel's philosophy of liberation with focus on ethics and the Apel debate.

  abstract = {Fichte'sWissenschaftslehreserves an existential as well as a scientific function, and the latter is in the service of the former. So runs a central thesis, and a central theme, of Daniel Breazeale's substantial and long-awaited book on Fichte's early (or 'Jena') philosophical system. That theWissenschaftslehrehas a scientific function is a point that Fichte often trumpets. In one of his preferred formulations, its task is to identify the ground or explanation of the system of representations that are accompanied by a feeling of necessity, and of the feeling of necessity itself. Elsewhere he emphasizes that its task is to identify "die Bestimmung des Menschen" -- the specific determination (or 'vocation') of man. On Breazeale's account, however, these scientific aims are in the service of an existential purpose that is perhaps best described as palliative. TheWissenschaftslehreis Fichte's "means for coming to terms with, and if possible, mitigating, the painful existential division within our own selves" (125).
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That striking formulation of Fichte's ambition was first proposed by Breazeale twenty years ago, in a paper published inFichte-Studien.Fichte-Studien, alas, is not on the shelves of every university library. But this book should be. Breazeale himself is the undisputed dean of Fichte scholarship in the English-speaking world, and among the most important commentators writing on Fichte in any language. Over the past four decades he has not only published scores of papers on Fichte, he has also translated the vast bulk of Fichte's Jena corpus into English, producing a series of masterful critical editions. Both through his own work, and though his influence on the broader scholarly project, he has improved exponentially both the quality and the quantity of primary and secondary material available on Fichte in English. The volume under review comprises fourteen of his papers, all of which were previously published in one form or another. But this is by no means simply a volume of collected essays. Like Fichte himself, Breazeale has not been content to leave his own earlier ideas alone. He has revisited and rethought all of these papers, and the reworking has in most instances led to substantial additions and revisions. The result is a book of great clarity and insight, the mature fruit of long reflection, and one that is really without equivalent in any language.

A memorable passage from the early correspondence provides an instructive glimpse of Fichte's existential project. Writing in the summer of 1795, Fichte was seeking a rapprochement with Jacobi, who would later denounce theWissenschaftslehreas "nihilism." Fichte's letter includes a riff on the Genesis narrative, in a paragraph that concludes with this thought: "Presumption led us to philosophize, and this cost us our innocence. We caught sight of our own nakedness, and since then we have had to philosophize for our salvation." (Breazeale quotes this passage at 137, 263, 379; the mode of composition of the book does result in a certain amount of repetition). So why exactly are we in need of salvation, on Fichte's story, and how could something as obscure and technical as theWissenschaftslehreserve such a function?

Breazeale's answer is framed in terms of "the divided self." Part of the human condition, on this accounting, is to find oneself torn. The division has apsychologicalmanifestation (again and again Breazeale emphasizes the resultingpain), and seems also to have hadbiographicalreality for Fichte himself (drawing on the earliest unpublished "night thoughts," Breazeale argues that Fichte's philosophical work was driven in no small part by personal anguish). But at its root, Breazeale argues, the division is ontological. There is, according to Breazeale's Fichte, "a division at the heart of man's very being as a free, finite agent acting within a spatio-temporal world" (134).

So what is this division, and how can the project of theWissenschaftslehreprovide any kind of help in coping with it? Breazeale characterizes it in a variety of interrelated ways. On one formulation, the division is between "theory and practice," or as Fichte sometimes puts it, between "head and heart." An essential part of human existence is that we both seek knowledge about the world and also act in it. According to Fichte, developing a theme from Kant's antinomies, this dual existence threatens a rupture, specifically with respect to human freedom. From our theoretical perspective, we treat all events, including human actions, as strictly determined; as agents, as Kant's famously puts it, "we act under the idea of freedom." For Fichte, the problem of free will is no mere intellectual puzzle. It puts us at odds with ourselves, with our most developed theoretical reflections threatening to make nonsense of our commitments as agents -- and vice versa. Breazeale: "[Man is] Torn between, on the one hand, the practical certainty of one's own freedom (or moral vocation) and, on the other, the equally undeniable feeling of constraint attendant upon one's empirical awareness of oneself as part and parcel of the natural world-order" (133).

Framed in these terms, one might expect that the "philosophical salvation" about which Fichte writes to Jacobi would take the form of some kind of compatibilism. If your existential suffering derives from the problem of free will, then the philosophy section of your local library is well-stocked with remedies that promise to ease the pain. It is surprising to see how little attention Fichte devotes to this option, particularly since Hume (arguably the grandfather of modern compatibilism) plays such an important role in Fichte's intellectual landscape, as Breazeale shows in his chapters on Aenesidemus (Ch. 2), Maimon (Ch. 3), and skepticism (Ch. 9). Breazeale finds a hint of quasi-rationalist "divine compatibilism" (8) in Fichte's very early book on religion, but the compatibilist theme in Hume's writings seems not to have made any impact on Fichte. Breazeale does at one point describe Fichte's transcendental idealist as "look[ing] for some way to reconcile the experienced passivity of the intellect with the practical certainty of his own freedom or capacity for self-determination" (249). But as we shall see, the reconciliation (such as it is) is highly attenuated, and informed by deeply incompatibilist commitments.

One possible source of those commitments comes into view with a second framing of the existential division: the tug-of-war between autonomy and heteronomy. Sometimes this contrast is framed in Kantian terms as a division between pure moral reason and heteronomous passions. Human nature exhibits "an unstable combination of rationality and sensibility" (345); the result is strife in the human soul. But this familiar and ancient description of the human struggle sits alongside something distinctively modern and idiosyncratically Fichtean. The telltale sign can be found in the particular way in which the drive for autonomy is framed. As Breazeale puts it, the Fichtean I is "predetermined to will independence and self-sufficiencyas the ultimate end of all actingand as the norm for evaluating particular, concrete courses of action" (179, emphasis added). Moreover, the Fichtean conception of self-sufficiency [Selbständigkeit] requires that the I "establish [its] independence and freedom . . .fromany source of external determination" (348, emphasis added).

It is worth pausing to reflect on just how extreme this position really is. The ancient Cynics and Stoics were agreed in placing a very high value on self-sufficiency [αὐτάρκεια], but its value was in large part instrumental. If I am dependent on other things or other people for my happiness, then my happiness is to that extent fragile and vulnerable. Cultivating self-sufficiency is thus a strategy to secure happiness and insure against contingencies that might result in ethical harm. Kant had of course made autonomy a central principle of ethics, but he did not treat autonomy as itself the ultimate end in action. For Kant the ultimate end was thesummum bonum, understood as a combination of happiness and virtue. The Fichtean position on autonomy seems to be much more extreme -- so extreme that it merits a name all its own. Let's call it autono-mania. Autonomy is not simply a value, or an important or central value in human existence; it is the final aim of all action, and requires an absence of determination by anything other than oneself.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This collection of Dussel's essays spans ethics, history, Marxism, and liberation theology, demonstrating the interdisciplinary scope of liberation philosophy. Essays address the relationship between ethics and economics, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, Marxian categories reinterpreted from the perspective of the periphery, and the ethical foundations of liberation theology. Dussel argues that philosophy cannot be separated from historical praxis and that ethics emerges from the lived experience of domination and liberation.

  RELEVANCE: Provides access to key essays showing the development of Dussel's thought and the connections between his ethics, historical analysis, and political economy. Demonstrates how Dussel's critique of Eurocentrism operates across multiple domains—not only in ethics but in historiography and political economy. Essential for understanding the broader context of Dussel's ethics of liberation.

  POSITION: Collection demonstrating the interdisciplinary and praxis-oriented character of Dussel's liberation philosophy.

  abstract = {Among its other virtues, the book boasts an accurate and descriptive title: its purpose is to argue that the dominant trend in Jewish philosophy has run aground because of its reliance on artificially constructed categories like universal/particular, Jew/non-Jew, and Jerusalem/Athens. In that respect, it is an exercise in what Aaron Hughes calls "Jewish metaphilosophy." He takes issue with the rationalist tendencies that emerged from the nineteenth century movement known asWissenschaft des Judentumsas well as the particularist tendencies that one finds in the work of Franz Rosenzweig. Whatever one thinks of the substance of Hughes' arguments, there is no getting around the fact that he writes with flare and knows his sources extremely well. I am not aware of any recent book in the field of Jewish philosophy that presents as serious a challenge to those who practice it as this one.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Before getting to substance, let me offer something by way of introduction. The field of Jewish philosophy has always suffered from a lack of consensus on how to define it. If one were to teach a course on comparative religion in a modern university, one would likely include Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism. By the same token, if one were to list the nationalities that have played an important role in Western culture since 1492, one would likely include the French, Dutch, Germans, British, Spanish, Italians, Irish, Poles, and Jews. Note that Jews are the only group that gets mentioned twice. This has led to a long-standing question: Is Judaism primarily a religion defined by practice and belief or a nationality defined by group identity? How one answers this question will determine how one understands the discipline of Jewish philosophy.

No one questions that Maimonides, Mendelssohn, Cohen, Rosenzweig, Buber, and Levinas belong to this discipline. But what does one do with Philo, whose influence was mainly on early Christianity, Spinoza, who was excommunicated, Bergson, Husserl, or Wittgenstein? Even apart from Judaism, the problem of defining philosophy in terms of nationality has always been problematic. No one would bat an eye if one were to say that Aristotle is a central figure in Islamic philosophy, Frege in Anglo-American philosophy, or Husserl in French philosophy.

The result is that anyone who works in the field of Jewish philosophy has to cut Hughes a fair amount of slack. The categories that we use to describe the discipline are artificial to a great extent and reflect current academic or ideological biases. But Judaism is not the only culprit. In the 1980's, Richard Rorty argued that there is no identifiable method or body of results that would allow one to categorize such diverse thinkers as Parmenides, Aristotle, Descartes, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Russell, and Derrida as philosophers. To go a step further, if we were to look closely at the categories we use to teach the history of philosophy, e.g.,Neo-Platonist,rationalist,empiricist,existentialist, we might conclude that they are useful ways of organizing complicated material and teaching people how to think about it. But if we were to look at them closely with the eyes of a specialist, we would see that the boundaries of these categories are porous and that searching for an essence that all figures share is mainly a waste of time.

As Hughes shows in detail, take something as ill-defined asJudaism, put it together with something as ill-defined asphilosophy, and you are asking for trouble. You are asking for even more trouble if you think of Judaism as representing the particular and philosophy as representing the universal. In Hughes' words: "At the heart of Jewish philosophy is fracture and dislocation. . . . As philosophy, this activity makes claims to universal validity, but as an activity by a specific group of people, it must of necessity be inherently particularistic" (p. 1). In a manner reminiscent of Hegel and championed by Derrida, Hughes proceeds to show that dichotomies like universal/particular play off against each other and serve to destabilize each other. Instead, he proposes: "a Derridean-inspired reading of these two terms, one that argues that meaning does not arise out of fixed differences, but is produced and performed in ways that are always partial and provisional throughdifférance, in which differential meanings are endlessly deferred" (p. 2).

To be more specific, the problem with Jewish philosophy is that to overcome the impossibility of the task it sets for itself, it has to provide a picture of what "authentic" Judaism amounts to. In Hughes' opinion, this often leads to the claim that the philosopher has uncovered Judaism in its pristine, timeless, or original form. There are two problems with such an approach. First, the idea of a pristine form of Judaism unencumbered by modern or outside influences is a construction (read: fantasy) at odds with what the historical record shows to be the case. A good example of this tendency is Maimonides' contention that the patriarchs and Moses discovered physics and metaphysics before the Greeks but that due to centuries of political oppression, the records of their accomplishments have been lost. Second, once someone claims to have shown the way to authentic Judaism, it is difficult not to marginalize or even ignore everything deemed to be inauthentic. Turning to Maimonides once again, anyone who believes that God is material or even that God has multiple attributes does not count as Jewish. If this were to be enforced rigorously, it would mean that in any age, the majority of Jews would have to be read out of the faith. This is all a way of saying that the search for authenticity culminates in fantasy or dogmatism, often both.

Another of Hughes' complaints is the degree to which Jewish philosophy sees its task as apologetic. To defend Judaism against its nineteenth century critics, theWissenschaftmovement tried to show that it was just as rational and therefore just as worthy of being taught in the academy as the Christianity seen through the lens of Kant or Hegel. To accomplish this, they had to ignore the mystical tradition or regard it as an embarrassment that distorted the true meaning of the religion. Again from Hughes:

Jewish philosophy and also its academic study thus potentially make the tradition into something that it is not. In the desire to make the tradition conform to a standard of rationality it has created in its own image, Jewish philosophy creates a highly selective narrative that risks distortion or, at the very least, betrays a certain privileging.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Barber reviews Dussel's 1996 book examining his engagement with Apel, Ricoeur, Rorty, and Taylor. He highlights how Dussel critiques these philosophers from the perspective of the excluded and impoverished, arguing that their theories presuppose the standpoint of the center and cannot account for the experience of periphery. Barber emphasizes Dussel's argument that philosophy must begin from the underside of history to avoid reproducing Eurocentric assumptions.

  RELEVANCE: Brief but important review situating Dussel's critique of European and North American philosophy. Shows how Dussel's concept of thinking from the underside functions as both methodological and ethical principle—philosophy must begin from the perspective of victims to avoid ideological universalization of the particular.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Rodríguez Reyes examines the possibility of intercultural dialogue between Dussel's ethics of liberation and Apelian/Habermasian discourse ethics. He argues that despite fundamental disagreements, both approaches share commitment to rational justification and the critique of domination. The essay explores whether a synthesis is possible that preserves Dussel's emphasis on material conditions and victims while incorporating discourse-ethical procedures.

  RELEVANCE: Recent contribution to the Dussel-Apel debate, suggesting possibilities for reconciliation or synthesis. Shows that the debate continues into the 2020s and that scholars are exploring whether the material-formal divide can be bridged. Relevant for assessing whether Dussel's critique of discourse ethics is final or whether intercultural dialogue can transform both approaches.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zúñiga examines how Dussel grounds the material principle of life, arguing that it is neither derived from discourse ethics nor reducible to biological survival. The material principle is normative because human life is inherently vulnerable and interdependent—to deny life is to contradict the conditions for any ethical discourse. Zúñiga defends Dussel's material ethics against the charge of relativism, showing how it provides a universal but non-Eurocentric foundation.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the key philosophical question of how Dussel's material principle is grounded. This is crucial for assessing whether Dussel's ethics escapes Eurocentrism without falling into relativism. Zúñiga's argument that the material principle is universal because corporeal vulnerability is universal provides Dussel's response to critics who claim his ethics is merely regional or particularist.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors employ Dussel's Ethics of Liberation as framework for decolonial critique of Eurocentric criminological knowledge. They argue that punitive power in peripheral countries has been shaped by the colonial matrix of domination, and that critical criminology must be decolonized using Dussel's material criterion of life. The Ethics of Liberation contributes to reconfiguring punitive power in favor of vulnerable groups to reduce their victimization, but without creating new victims of exclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates application of Dussel's ethics beyond abstract moral philosophy to concrete questions of criminal justice. Shows how Dussel's material criterion provides evaluative standpoint for critiquing institutions in peripheral countries. The emphasis on avoiding new victims reflects Dussel's formal-procedural principle—liberation must not reproduce domination.

Therefore, we explored decolonial knowledge, correlating it with critical criminology, resulting in the proposal of a decolonial criminology. The theoretical contributions, in conjunction with the Ethics of Liberation, were employed to foster a critical awareness of the use of punitive power as a means of maintaining the colonial matrix of domination and exploitation, especially within the field of criminology. In conclusion, we also presented the contribution of the Ethics of Liberation to a new configuration of punitive power, now employed in favor of vulnerable groups with the aim of eliminating or reducing their victimization within the current world system.

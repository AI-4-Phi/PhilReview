DOMAIN 1: Housing Affordability and Cost Burden Economics
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-13
PAPERS_FOUND: 15
GEOGRAPHIC_FOCUS: Germany (primary), Europe (secondary)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Google Scholar, DIW Berlin, OECD, Eurostat, IMF, academic journals
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses core economic research on housing cost burdens, housing affordability
metrics, and rent-to-income ratios in Germany and Europe. Research focuses on measurement
approaches (ratio vs. residual income), burden distribution across income quintiles, trends
over time (particularly 1993-2024), and the relationship between housing expenditure and
income inequality. Key data sources include German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), EU-SILC,
EVS (Income and Consumption Survey), and administrative data. Major findings show that
housing expenditure dramatically amplifies income inequality trends, with burden rising
disproportionately for bottom income quintile while falling for top quintile. Germany shows
higher overburden rates (12.0%) than EU average (8.2%).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Provides baseline empirical evidence on housing burden patterns in Germany, essential for
testing Hypotheses 1, 2, and 4. Documents the income gradient in housing burden and provides
quantified evidence of how burden varies across income distribution.

KEY_DEBATES:
- Ratio approach (30/40% thresholds) vs. residual income approach
- Subjective vs. objective burden measurement
- Before-housing vs. after-housing income inequality
- Role of housing tenure (owner vs. renter) in burden distribution

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 1993-2013. Data source: German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe (EVS). Control variables: Age, household structure, region, time trends. Main findings: Housing expenditure changes substantially amplify income inequality trends. While the 50/10 income ratio increased by 22 percentage points between 1993-2013, it rose 62 percentage points when accounting for housing costs. The income share of housing expenditure rose disproportionally for the bottom income quintile and fell for the top quintile. Around 70% of individuals in the lowest income quintile are renters, while in the top quintile only about one-third are renters. Younger cohorts spend more on housing and save less than older cohorts did at the same age. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (high burdens for low-income city dwellers), H4 (changes in income explain housing burden variation).}

  note = {Geography: Germany. Time period: 2000s. Data source: SOEP. Control variables: Income, household size, dwelling characteristics, energy consumption. Main findings: Germany's housing allowance program (Wohngeld) covers both housing and heating expenses for low-income households. Residents in low-cost units typically occupy flats with poor thermal performance, potentially driving up energy consumption, but this counteracting effect is of negligible magnitude. From an ecological perspective, the allowance scheme creates distorted incentives. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (low-income household burdens), H6 (policy operationalization).}

Control variables: Income, age, household structure, policy parameters (transfer taxes, mortgage interest deductibility, social housing availability). Main findings: Three policy factors suppress German homeownership: (1) extensive social housing sector with broad eligibility criteria, (2) high transfer taxes when buying real estate (average 5-6%), (3) no tax deductions for mortgage interest payments. Adjusting all three policies would close the gap in homeownership rates between Germany and the U.S. by about two-thirds. Only 22% of German households in the bottom income quintile are homeowners compared to 45% overall. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (low-income housing access), H6 (institutional/policy context).}

Households with medium income spend around 24% of net income on rent when signing new tenancy agreements, and in metropolitan areas almost a third. Net rents in major German cities (A-cities) are 70% more expensive than 13 years ago (2011-2024). High rental price dynamics since 2021 are increasingly burdening low-income households.

Main findings: Position of market renters deteriorated relative to mortgaged homeowners during 2010-2018 in terms of both housing cost burdens and low incomes. In absence of intergenerational transfers, many are compelled into private rental market where rent burdens continue to grow. Germany is one of just five countries where fewer than half of low-income tenants in private market are overburdened when total housing costs are taken into account. Relevance to hypotheses: H2 (high burdens for renters, especially low-income), H5 (housing market dualization).}

  note = {Geography: United States (but widely applied including in Europe). Time period: Conceptual paper with empirical applications. Data source: Various housing surveys. Main findings: Proposes residual income approach to measuring housing affordability rather than ratio approach. Residual income approach measures cost burden by calculating money family has left for housing after other expenditures (food, clothing, medical costs, school fees). In sample of 30.9 million renter households, 19.2 million (62.1%) were cost-burdened by residual-income measure while 14.8 million (47.9%) by traditional 30% measure. Residual-income approach provides better sense of how cost burdens vary across household types and incomes.

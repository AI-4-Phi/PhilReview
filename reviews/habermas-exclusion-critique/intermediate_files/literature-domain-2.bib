DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The feminist critique of Habermas's public sphere theory constitutes one of the most sustained and philosophically consequential bodies of literature engaging his work. The central challenge, developed across historical, normative, and social-theoretical registers, is that the bourgeois public sphere Habermas idealizes in "The Structural Transformation" (1962) was constitutively exclusionary: it was built on the privatization of women, racialized others, and the working class, while projecting a fiction of universal access. Joan Landes's historical work (1988) demonstrated that the republican public sphere in revolutionary France was actively gendered masculine, with women's exclusion integral rather than incidental to its formation. Nancy Fraser's "Rethinking the Public Sphere" (1990) became the pivotal critical synthesis, developing four interlocking objections: Habermas brackets social inequalities among deliberating parties; he insists on a single unified public where multiple publics better serve contestation; he excludes private matters from public deliberation; and he ignores non-liberal, non-bourgeois counter-publics. Fraser's alternative concept of "subaltern counterpublics" --- arenas where subordinated groups reformulate their identities and needs --- became the dominant feminist reconstruction of the public sphere.

Seyla Benhabib and Iris Marion Young represent the two main reconstructive feminist trajectories within the Habermasian tradition. Benhabib developed "interactive universalism" as a feminist revision of discourse ethics, critiquing Habermas's universalist moral framework for its reliance on an abstracted "generalized other" that occludes the "concrete other" with particular identities and relationships. Young's critical project attacked deliberative democracy from a different angle: she argued that the ideals of impartiality and rational argument themselves suppress difference, functioning as a hegemonic norm that excludes affective, rhetorical, and narrative modes of political communication associated with marginalized groups. The edited collection by Johanna Meehan (1995) assembled these and related feminist engagements systematically, including work by Carol Gould, Lois McNay, Jodi Dean, and others.

Recent scholarship has extended these debates in several directions: the interface of epistemic justice with deliberative democracy (Dieleman 2015), the reconstruction of the public sphere through feminist care ethics (Kavada 2024), and critical assessments of how far Habermas's own revisions in "Between Facts and Norms" (1992) addressed feminist objections. The Aubert (2020) review is notable for taking seriously Habermas's own resources for responding to inclusion critiques, while Pajnik (2006) and Fiig (2011) offer more critical assessments from feminist standpoints.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Feminist critiques are foundational to any account of the exclusionary structure of Habermas's public sphere and communicative action theory. They demonstrate that the supposedly neutral procedures of deliberation (bracketing inequalities, setting aside personal interests, prioritizing rational argument) systematically disadvantage participants whose social position deviates from the unmarked bourgeois male subject. This critique directly parallels Dussel's transmodern/decolonial argument that the "ideal speech situation" and the bourgeois public sphere exclude the colonial Other and the world-system's underside, mapping feminist exclusion onto racial, colonial, and class exclusion within a common structural framework.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The direct intersection of feminist and decolonial critiques of Habermas has not yet produced a sustained joint framework; most feminist and postcolonial critiques proceed in parallel rather than in dialogue. The reception of Habermas's "A New Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere" (2022) from feminist perspectives is still sparse in academic literature.

These are retained in the file but excluded from synthesis per conventions; annotations in the note fields are based on direct engagement with the texts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Feminist critiques should be paired with race-critical and decolonial critiques to demonstrate the convergent structure of exclusion across multiple axes. Fraser's counter-publics framework is especially useful as a bridge concept, since it is explicitly invoked in discussions of decolonial and indigenous public spheres.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Historical exclusion thesis: [3 papers] --- Landes, Fraser, McNay: the bourgeois public sphere was structurally gendered and the public/private distinction operated ideologically to naturalize women's exclusion.
- Reconstructive/normative feminist response: [5 papers] --- Benhabib (interactive universalism), Young (communicative democracy), Meehan (ed.), Dean (solidarity), Dieleman (epistemic justice): retaining communicative insights while correcting exclusions.
- Counter-public and subaltern spheres: [4 papers] --- Fraser (subaltern counterpublics), Aubert (inclusion challenge), Fiig (feminist citizenship), Kavada (care): alternative models of democratic publics.
- Critique of impartiality and deliberative norms: [3 papers] --- Young (impartiality), Pajnik (feminist reflections), Mansbridge (long life of Fraser): the procedures of deliberation themselves are sites of exclusion.

  pages = {56--80},
  doi = {10.2307/466240},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fraser argues that Habermas's idealization of the bourgeois public sphere is flawed on four counts: it brackets structural inequalities among participants rather than neutralizing them; it presupposes a single unified public space where multiple competing publics would better serve democracy; it restricts deliberation to matters of common concern while privatizing contestable issues; and it ignores non-liberal, non-bourgeois counter-publics, including working-class, feminist, and black counter-publics. The central positive contribution is the concept of "subaltern counterpublics" --- parallel discursive arenas where subordinated groups invent and circulate counter-discourses that both contest dominant interpretations and prefigure alternative social arrangements.

  RELEVANCE: This article is the most cited feminist critique of Habermas's public sphere and directly addresses how stratified societies produce exclusionary publics. Its counter-publics concept is directly applicable to understanding how colonial and racialized groups similarly form alternative spheres; the parallel to Dussel's decolonial critique is structural. Fraser's insistence that the liberal public sphere's universalism masked particularist class and gender interests parallels the decolonial critique that its universalism masked Eurocentrism.

  POSITION: Foundational critique of liberal public sphere idealization from a feminist and critical-theory perspective.

  year = {1992},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9781003059516},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Benhabib develops "interactive universalism" as a feminist revision of Habermasian discourse ethics. Against the universalist moral framework's tendency to posit an abstract "generalized other" stripped of particularity, Benhabib insists on preserving the standpoint of the "concrete other" --- the particular individual with specific history, identity, and affective constitution. She argues that Habermas's discourse ethics can be reconstructed to incorporate the relational, narrative, and context-sensitive dimensions that feminist ethics has foregrounded, while retaining the procedural commitment to impartial justification through dialogue. The book also engages Young's critique of impartiality and debates with Fraser and Butler about feminist postmodernism.

  RELEVANCE: This book represents the most sustained attempt to reconstruct Habermasian communicative ethics from within a feminist perspective, making it essential for understanding both the feminist critique of Habermas and the range of feminist responses that preserve communicative insights. Its argument about the abstracted "generalized other" as a site of exclusion is directly applicable to the decolonial critique: the colonial Other is similarly abstracted away in Habermas's ideal speech situation.

  POSITION: Feminist reconstructivist position within Habermasianism, advocating interactive universalism.

  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/0198297556.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Young systematically challenges the deliberative democracy model associated with Habermas and Rawls on grounds that its privileged norms of rational argumentation, impartiality, and orderly discourse silently exclude or disadvantage groups whose communicative styles differ from those of dominant groups. Young proposes "communicative democracy" as an alternative, which legitimizes greeting, rhetoric, and narrative alongside formal argument as valid modes of political communication. She argues that structural social differences require mechanisms of group representation to ensure genuine inclusion rather than formal equality, and develops a politics of difference that contests the civic republican ideal of a homogeneous public.

  RELEVANCE: Young's critique is central to demonstrating that the very procedures of deliberation are sites of exclusion, not merely the content of who is invited to participate. This structural critique of deliberative norms extends naturally to the exclusion of colonized peoples and non-Western speakers whose communicative forms are devalued in the Habermasian public sphere. Her defense of group representation and attention to structural disadvantage provides a framework applicable to understanding decolonial demands for epistemic reparation.

  POSITION: Radical democratic feminist critique of deliberative democracy, advocating communicative democracy.

  abstract = {Abstract Theorists of deliberative democracy have not sufficiently attended to the ways that processes of debate and decision making often marginalize individuals and groups not only because of their lesser social and economic power but also because the norms of political discussion are biased against some forms of expression. Democratic theory should include forms of acknowledgement, narrative, rhetoric, and public protest, along with argument, in its account of the normative ideals of political communication. Inclusive democracy involves more than the formal equality of all individuals and groups to enter the political process, but entails taking special measures to compensate for the social and economic inequalities of unjust social structures. Such special measures may require forms of group representation, in order that the particular social perspective of group members gains voice. Residential segregation poses particular problems for inclusive democracy in many societies. Organizing metropolitan governance systems with diverse representation may respond to such problems. In a globalized world, finally, the project of inclusive democracy involves criticizing adherence to nation-state sovereignty and creating global level democratic institutions.},

@book{landes1988women,
  author = {Landes, Joan B.},
  title = {Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution},
  year = {1988},
  publisher = {Cornell University Press},
  address = {Ithaca, NY},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Landes argues, through a historical study of the French Revolution and its public sphere, that the bourgeois republican public sphere was not merely accidentally exclusive of women but was constitutively defined against femininity. The gendered exclusion of women was not a residual feature to be corrected by extending the universalist ideal; rather, the ideal of rational public discourse was actively constituted through the repudiation of aristocratic femininity and the domestication of bourgeois femininity. Habermas's historical account idealizes a sphere whose very formation depended on the exclusion of women and their relegation to a domesticated private sphere.

  RELEVANCE: This is the key historical study grounding the feminist critique of Habermas's public sphere theory in concrete historical analysis rather than abstract normative argument. It demonstrates that the public/private distinction Habermas takes as a formal procedural achievement is in fact a gendered ideological construction. This historical argument directly parallels the decolonial critique that the bourgeois public sphere was simultaneously defined against colonial subjects.

@book{meehan1995feminists,
  author = {Meehan, Johanna},
  title = {Feminists Read {Habermas}: Gendering the Subject of Discourse},
  year = {1995},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume brings together feminist philosophers engaging Habermas's discourse theory from multiple angles. Contributors address his moral theory, theory of communicative action, and public sphere concept, ranging from sympathetic reconstruction to fundamental critique. Key chapters explore: whether Habermas's proceduralism can accommodate feminist concerns about power, norms, and subjectivity (Benhabib); the ways discourse ethics fails to account for asymmetric power relations in communication (Fraser); the gendered structure of the lifeworld (Gould); and the limits of communicative approaches to feminist politics (McNay, Dean). The volume documents the debate between feminist reformers and feminist critics of Habermas across the range of his theoretical projects.

  RELEVANCE: This anthology provides the most systematic mapping of feminist engagements with Habermas and is an indispensable reference for understanding the range and depth of feminist critiques. Its chapters directly address both the feminist critique of the public sphere and the question of whether Habermasian communicative theory can be reconstructed. The volume's critical breadth provides context for situating Dussel's decolonial critique within a broader landscape of exclusion critiques.

  POSITION: Edited volume representing the full spectrum of feminist responses to Habermas.

  volume = {99},
  number = {2},
  pages = {250--274},
  doi = {10.1086/293065},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Young challenges the liberal republican ideal of universal citizenship as a standpoint of impartiality that transcends particular group affiliations. She argues that this ideal of undifferentiated citizenship systematically disadvantages groups who differ from the unmarked norm (white, male, bourgeois, heterosexual), since the suppression of group difference in public deliberation merely consolidates the dominant group's hegemony under a universal guise. Young proposes instead a differentiated citizenship that recognizes group-specific rights and representation as conditions of genuine political inclusion, particularly for oppressed groups.

  RELEVANCE: This article develops the theoretical foundation for Young's later work on communicative democracy and directly addresses the exclusionary structure of deliberative ideals, showing how the formal universalism of the Habermasian public sphere functions to exclude those who deviate from the dominant norm. The argument is directly applicable to understanding how colonial subjects, indigenous peoples, and racialized groups are excluded not merely empirically but structurally through the norms of deliberation itself.

  POSITION: Feminist critique of universal citizenship, advocating differentiated group representation.

  year = {2006},
  volume = {9},
  number = {3},
  pages = {385--404},
  doi = {10.1177/1368431006065719},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pajnik argues that Habermas's theory of communicative action, despite its emancipatory aspirations, remains inadequate for feminist political theory because it privileges a particular model of rationality and public discourse that excludes affective, embodied, and care-oriented modes of communication. She examines how the gender-blindness of the theory's formal pragmatics and its procedural model of discourse fails to account for the gendered structures of the lifeworld and the systemic exclusion of women from the public sphere's defining practices.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides a focused philosophical examination of the communicative action framework's feminist limitations, engaging both the early theory of communicative rationality and the later political theory. It articulates the gap between Habermas's formal universalism and the embodied, relational dimensions of communication in a way that directly parallels postcolonial critiques of the theory's Western rationalism.

  POSITION: Feminist critique of communicative rationality, arguing for a more inclusive political theory.

Numerous articles considering communicative action as developed by Habermas from a feminist perspective have been published, but no systematic analysis of these arguments exists. This article aims to fill the gap by providing an examination of various readings of communicative action from a feminist standpoint. If, on one hand, the article collects the dispersed feminist critique of communicative action and offers insight into feminist argumentation, its aim is, on the other hand, to reflect the critique itself. Therefore, attention is devoted both to feminist readings of communicative action, as well as to the potential shortcomings of these readings that are detected by a closer examination of Habermas's own works. The article's aim is also to show how feminist critics, in their interpretations and reformulations of communicative action, focus on an explication of the inclusive elements of communicative action.},

  number = {4},
  pages = {448--466},
  doi = {10.1177/1368431020983781},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aubert examines the challenge that social inclusion poses for Habermas's theory of deliberative democracy, surveying critiques from Negt and Kluge, Fraser, Honneth, and Young. She argues that Habermas's account of the political public sphere contains internal resources for responding to these critiques --- particularly his treatment of the gap between religious and post-metaphysical worldviews and his concept of communicative power --- that his critics have underestimated. The article offers a partial defense of Habermas while acknowledging the force of Fraser's and Young's critiques regarding the paradoxically excluding effects of impartiality norms.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides the most systematic recent survey of inclusion critiques of Habermasian deliberative democracy and assesses the extent to which his framework can respond to feminist, Marxist, and recognition-based critiques. It is useful for mapping the overall landscape of exclusion critiques and for identifying what remains contested or underdeveloped in Habermas's own responses.

After recalling Habermas's views on the public sphere, I present and discuss various objections raised by other critical theorists: Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nancy Fraser, Axel Honneth and Iris Marion Young. These criticisms insist on the paradoxically excluding effects of a conception of democracy that promotes civic participation in the public debate. Negt, Kluge and Fraser develop a Marxist line of analysis that question who can participate in the public sphere. Honneth and Young criticize in various ways the excluding effect of argumentation: are unargumentative speeches excluded from the public debate? I show how Habermas's model can provide some responses to these various objections by drawing inspiration from his treatment of the gap between religious and post-metaphysical world views.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mansbridge assesses the intellectual legacy of Fraser's "Rethinking the Public Sphere" (1990) over its first twenty-five years, tracing how its core concepts --- particularly subaltern counterpublics --- have been taken up, extended, and contested across feminist theory, political science, and communication studies. She examines the article's impact on theorizing multiple publics, on democratic theory's engagement with inequality, and on feminist politics, while noting ongoing debates about the normative status of counterpublics and the conditions of their democratic legitimacy.

  RELEVANCE: This chapter provides important secondary perspective on Fraser's foundational contribution and maps the reception history of the counter-publics framework. It situates Fraser's work within the broader trajectory of feminist political theory's engagement with Habermas and identifies the most productive ongoing extensions of her framework, which includes work relevant to decolonial and postcolonial counter-publics.

  number = {6},
  pages = {1--20},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276403206001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McNay argues that there is a fundamental tension between feminist uses of narrative identity --- which emphasize the particularity, contingency, and embodied character of selfhood --- and the proceduralist communicative ethics derived from Habermas. While Benhabib's interactive universalism attempts to bridge these frameworks by incorporating the concrete other into discourse ethics, McNay contends that this synthesis is ultimately unstable: the narrative dimensions of identity resist the abstraction required by communicative procedures, and the disembodied rationalism of discourse ethics cannot fully accommodate feminist insights about the social constitution of the self.

  RELEVANCE: This article engages a fundamental tension in feminist reconstructions of Habermas: can the embodied, narrative, relational self that feminist theory valorizes be accommodated within the communicative framework's proceduralist universalism? This tension is directly relevant to the decolonial critique of Habermas, since colonial subjects are similarly defined by particular histories, relationships, and embodied experiences that the ideal speech situation abstracts away.

  POSITION: Critical feminist assessment of the Benhabib-Habermas synthesis, arguing narrative identity and communicative ethics are incompatible.

The concept of narrative is seen as a way of bridging the gap between the formalism of Habermas's idea of communicative ethics and the dispersion that arises from the post-structural critique of the subject. The idea of the narrative self undoubtedly yields an active and creative account of agency. However, I argue that the attempt to reconcile a narrative concept of the self within a theory of communicative ethics results in a limited understanding of identity and agency in the context of the systemic reproduction of gender inequalities.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Benhabib critiques Habermas's and Kohlberg's moral frameworks for privileging the standpoint of the "generalized other" --- an abstract, disembodied rational being with no particular history or relationships --- at the expense of the "concrete other," who has specific identities, needs, and emotional attachments. This suppression of the concrete other, Benhabib argues, is both philosophically distorting and politically exclusionary, systematically relegating the care relations, emotional labor, and relational dimensions of morality to the private sphere where they remain invisible to public moral-political discourse. The essay draws on Gilligan's "different voice" to challenge Habermasian moral universalism while retaining a procedural commitment to justification.

  RELEVANCE: This essay provides the core philosophical grounding for feminist objections to Habermasian universalism: the abstraction of the "generalized other" is the mechanism through which gender (and by extension, other markers of particularity) is excluded from moral-political deliberation. This argument is central to understanding how Habermas's ideal speech situation structurally excludes any Other defined by particular rather than universal characteristics --- whether that Other is gendered, racialized, or colonized.

  doi = {10.1111/hypa.12173},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dieleman brings Miranda Fricker's theory of epistemic justice to bear on deliberative democratic theory, arguing that Habermasian deliberative democracy is inadequate because it fails to address testimonial and hermeneutical injustice as structural conditions that undermine the epistemic quality of deliberation. Deliberative theories that merely require formal inclusion do not address the ways marginalized speakers are systematically discredited (testimonial injustice) or lack the conceptual resources to articulate their experiences (hermeneutical injustice). Dieleman argues that epistemic justice is a condition of democratic legitimacy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a contemporary philosophical framework --- epistemic justice --- that connects feminist critique of deliberative democracy to broader questions of knowledge production and credibility. It is directly relevant to understanding how colonized peoples and other marginalized groups experience not merely exclusion from deliberation but epistemic marginalization within it. The concept of hermeneutical injustice --- lacking interpretive frameworks to articulate one's experience --- is particularly relevant to decolonial critique.

However, feminist theorists have criticized prominent accounts of deliberative democracy, and of the public sphere that is its site, for being too exclusionary. Iris Marion Young, Nancy Fraser, and Seyla Benhabib show that deliberative democrats generally fail to attend to substantive inclusion in their conceptions of deliberative space, even though they endorse formal inclusion. If we take these criticisms seriously, we are tasked with articulating a substantively inclusive account of deliberation. I argue in this article that enriching existing theories of deliberative democracy with Fricker's conception of epistemic in/justice yields two specific benefits. First, it enables us to detect instances of epistemic injustice, and therefore failures of inclusion, within deliberative spaces. Second, it can act as a model for constructing deliberative spaces that are more inclusive and therefore better able to ground democratic legitimacy.},

  title = {Solidarity of Strangers: Feminism After Identity Politics},
  year = {1996},
  publisher = {University of California Press},
  address = {Berkeley, CA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dean argues that feminist politics requires a theory of solidarity that moves beyond both the politics of identity and the Habermasian model of communicative rationality. Against identity politics, she argues that feminist solidarity cannot be grounded in a shared essence or common experience; against Habermas, she argues that the abstract ideal of communicative reason fails to account for the concrete historical conditions of women's exclusion from public discourse. Dean draws on postmodern feminism and reflective solidarity to propose a model of feminist political community grounded in shared commitment to transformative political struggle rather than shared identity.

  RELEVANCE: Dean's critique engages both the feminist politics of identity and the Habermasian public sphere simultaneously, making it relevant to understanding the limits of communicative models of politics for feminist and other marginalized groups. Her critique of the abstract universalism of communicative reason parallels the decolonial critique that Habermas's universalism abstracts from the concrete historical conditions of colonial domination.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fiig rethinks the Habermasian public sphere from a feminist theory and citizenship perspective, examining the extent to which the concepts of opinion formation and will formation in Habermas's political theory can accommodate feminist demands for inclusion and gendered representation. She draws on Nordic feminist theories of citizenship and Young's communicative democracy to argue that the Habermasian model requires substantial reconstruction to account for gender as a structural axis of political exclusion, particularly regarding who has effective access to opinion-forming publics and whose interests are systematically excluded.

  RELEVANCE: This article directly addresses the interface of feminist citizenship theory with Habermasian public sphere theory, providing an empirically grounded account of gendered exclusion that complements more abstract philosophical critiques. Its focus on the structural conditions of opinion formation illuminates how formal inclusion coexists with substantive exclusion --- a dynamic directly relevant to understanding how colonized peoples can be formally included while remaining substantively excluded.

  abstract = {The article's main argument is that a public sphere forms a constructive arena for citizenship practice if we by citizenship understand four components: rights, responsibilities, participation and identity as formulated by Gerard Delanty. The Habermasian (re)working of the concept remains an essential contribution to theories of democracy and of political participation. With this in mind, the author's ambition is to address and to rework a specific type of public: an opinion-forming public within a framework of feminist political theory. The article is informed by the assumption that an opinion-forming public sphere is a central democratic arena in which the process of deliberation has intrinsic value. The analysis draws on a debate where a broader concept of communication than the one proposed by Habermas has been discussed. Iris Marion Young's concept of 'inclusive communication', greeting, rhetoric and narratives, is an attempt to widen public communication and further an ambition of constructing a concept of a more inclusive public sphere. The author suggests that feminist political theory goes some of the way towards reconstructing a concept of an opinion-forming public sphere within a Habermasian framework. The empirical cases (the women's rights as human rights movement and a Scandinavian feminist debate) illustrate how participants in such a public can use the public arena for internal learning by employing a broad concept of communication such as narratives and storytelling as a means of politicizing their situation and as a consciousness-raising and identity-giving process. The article also suggests that the positive reasoning around an extended concept of communication can be criticized. The overarching idea is that the type of communication in itself does not provide the democratic inclusion and the egalitarian communication it intends and that decisions made as a result of it can be misleading.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kavada proposes reframing the public sphere concept through feminist care ethics, arguing that care's core commitments --- vulnerability, interdependence, and relational responsibility --- can reconceptualize the democratic functions of the public sphere beyond Habermas's rationalist model. This care-informed public sphere would understand its function not merely as rational opinion formation but also as developing citizens' care capacities, processing emotions as legitimate deliberative inputs, incorporating personal testimony as a mode of argumentation, and creating intimate publics alongside general ones. Universal access is reframed through care's attention to vulnerability and interdependence.

  RELEVANCE: This recent article represents the contemporary extension of feminist critique of Habermas in a distinctly constructive direction, moving from critique toward an alternative model. Its reconstruction of the public sphere through care ethics supplements Fraser's counter-publics framework and Young's communicative democracy with an emphasis on vulnerability and embodiment that is directly relevant to understanding how non-Western, non-rationalist modes of political communication might be valued in a more inclusive democratic theory.

  POSITION: Feminist care-ethics reconstruction of the public sphere beyond Habermasian rationalism.

  abstract = {This article reframes the public sphere concept by bringing it dialogue with feminist theories of care. Care ethics foreground vulnerability and interdependence, suggesting that vulnerability is a shared condition and that we are all dependent on each other in order to survive. This helps to rethink the role of the public sphere within the democratic system, as a space not only for opinion formation, but also for the development of citizens with the necessary skills and dispositions to take care of the issues discussed in public. A focus on care also aids in reconsidering public affairs as issues that are intimately connected with needs and vulnerabilities; listening as an act of care; the processing of emotions as a key function of the deliberative process; and personal testimony as an important type of argumentation. The concept of care further helps in refining the universal access principle by highlighting the importance of intimate spaces, where participants feel safe to be vulnerable, and of how these multiple publics can be interconnected through mobilising relationships of interdependence. Finally, it allows us to consider "care work" for communication infrastructure, including both media technologies and people's bodies, as a constitutive part of the public sphere.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Young argues that the ideal of impartiality in liberal and republican political theory --- which requires that citizens abstract from their particular identities, interests, and perspectives when deliberating about the common good --- is not a neutral procedural requirement but an ideological norm that systematically disadvantages women and other marginalized groups. The impartial standpoint is tacitly modeled on the dominant group's perspective while presenting itself as universal; women's and other marginalized perspectives are thus coded as "partial" and excluded from legitimate public discourse.

  RELEVANCE: This early article establishes the foundational argument that deliberative norms themselves, not merely the composition of deliberating bodies, are sites of exclusion. This thesis is foundational for understanding how the ideal speech situation's requirement of rational argumentation excludes not just empirically but normatively those whose epistemic and communicative styles deviate from the dominant standard. The argument extends naturally to colonial subjects whose communicative and epistemic traditions are dismissed as "pre-rational" or "particular" against Habermas's universal model.

  POSITION: Foundational feminist critique of the ideal of impartiality in liberal political theory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comparative study examines the selectivity of public and subaltern spheres through Habermas's and Fraser's theories, focusing on implications for human rights policies. The study finds that while both theorists offer valuable frameworks, Fraser's emphasis on subaltern counterpublics better addresses the need for inclusive human rights policy-making by incorporating marginalized voices that Habermas's model implicitly excludes through its procedural selectivity.

  RELEVANCE: This recent article provides a contemporary application of the Fraser-Habermas debate to the domain of human rights policy, demonstrating the ongoing practical relevance of feminist counter-public sphere theory for addressing structural exclusions in political institutions. The focus on human rights policy connects the theoretical debate to concrete institutional dimensions relevant to the project's concern with exclusion.

  POSITION: Applied assessment of Habermas-Fraser debate for human rights policy, favoring Fraser's counter-publics framework.

  abstract = {This study examines the selectivity of public and subaltern spheres through the theories of Juergen Habermas and Nancy Fraser, focusing on their implications for human rights policies. The objectives are defined to analyze Habermas's and Fraser's conceptualizations of public and subaltern spheres; to identify how these perspectives influence human rights policy formulation and implementation and to explore the challenges and opportunities these theories present for marginalized voices. The study's central issue is understanding the impact of public sphere selectivity on policy inclusivity and effectiveness, hypothesizing that Habermas's and Fraser's models, though insightful, differ in their implications for integrating subaltern voices. Using a qualitative methodology, the study conducts a literature review and critical analysis of Habermas's and Fraser's works. It involves reviewing key texts and secondary sources, comparing theoretical frameworks, and examining case studies of human rights policies. The findings show that while both theories offer valuable insights, Fraser's emphasis on subaltern counterpublics better addresses the need for inclusive policy-making by incorporating marginalized voices.},

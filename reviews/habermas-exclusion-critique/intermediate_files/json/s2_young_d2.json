      "abstract": "This article explains how the issue of inclusion is central to Habermas\u2019s theory of democracy and how it is deeply rooted in his conception of a political public sphere. After recalling Habermas\u2019s views on the public sphere, I present and discuss various objections raised by other critical theorists: Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nancy Fraser, Axel Honneth and Iris Marion Young. These criticisms insist on the paradoxically excluding effects of a conception of democracy that promotes civic participation in the public debate. Negt, Kluge and Fraser develop a Marxist line of analysis that question who can participate in the public sphere. Honneth and Young criticize in various ways the excluding effect of argumentation: are unargumentative speeches excluded from the public debate? I show how Habermas\u2019s model can provide some responses to these various objections by drawing inspiration from his treatment of the gap between religious and post-metaphysical world views.",

      "abstract": "Hannah Arendt has developed a theory of the importance of judgment of taste for political manners, founded on the Kantian aesthetic theory. Nowadays this theory is considered a current theoretical reference for establishing a political way to reconcile the demands of the radicalization of deliberative democracy with the need for political inclusion (Iris Marion Young, Seyla Benhabib). Albena Azmanova in her The Scandal of Reason: A Critical Theory of Political Judgment proposes an inclusive political rhetoric. The political theory founded on judgment is based on Kant\u2019s philosophy; it was developed by Arendt and has greatly influenced the current debate, as an alternative theory in which the moral basis of law can be more sensitive to human contexts; a universalist theory more adequate for dealing with the tragic dimension of human life. The theory of political judgment uses the concepts of reflective judgment and \u2018enlarged thought\u2019 as its main concepts. As a starting point, a theory like this considers the singular judgments of justice that each person makes. The background, therefore, is not a rational foundation of principles, but the capacity of rational beings to make judgments. This post-metaphysical theory of law, based on a theory of judgment, is a critique of legal positivism, but presents itself as an alternative to the idealistic theory of law. But this theoretical project has received some criticism related to the adequacy of Arendt\u2019s rereading of Kantian philosophy and her attempt to approximate Kant\u2019s reflective judgment to the Aristotelian concept of phron\u00easis. Some critics, such as Bryan Garsten, believe that Kant\u2019s rhetoric of public reason diminished and displaced the prudential faculty of judgment that Arendt is to be interested in reviving. Arendt\u2019s attempt to find a theory of judgment in Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory is not successful, in Garsten\u2019s view. Our purpose is to show that a critical theory of judicial judgment is not only possible, but necessary; Arendt\u2019s theory of judgment offers an important contribution to a critical theory of judicial judgment, particularly one devoted to the construction of a legal theory that prioritizes a politics of social inclusion. This theory proposes a critical approach to the project of the procedural conception of democracy, since it can mask social exclusion. An adequate understanding of judicial argumentation cannot forget that it happens in a rhetorical context: it is not only important what a discourse says, but how it says it. The radicalization of deliberative democracy supposes a revision of the ways judicial deliberation is thought: not by reference to universal or at least general principles, but taking into consideration what is \u2018critically relevant\u2019, with a view to remedying social injustice (following Azmanova).",

      "abstract": "Abstract This essay re-considers Karl Mannheim\u2019s notion of democratic behaviour in the context of mass society. Although the term \u2018mass society\u2019 seems archaic, it is still the precondition of democracy today. Mannheim conceptualized mass society as irrational, disintegrating Great Society and presented the remedy of Planning for Freedom to counter the crisis of mass democracy. In his remedy Mannheim advocated social education that fosters citizens\u2019 democratic interaction, and the keywords of his education were \u2018integrative behaviour\u2019 and \u2018creative tolerance\u2019. The similar orientation of his remedy can be found in much more contemporary critiques of deliberative democracy. Iris Marion Young\u2019s \u2018communicative democracy\u2019 was a version of her democratic interaction in a complex, large-scale mass society. Young\u2019s notion of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 has substantial affinity with Mannheim\u2019s integrative behaviour, both of which require the democratic attitude of hearing the other side and the readiness to self-transform. Mass society theory has relevance for contemporary democratic theory.",

      "abstract": "THERE IS A DELIBERATIVE turn in a democratic theory in the final decade of the second millennium. The article presents in a critical way the main theories of this approach. The core idea of the deliberative democracy is to justify public decisions, to give reason for the decisions made by citizens and their representatives. The theories of the deliberative democracy emerge from liberal democracy, try to change it a little bit or confront with it and propose a very new model of democracy. Joshua Cohen`s and David Miller`s theories change from aggregative to deliberative liberal democracy. Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson share the main ideas of the deliberative liberal democracy even though they rely on the theory of Habermas. Iris Marion Young gives rather an eclectic exposition of democracy which sources are liberalism, Marxism, socialism and postmodernism. John Dryzek builds his theory in similar way. His model of democracy is also eclectic and takes ideas from critical theory, postmodernism, radical democracy and ideology of ecologism. The theory of Jurgen Habermas is specific in the light of previous theories. Habermas, like others, takes ideas from very different sources but his theory is not eclectic. His theory is coherent and gives reason how \u201cinfluence\u201d which is generated in informal public opinion, is transformed into \u201ccommunicative power\u201d through the channels of political elections and is again transformed into \u201cadministrative power\u201d through legislation.",

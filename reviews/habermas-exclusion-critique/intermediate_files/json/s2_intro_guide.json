      "abstract": "Abstract Considering the criticisms of Habermas\u2019 communicative action theory, this essay problematized and reflected on another possible criticism: scholars of the theory, despite presenting a common understanding - enlightenment and emancipation of man - do not reach a consensus on what this theory represents compared to other theories and rationality types. The guiding question of the essay is: does the transition proposed by Habermas from other rationality types to the communicative concern an interparadigmatic theory or a paradigmatic leap? Methodologically, we adopted the conception of an essay according to which authors and readers need to recognize that reality can be understood in different ways. The discussion, contextualized in public administration, allowed us to understand that considering the communicative action theory as having an interparadigmatic character does not mean it is a mere gathering of other theories because it surpasses those it dialogues with, additionally presenting a radical shift. We propose that the Communicative action theory comprises a paradigmatic leap with interparadigmatic characteristics. Finally, we present implications of this discussion for Public Administration.",

At the same time Enlightenment reason includes Hobbes\u2019 and, especially, Lock\u2019s notion of many reasons in the process of agreement. In any case, Habermas discusses the question of reason with modern philosophers, from Kant, Heidegger, Derrida, Castoriadis, to Foucault and Luhmann. We may say that he is concerned about reality formulated in two main categories: reason and action. Apart from Habermas, we are not very concerned about the importance of the notion of reason3, nor about action. In our opinion, the more important thing is that reality (and its Habermas\u2019 understanding included) is in principle",

We used TCA approaches, such as the validity claims that should characterize argumentative debate and the interactive processes with \u2018lifeworld\u2019 components (culture, person and society), to create a theoretical relationship between Habermas's theory and SP practices. We propose that the TCA aligns with the objectives of a dialogic communication about science with the non-specialist public and can contribute to perspectives that emphasize dialogue about science in society. We conclude that the premises of communicative action can guide SP policies.",

However, what counts as acceptable classroom-based mathematical argumentation remains an open question. In this study, building on Habermas' theory of communicative action, we developed two analytic frameworks to examine questioning strategies used to support the validity of collective mathematical argumentation. Habermas' three components of rationality allowed us to focus on fine-grained rationality components of teacher questioning as well as teachers' intentions of asking these questions. The theory of validity claims was used to capture different forms of validating argumentation. The frameworks may help teachers to be aware of the types of questions that they are asking when aiming at supporting valid argumentation.",

Further, he documents Habermas\u2019s trajectory from his early theoretical works through his linguistic turn to the present. The study demonstrates how Habermas\u2019s philosophical work from his early theory of the public sphere to his linguistic turn establishes Habermas\u2019s theme of communicative action as a major philosophical contribution which has relevance for the many theoretical and political texts Habermas has produced in his long, distinguished, and immensely productive career. Yet, in a concluding critical section, I argue that M\u00fcller-Doohm does not adequately engage with Habermas\u2019s theoretical conceptions, downplaying his philosophical achievements while failing to explore relevant theoretical literature and philosophical debates on Habermas that have accompanied his work for decades.",

Considering the current innovation theories it is worth saying that specific approaches facing environmental sustainability are not common. Based on such scope, Industrial Ecology and Integrated Production Systems are highlighted. They are in the mainstream because they try to guide themselves not just by economic concerns, but also considering the articulation demand among different subjective and objective elements. The tendencies draw proposals to policies\u2019 transformations \u2013 regarding production methods \u2013 by placing economical, social and environmental dimensions in an inseparable way. However, even though after analyzing systems we did not identify any relation to the \u201cTheory of Communicative Action\u201d, the habermasian approach is recognized as useful to innovation processes once achieved by consensus and mutual understanding.",

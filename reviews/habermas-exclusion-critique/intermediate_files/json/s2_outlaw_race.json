      "abstract": "How have feelings, presumptions, and preconceptions concerning racialized Blackness intersected with film noir? Dan Flory relies on recent advances in philosophy of film, philosophy of emotion, cognitive film theory, and critical philosophy of race to guide his analyses of this well-known film genre. Making sense of techniques, themes, and characterizations filmmakers have used in order to structure movies into film noirs, Flory focuses on those viewer responses that are not consciously registered by higher-level forms of cognition. He argues that embodied, affective, and implicit reactions are key to understanding how film noir typically conveys ideas, feelings, and perspectives concerning race. Noir films by African American and other artists have frequently sought to elicit such embodied responses, rendering their investigation vital. In many cases, these artists have created works that aim, either explicitly or implicitly, to be filmed in the guise of philosophy by generating serious thoughtful reflection. By using advances from these theoretical subfields in conjunction with developments in mainstream, African American, and other kinds of filmmaking, Flory elucidates many under-analyzed dimensions of noir films and their intersection with racialized Blackness. Aiming to both diagnose as well as seek ways to overcome socio-political problems concerning anti-Blackness, Black invisibility, and the epistemic injustices they generate, Flory paves the way for revolutionary moral change.",

Contextualising this work within wider debates in Afropessimist philosophy, it considers how the poet\u2019s portrayal of emotional pain, depression, and numbness exemplify a form of \u2018social death\u2019 instigated by the ubiquitous violence of antiblackness. Through close readings of select sequences, it argues that Rankine frames death as an ongoing structure of African American experience, rather than a singular event. In turn, this paper also considers how her innovative and hybrid \u201cAmerican Lyric\u201d form functions to create a new grammar for Black self-expression in an ostensibly \u2018post-race\u2019 culture that obfuscates contemporary systems of racial inequality. It argues that Rankine\u2019s collection cultivates an ethics of attention to the experiences and pain of others, offering poetry as a form of \u201cexhausted hope\u201d to challenge the dehumanising force of White supremacy. \n \n \n",

It focuses on the three sharpest points of disagreement between them\u2014over (1) the nature of the political subject (actor) and her motivations for becoming political; (2) the need for normative grounds as a basis of political critique; (3) the quality of political temporality\u2014and shows how a range of African-American political thinkers have developed rigorous accounts of all three of these matters. These accounts not only expose the limitations of Ranci\u00e8re's and Honneth's views but also provide a capacious theoretical framework able to hold their disagreements in productive tension with each other.",

First, it serves as a critical introduction to the most recent developments in contemporary African American studies and Black philosophy, focusing particularly on Afropessimism and Black Male Studies. The book explores gen-ealogies, contributions and points of contention of these movements. Second, it illustrates some possible political outcomes of these theories. Against the grain of contemporary ten-dencies to dismiss these currents as regressive or reactionary, Darkening Blackness aims to show that pessimism is a long-standing defining feature of Black radicalism",

Specifically, the analysis shows how bringing into conversation Wynter\u2019s account on the overrepresentation of Western (White) Man with recent theorizations of \u2018racialized affects\u2019 and the \u2018coloniality of the affects\u2019 can make a significant contribution to unsettling affective norms and practices of contemporary schooling in societies shaped by ongoing White supremacy. The essay examines how White European bourgeois theories of affect are implicated in both colonization and racialization, thus naming and disrupting racialization can enable the use of affect theory in education to become more attentive to plural affective perspectives and histories (\u2018minor feelings\u2019) and to support more just and equitable schooling.",

While not directly in dialogue, Wynter's decolonial reading of Foucault's (1994) epistemic ruptures enriches Brennan's inquiry into this \"forgetting,\" given that callous, repeated acts of cruelty characteristic of Western imperialism and slavery required a denial of the capacity to sense suffering in others perceived as differently human. Supplementing Brennan with Wynter, we can better describe the limits of sympathy discourses as resting on identification and perceived sameness. In turn, Brennan (posthumously) comes to Wynter's defense in her call for a new science of plural cultures to redefine the human, which some have interpreted as a positivist misreading of Frantz Fanon (2008). Brennan and Wynter alike have been criticized for their appeals to science; yet, I defend their respective proposals for social-scientific inquiry with support from Brennan's response to the 1996 Sokal Hoax: the influence of the social on the biological body is, indeed, difficult to study, but this does not invalidate the inquiry as such.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article critically interrogates the unequal structures of life-saving inclusion and life-shortening exclusion that underpin modern citizenship regimes. By connecting the coloniality of citizenship framework with critical and reflexive migration studies on the nexus of death, migration, and citizenship, it introduces the concept of the necropolitics of statelessness. Bringing the works of Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Achille Mbembe, Orlando Patterson, Sylvia Wynter, and Frantz Fanon into dialogue with each other and with the work of Caribbean human rights professionals and activists, the article captures how the racialized and gendered exclusion from national membership produces deadly effects. To illustrate and support this argument, two interconnected case studies from the Caribbean are spotlighted: the 1937 Parsley Massacre, which targeted Haitians and those presumed to be of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, and the 2013 La Sentencia ruling, which rendered Dominicans of Haitian descent stateless and disposable. The necropolitics of statelessness is thus conceptualized as an extreme manifestation of the coloniality of citizenship, highlighting how colonial histories of violence and their present-day legacies perpetuate conditions where stateless individuals \u2013 whose very humanity is systematically denied \u2013 are subject to sovereign death-making power.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Over the last two decades, Critical Terrorism Studies (CTS) has been crucial in contributing to critical research on terrorism that challenges the troublesome assumptions about \u201cterrorism\u201d developed in the field of Terrorism Studies, and which investigates the complexities that shape (counter-)terrorism in various socio-political contexts, especially so in the \u201cpost-9/11 era\u201d. This has, however, also enabled the production of the identity of a uniquely critical terrorism researcher which, I argue in this article, is acutely underwritten by colonial epistemologies and assumptions that underpin \u201cterrorism\u201d. By drawing upon relevant insights from decolonial scholarship on the link between identity and knowledge production, especially through my engagement with Sylvia Wynter\u2019s discourse on \u201cMan and the coloniality of being\u201d, this article aims to problematise the CTS researcher as a specific idea of Man (usually Western/white/bourgeoise/heterosexual) shaped by various descriptive statements including those about emancipation and inclusion that seeks to legitimise researchers in this sub-field as progenitors of genuine discourses about \u201cterrorism\u201d. By de-centring the CTS researcher through reflecting on my own research practices, choices and priorities, the article contributes to CTS debates on methodology as well as to the debate on \u201cterrorism expertise\u201d. It concludes by offering some reflections on the future of CTS.",

Initially, it expounds on the inextricable link between sociogeny, coloniality of being, and race to examine how discourses and social practices establish racial-colonial structures of subjugation and exploitation. The authors posit that decolonial sociography constitutes not only a counter-cartography but also a methodological shift towards examining the interconnected symbolic and material structures that shape the experiences of colonized and negatively racialized communities. Decolonial sociography situates racial-colonial processes as geopolitically entangled within the modern/colonial world system and recognizes that racialization is distinctively configured within specific historical contexts. In conjunction with Fanon\u2019s and Wynter\u2019s work, the article invokes Glissant\u2019s poetics of relations to highlight the persistence of resistance and relational modes of existence that counteract the totalizing and homogenizing effects of modernity/coloniality\u2019s sociogenesis of race.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Decolonial and post-colonial critiques have shown how rights naturalise a normatively white, Western bourgeois, and appropriative subject, while negating other forms of being and subjectivity. Given the disquiet around rights and their subject, reimagining the subject of rights calls on us to think \u2018after rights?\u2019. Thinking \u2018after rights?\u2019, and insisting on the question mark, I argue, entails seeking the \u2018undared shape\u2019 (Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire) of rights untethered from the figure of sovereign Man. Sylvia Wynter\u2019s historical-philosophical critique of Man, and search for the human \u2018after Man\u2019, are central for understanding the colonial-modern order and the role of rights within this. Extending Wynter\u2019s orientations, I first analyse how rights are implicated in modernity-coloniality\u2019s material and symbolic violences. Second, I examine Wynter\u2019s amplification of sociopoetic struggles \u2013 those wide-ranging modes of sociality and cultural, survival practices \u2013 by Man\u2019s enslaved and colonised Others. Such struggles aimed to displace Man as locus of colonial-modern structures, forging new meanings and modes of world-making untethered from this hegemonic figure. Importantly for rights and world politics scholarship, sociopoetic struggles work with abolitionist-reparative intent towards modernity-coloniality and its master subject. Finally, I consider what renarrating the human outside Man's horizon \u2013 as abnormative, insovereign and anti-individualist praxis \u2013 means for human rights.",

This legislation introduced changes to Canada\u2019s immigration regulations, which include the practice of polygamy as a basis for refusing foreign applicants and deporting foreign nationals. I address how insights from the field of evolutionary psychology were applied in the Polygamy Reference and what discursive and material resonances they had in the Zero Tolerance Act. Drawing on the work of Sylvia Wynter, I situate these judicial and legal developments in relation to violence, within colonial formations of state power, and as forces supporting white supremacy through the continuing valorization of monogamy as a foundational aspect of social and sexual citizenship in Canada.",

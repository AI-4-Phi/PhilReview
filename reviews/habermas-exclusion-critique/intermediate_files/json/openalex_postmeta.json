      "abstract": "Abstract This article discusses the debate on gender-equal inheritance in Tunisia. In it, Maeve Cooke\u2019s conception of authoritarian versus non-authoritarian practical reasoning is applied to see whether binaries, like religious versus secular, are existent in the public debate on equal inheritance in Tunisia. The mapping of the debate shows the existence of three sets of arguments: jurisprudential/textual, sociological, and legal. Proponents of equal inheritance base their arguments primarily on legal, then sociological, then textual grounds, whereas law opponents base their arguments on textual, then legal, then sociological grounds. The weakness of the sociological arguments of law opponents is evident when stating that a gendered division of labor within the family still exists without providing statistics or empirical evidence to back up that claim. Through shared categories and grounds, the discussions in Tunisia share a common language in the public sphere, allowing for the reduction of authoritarian tendencies and longstanding polarization through public deliberation.",

My focus is on making sense of whiteness as a power structure that also manifests itself through practices of epistemic exploitation. I contend that the activity of epistemic exploitation, which is geared towards credibility excess attribution, may be understood as an operational activity of what Axel Honneth has termed \u2018ideological recognition\u2019. This social pathology is potentially the most concerning of recognition abuses because it mutates the affective dimension of approval and encouragement, a dimension which all intersubjectively vulnerable agents require for a healthy practical relation-to-self. I argue that whereas practices of manifestly unsubtle violent silencing and invisibilisation aim to deprive marginalised and oppressed groups of that affective dimension by obvious practices of degrading, delegitimating, and dehumanising, the practices of epistemic exploitation and ideological recognition both aim to marginalise and oppress precisely through discourses of approval and encouragement that are degrading, delegitimating, and dehumanising. In this way, credibility deficits do not have a monopoly on painful humiliation and trauma.",

      "abstract": "As we move into the global century, several aspects of social and economic life are changing and post-industrial shifts are unparalleled by virtue of the interconnectedness that brings together the corners of the globe. New technologies, new economic relationships, new social processes, and new political developments are all characteristics of globalization (Hudson and Lowe, 2004: 22) in a post-industrial age featured by information, innovation, finance and services. As the world has contracted, people\u201fs quality of life has changed regardless of where they live. In fact, the propagation of free market mindsets in emerging economies has created collective network connections with considerable good but pervasive inequalities as well. A fundamental aim of this book is to argue that these changes are part of a economic transition to post-industrialism associated with risks and inequalities that shape human experience in the midst of a formidable global financial climate. There is an obvious tension with this. On the one hand, life expectancy, health statuses and per capital incomes are at an all-time high and many feudal practices have been relegated to the past (Phillipson, 2006). On the other hand, vast numbers of people struggle with poverty and significant pockets of poverty portend more than lack of income. Those living on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder labor under the burden of avoidable, lifestyle diseases, hunger and related maladies, not to mention myriad social risks (Turner, 2008). Those on the upper reaches of the same ladder garner disproportionate shares of the resources and are able to support comfortable lifestyles.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a synthesis of time-honoured pedagogical approaches to develop wisdom suitable to address the urgent problem-solving requirement of the modern university. During these last 30 years, I have employed a range of critical, interpretivist, qualitative research methods to examine archival and archaeological evidence and conduct cross-cultural and often comparative and international case studies to study wisdom. My central concern has been to understand how teachers across diverse locations throughout history have learned to develop wisdom and how they have educated others to such understandings. As part of this work, I examined the modern university and its capacity to engage with local knowledge and wisdom. Over the course of analysis, I find that one of the constraints of scaling up institutions for learning wisdom into the now global model of the university is that universities have forgotten how to develop wisdom in the race towards industrialisation, colonisation, and neo-liberalism within the scientific paradigm. One of the early sacrifices of such scaling up was the ability of the university to preserve an intention to develop the wisdom of its students. Therefore, distant memory now is the ideation of wisdom that many societies and civilisations, and their institutions of higher learning, are in danger of forgetting the pedagogical pathway to do so. The paper begins with an examination of the long history of pedagogies for the development of wisdom. I then briefly discuss the methodological aspects of this paper and explain my key terms: information, knowledge and wisdom, followed by an examination of wisdom through the lens of the teaching and learning modalities of the Oral, Written, and Printing. My synthesis of wisdom artefacts and stories about pedagogy suggests that while wisdom is individually sensed, understood, and lived phenomenologically, its meaning is latent, socially agreed, and constrained in terms of how and if universities might cultivate its essential elements. Taking a Janussian backward- and forward-looking view, I propose a remembering and reconnecting approach to educating for wisdom through purposeful consideration of what we know about time-honoured pedagogies for teaching and learning wisdom, what are its current constraints, and what are its future opportunities in the university into the new postmodern, planetary, virtual education era.",

Drawing primarily on the writings of sociologist Robert K. Merton, the thinkers of the Vienna Circle, and Charles Sanders Peirce, I make some of these assumptions explicit by telling a longer story about the evolution of social thinking about the normative structure of science from Merton's articulation of his well-known norms (those of universalism, communism, organized skepticism, and disinterestedness) to the present. I show that while Merton's norms and his intertwinement of these with the underlying mechanisms of democratic order provide us with an especially good starting point to explore and clarify the commitments and values of science, Leonelli's broader, more context-responsive, and more holistic vision of the epistemic integrity of data scientific understanding, and her discernment of the global and biospheric scope of its moral-practical reach, move beyond Merton's schema in ways that effectively draw upon important critiques. Stepping past Merton, I argue that a combination of situated universalism, methodological pluralism, strong objectivity, and unbounded communalism must guide the responsible and sustainable data work of the future.",

      "abstract": "Any Filipino who is asked the question \"What is a Filipino?\" will be hard-pressed to find a quick and ready answer.Much of how Filipinos think of themselves is usually based on notions that spring from an understanding of their historical and cultural development that is either inadequate or incomplete. HowFilipinos think of themselves, and who they think they are, is largely determined by what they read.For others, by what they are told by those who read what was written about them.Much of what is read by Filipinos about themselves was written by, or is based on what was written by their former colonizers.What eventually becomes apparent to an interested and discerning observer is that the various peoples and cultures that are present in the Philippines -Muslims, Christians, Tribal, Chinese, and mestizos in a variety of shades-are counterposed to each other.This brings into high relief the successful implementation of the divide-and-conquer tactic of the country's colonizers 1.Who are the Filipinos?2. How do these various peoples of the Philippines identify themselves? 3. What are the factors that influence the way they see themselves?Many people of present day Third World countries colonized by Spain, France, and Portugal are issues of miscegenation, referred to as mestizo in Spanish, or metisse in French.Ashcroft et al. (2002:136) say that these \"terms ... semantically register the idea of a mixing of races and/or culture.\"By extension, many oftoday's Mexicans, Venezuelans, Colombians, and others in the Central and South American countries, or for that matter Filipinos would not be present were it not for Spanish miscegenation.While it is true that Spain was not the only European country responsible for such an outcome, I choose for this research to confine it only to this extent without bringing in the effects of the English, French, Dutch, German, Belgian, Italian and other European colonizing projects.Otherwise, it would take this research too far afield.Moreover, such an enterprise requires a totally separate research effort.In any case, it is instructive to note that nowadays, according to Ashcroft et al. (2002: 136-3 7), mestizo and metisse reflect a view thatmiscegenation and interchange between the different cultural diasporas had produced new and powerful synergistic cultural forms, and that these cultural and racial exchanges might be the place where the most energized aspects of the new cultures reside [emphasis in the original).The use of these terms has been largely confined in the Franco-Hispano areas of colonial influence, although the English have used the word \"creole\" instead, which finds its equivalent in the Spanish word criollo.",

In investigating this question, the study will operate in three&#13;\\ntheory-driven sections borrowing from critical theory, post-structuralism and postcolonialism. Each section will provide a brief presentation of the main theoretical arguments&#13;\\ndeveloped by one philosopher, illustrated with extensive direct quotes from relevant original works. This presentation will then be followed by a critical summary. For the sake of illustration, theoretical arguments will then be confronted with empirical observations based on my own participation in the 'Tunisia in Transition' project. Section one&#13;\\nwill argue in favour of the possibility of genuinely horizontal argumentative engagement on the basis of Habermas' discourse 'ethics' and theory of communicative action. By contrast, section two will introduce Foucault\u2019s genealogical account of the power/knowledge interplay to reject the possibility of discursive spaces that would be in a position of exteriority&#13;\\nto power relations. Section three will then bring in the writings of Spivak on the&#13;\\ndouble aporia of representation in order to highlight the practical obstacles to a subversive&#13;\\nuse of the Master\u2019s knowledge by the subaltern for genuinely emancipatory purposes.",

My inquiry focuses on demagoguery--a term dating from classical antiquity--in order to implicate it in African-American political discourses, in particular those of Tavis Smiley's former State of the Black Union, 2000-2010. Indeed, I posit that Smiley's former annual event is an important site for thinking about modern black demagoguery and the aestheticization of black politics. Through close readings and original transcriptions of Louis Farrakhan (b. 1933), Cornel West (b. 1953), and Michael Eric Dyson (b. 1958), I show that the inevitable practice of demagoguery--what the dissertation theorizes as the \"allegorical,\" \"epideictic,\" and \"polytropic\" modes of emplotment--now threatens to undermine the political opportunities afforded by the success of the modern civil rights movement, even though it sustains the illusion, today, of an autochthonous black public sphere.",

      "abstract": "In 1959, Reinhardt Koselleck published Critique and Crisis, in which he argued that the dominant tendency of political theory since the Enlightenment has been to subsume the political under the moral. Since then, other thinkers have echoed Koselleck\u2019s contention, and have described recent liberal political theory in particular as a \u2018flight from the political\u2019 (Freeden, 2005, 2008). In this situation, one of the main challenges confronting contemporary Western political theory is to end the flight from the political by clarifying what the concept of the political involves. But how is this to be done? &#13;\\nThe first step is to see what guidance can be got from five of the most notable recent responses to this situation, each of which would be defended with varying degrees of success as offering a genuinely political theory. One has been made by neo-Kantian liberal thinkers whose concept of the political is best represented by the work of Rawls. The second has been made by defenders of a very different form of neo-Kantianism generally called discourse theory and best represented by J\u00fcrgen Habermas. The third may be described as the agonal theory of the political, represented here by the work of Chantal Mouffe. The fourth response is the postmodern concept of the political, of which I shall take the late Richard Rorty as the main representative. Finally, there is the pragmatic, or modus vivendi, concept of the political represented by the thought of John Gray.&#13;\\nAfter examining how these five influential schools of thought have attempted to theorize the political, I will turn to a small group of contemporary political theorists \u2013 notably, Michael Freeden at Oxford, Raymond Geuss and John Dunn at Cambridge, and Margaret Canovan, formerly of Keele University - whom I will suggest have been more successful than the representatives of the five schools just mentioned in pointing out the manner in which the future study of the political should proceed. In the final part of the paper I will consider, albeit briefly, how the concept of the political has been theorized in non-Western thought&#13;\\n",

      "abstract": "in the Philippines, Habermasian discourse takes the form of a prescription for political or social reform which favors \"Western educated rationalities.\"In contrast to Habermasian discourse theory, Rodriguez explores an alternative critical theory of society grounded in \"indigenous forms of inquiry.\"For Rodriguez, the legitimacy of critical indigenous discourse is not simply the justification of indigenous terms, but, rather, the intellectual articulation of \"the value of their forms of knowing on their own terms.\"A more critical critical theory then demonstrates the epistemic value of \"alternative rationalities,\" that is to say, their own peculiar ways of meaning-giving.To quote Rodriguez: \"These alternative meaning giving systems could allow for the most authentic critique of the dominant rationality which critical theory fundamentally seeks to realize.\"The works of Salazar, Ileto, Almario, and Nono, Rodriguez argues, are notable examples of indigenous critical theory.Meanwhile, Ranilo B. Hermida's \"Towards a Critical Theory of Philippine Society\" may be read as a direct contrast to the position of Rodriguez.While, on the one hand, Rodriguez criticizes Habermas for his Western-centric discourse, Hermida, on the other hand, rehearses in detail the basic presuppositions of Habermas' theory of communicative action: from the critique of positivism, to the emphasis of the normative import of human interests, down to the procedural workings of communicative rationality.Hermida, then, uses this Habermasian framework to articulate a vision of a \"critical theory of Philippine society.\"This localized critical theory, according to Hermida, necessitates a reevaluation of the significance of philosophymore specifically, \"we must reflect on the study and teaching of philosophy in our country.\"This reevaluation entails factoring in the historical upheavals that shaped Philippine society in the past three decades (the three people power revolts) for they, as Hermida intimates, reflect the nuances of our societal problems and how we have collectively responded to these problems.This reevaluation of philosophy, moreover, entails a rethinking of the role of philosophy courses in the various curricula offered in schools and universities.Is philosophy taught as primum inter pares or unum inter pares?Are we teaching philosophy in the spirit of communicative interdisciplinarity? Do our philosophy courses address issues regarding the oppressive tendencies of our educational and economic systems?In other words, we must be able to teach philosophy in such as a way that theory and practice are combined.Hermida notes that Habermas is a philosopher that exemplifies that union of theory and practice, inasmuch as the latter wrote against the backdrop of historical events in Europe.In this context, philosophy can only become relevant if its center is the present historical situation, that is to say, when it engages with the public sphere of reason.Jeffry V.

      "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of mixed race people in Britain and in Further Education, the study of mixed race identity remains an under-researched area, and little or no research appears to have been done on mixed race identity in relation to the Further Education sector. By bringing mixed race to the forefront of discussion, this PhD thesis endeavours to open up a space for interrogating some much vaunted concepts of personhood and equity evident in the theoretical literature on identity and in education policy. The thesis explores how normative theories and discourses underlying political and cultural constructions of personhood and equity are represented in a selection of recent UK post compulsory education policy texts, and uses the case of -10 mixed-race women studying in Further Education colleges in Inner London to identify similarities and discrepancies between theory, policy and experience. The empirical investigation involves policy analysis and semi-structured interviews with mixed race women.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nDiscourse analysis and content analysis are the main methods used to analyse the data. The theories and discourses of personhood and equity identified in the literature and the policy documents are compared with the discourses articulated by the respondents on their constructions of self, their experiences of education, and on their opinions on government/education policy discourses. The thesis seeks to contribute to ongoing debates around identity and equality, and to provide some insights which may be helpful in moving us beyond the universalist/relativist impasse towards a concept of personhood in which identifies may be recognised simultaneously as 'fixed' and as 'fluid'. It also hopes to provide a useful source for sociologists and education policy makers in working towards more equitable policy in the field of education.",

The enquiry into the dimensions and complexities of the socio-political organization and the political substance of individual human agents will be conducted with the intellectual assistance of the postmodernist turn of thought. I will interrogate and develop a specifically Foucauldian reading of international politics and the emerging global world order as well as situate Foucault's insights and theorizing in a cosmopolitan framework, which calls for a progressive re-conceptualization of the dimensions of power and the modalities of state-citizen autonomy, and sovereignty.\\nThe thesis will proceed through five stages of analysis: (i) examination of freedom and self-creation as foundational and fundamental to the cosmopolitan citizenship; (ii) investigation of governmentality, power and the role of personal and political resistance in shaping new horizons of political order (iii) development of a structural approach to cosmopolitan democracy; enhanced by (iv) decoupling of identity from citizenship, and prompted by (v) an inquiry into and recalibration of the political space and sovereignty of states and political agents. I will contend for a conception of citizenship, illuminated by a postmodernist lens of analysis, set in a cosmopolitan framework and premised upon a notion of a layered and constituted dialectic, as the most adroit model for a re-articulation of the spirit of democratic qua cosmopolitan citizenship in the world of increasingly displaced loyalties, porous identities, and atrophied civic commitments.\\nThe study aims to inquire into the possibilities of meaningfully addressing the fundamental question in political theory, that of: how is the state to be organized in an era of globalization accompanied by an unprecedented compression of space and time, and re-spatialization of socio-economic and political relations. The thesis will conclude with a synthesis of proposed theoretical assumptions that are to serve as the structural basis and philosophical guidance for the institutionalization of measures conducive to the enactment and perpetuation of cosmopolitan consciousness and cosmopolitical practice.",

Across contemporary life, individuals invoke notions of an inner self that has been maimed by oppressive norms and practices, or that would be harmed if it assimilated, conformed, or otherwise departed from who it was. From transgender individuals seeking to become the gender they feel they truly are, to indigenous groups seeking exemptions from equality laws, a variety of groups today cast their political claims in terms of authenticity. However, in the past quarter century, such appeals have been criticized by scholars from across the humanities and social sciences, who fault authenticity for stipulating regulatory notions of group identity, stigmatizing those who fall outside its norms, and relying on untenable notions of selfhood and self-knowledge. Some have even called for abandoning the term. The dissertation responds to these critiques and argues for a renewed appreciation of authenticity in political life. Through an engagement with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and writings from American social movements from the sixties and today, I formulate a framework for appealing to the term that departs its problematic ontological grounds and is attuned to its political risks. Each chapter responds to a particular challenge facing such appeals, from the status of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cself\u00e2\u0080\u009d they imply, to their claims of genuine self-knowledge, to the risks of exclusion, and to the ways they can blur the public/private line. In addressing these critiques, I show that there are good reasons to continue to value authenticity: appeals to the term may enable marginalized groups to counter oppressive representations of themselves, mobilize individuals around visions of selfhood and community, facilitate critiques of social norms, and animate practices of resistance.",

      "abstract": "Political solidarity cannot be practiced by an individual in isolation; it characterizes groups, both as a descriptive and as a normative concept.But what are the boundaries of the solidaristic group?This paper takes on the assumption that \"solidarity has its limits.\"I argue that in order to understand what solidarity is, we have to understand its reach.The bounds of solidarity are inclusive, expansive, and fluid.Solidarity is inclusive because it has no membership criteria and no penalty for free-riders.Solidarity is expansive insofar as the causes which it addresses often require participants to seek deeper understanding of the social and political conditions which give rise to the need for solidarity.Solidarity is fluid because it connects seemingly disparate causes, and it has a tendency to transform in response to both the need for and the effect of social change.Understanding these aspects of solidarity's reach helps to conceptualize the unique moral relations of solidarity.",

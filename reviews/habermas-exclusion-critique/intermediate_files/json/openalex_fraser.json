      "abstract": "While it is commonly agreed that language standardisation was an integral feature of the historical formation of the modern nation state, current debates on globalisation and its effects on the nation state rarely address language issues in more than a superficial fashion. Yet the quadrupling of the number of English speakers in the last half-century and other changes associated with \u2018global English\u2019 would seem to have more substantial political implications. Particularly in the recent wave of discussions of cosmopolitanism, language questions seem to lurk below the surface but are rarely addressed explicitly or comprehensively. Important exceptions to this neglect of current language issues include Daniele Archibugi, who addresses these questions head on, and Nancy Fraser's most recent attempt to rethink Habermas' critical theory of the public sphere. This article agrees with both Archibugi and Fraser that language is an important, even central, aspect of political responses to processes of globalisation, specifically cosmopolitanism. However, I argue that Antonio Gramsci's approach to the politics of language in the early twentieth century highlights the insufficiency of Archibugi's reliance on the metaphor of Esperanto as well as the intractable nature of Fraser's critique for any critical theory of global public sphere(s), despite her attempt to advance such a theory. I do this by looking at Gramsci's critique of Esperanto from 1918 and his later prison writings concerning language politics in Italy. Gramsci, I argue, provides a much more adequate approach to contemporary questions of the politics of language, which includes an understanding of the continued role of the state which is most often obscured both by cosmopolitan perspectives and by much research on global English in fields outside political science.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \"Public sphre\" is often used by historians of modern Latin America without much concern about its theoretical and methodological implications. Some historians have used it as a model to fit evidence about public debates and politics during the modern period, yet few have engaged it as a theory with deeper methodological and conceptual implications. This article will review the historical literature that has applied Habermas's ideas to Latin American history. Focusing on a few particularly important books, the article will examine potential avenues for research and comparisons. Rather than becoming a new orthodoxy for the study of the region, the theory of the public sphere is establishing a dialogue among historians interested in intellectual phenomena and political discourse (most of them centered on the history of liberalism after independence) and those historians whose interest in social formations have framed their study in terms of hegemony and class domination. The article will argue that a critical use of Habermas's ideas (one that is more systematic about the gender and class exclusions built into the bourgeois public sphere, and that problematizes the connections between the specific development of capitalism in peripheral regions and their embrace of European political traditions) could yield useful results in terms of new research and an inclusive synthesis of recent literature interested in politics, culture and hegemony in Latin America. Notes 1J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (Cambridge, MA, 1991). I am indebted to Tom Klubock, Thom Rath, Federico Sor and Mary Kay Vaughan for their comments on earlier drafts. This article was also discussed at the Columbia University's Department of History graduate faculty workshop and at the New School's workshop of Latin American Studies. I thank Karl Wennerlind, Herbert Sloan, Claudio Lomnitz and Paul Gootenberg for their comments. 2The danger, of course, is that of creating 'un Mapa del Imperio, que ten\u00eda el tama\u00f1o del imperio y coincid\u00eda puntualmente con \u00e9l'. 'El rigor de la ciencia' in Jorge Luis Borges, Obras completas II 1952\u20131972 (Barcelona, 1996). This map will have Mexico as the centre. It is a result of my background and I hope it can be excused as a geographical convention. 3See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures.

See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Discourse ethics: notes on a program of philosophical justification' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (Cambridge, 1990). For the normative implications of the public-sphere model, see Nancy Fraser, 'Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy', Social Text, nos 25/26 (1990). See also Thomas A. McCarthy, The Critical Theory of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, first MIT Press paperback edition (Cambridge, 1981), chap. 1; J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Ciencia y t\u00e9cnica como 'ideolog\u00eda' (Mexico City, 1993). Implicit in Habermas's idea of 'communicative rationality' is 'the central experience of the unconstrained, unifying, consensus-bringing force of argumentative speech': J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, vol. 1, Reason and the Rationalization of Society, trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston, 1984), 10. 5Arthur Strum, 'A bibliography on the concept of \u00d6ffentlichkeit', New German Critique, lxi (1994). Habermas refers to 'seminal theories', like those by Freud and Marx, that 'inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research' resulting in 'hybrid discourses' that may be criticized from the academic establishment but could generate 'new research traditions'. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Philosophy as stand-in and interpreter' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, op. cit., 15. 6The OED provides two examples of the term, both dated 1992. See entries for 'maternalize' and 'nonsensification', Oxford English Dictionary (available online at: http://www.oed.com/). For the parallel with Weber see Joan B. Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution (Ithaca, 1988), 10. 7Habermas links the public sphere with his theory of communicative action at a 'fundamental' level: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Further reflections on the public sphere', Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, 1997), 422, 41. Other scholars, mentioned below, have already suggested the need to confront analyses based on Gramsci and Habermas. 8Habermas's initial definition is tentative and contains the diversity of issues outlined above: 'The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labour. The medium of this political confrontation was peculiar and without historical precedent: people's public use of their reason.' See Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27. See also J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article', New German Critique, iii (1974). On the historical character of the definition, see Moishe Postone, 'Political theory and historical analysis' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit. 9James Van Horn Melton, The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe (New York, 2001), 10, 12. 10For similar agendas see E.

I owe this reference to Samuel Moyn. 14Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27, 55; Melton, The Rise, op. cit.; Daniel Gordon, 'Philosophy, sociology, and gender in the Enlightenment conception of public opinion', French Historical Studies, xvii, 4 (1992), 889, 901; Keith Michael Baker, 'Defining the public sphere in eighteenth-century France: variations on a theme by Habermas' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 202. 15Roger Chartier, The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution, trans.

A similar census would probably be impossible today. See also Peter Uwe Hohendahl, 'The public sphere: models and boundaries' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 108. For an example of these possibilities see Madeleine Hurd, Public Spheres, Public Mores, and Democracy: Hamburg and Stockholm, 1870\u20131914 (Ann Arbor, 2000). 17See a discussion of the implications of this from the point of view of Mexican history in Pablo Piccato, 'Introducci\u00f3n: \u00bfModelo para armar?

See also Richard A. Warren, Vagrants and Citizens: Politics and the Masses in Mexico City from Colony to Republic (Wilmington, 2001), 170. After independence, 'Lo radicalmente nuevo es la creaci\u00f3n de una escena p\u00fablica': Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 13, 23, 87. This parallels Benedict Anderson's claim that 'the convergence of capitalism and print technology \u2026 created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation', and his focus on American Creole identities as early examples of this process. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (New York and London, 1983), 46. Concepts like el pueblo or lo p\u00fablico also had a history that illustrated the incorporation of traditional and modern notions, as explored by Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 'Reflexiones sobre la terminolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica del liberalismo' in Carlos Illades, Brian Connaughton and Sonia P\u00e9rez Toledo (eds), Construcci\u00f3n de la legitimidad pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico (Zamora, 1999). 20Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 30. See Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Penser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (Paris, 1978). For Palti, Guerra's use of Habermas lacked a 'strong' critique of the public-sphere model and failed to recognize Raymond Kosseleck's work as a necessary antecedent. Furet and Cochin were decisive in Guerra's work to strengthen that critique, without embracing 'las teor\u00edas multiculturalistas \"posmodernas\"'. El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 Palti, 'Guerra y Habermas: ilusiones y realidad de la esfera p\u00fablica Latinoamericana' in Erika Pani and Alicia Salmer\u00f3n (eds), Conceptualizar lo que se ve: Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Guerra historiador, homenaje (Mexico City, 2004), 466. 21See Dena Goodman, 'Public sphere and private life: toward a synthesis of current historiographical approaches to the Old Regime', History and Theory, xxxi, 1 (1992), 8, 12. Guerra's explicit rejection of Habermas's Marxism in Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 86n, 87, 14. For studies inspired by Guerra's insights and a closer connection to local contexts, see Francois-Xavier Guerra and Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (eds), Los espacios p\u00fablicos en Iberoam\u00e9rica: Ambig\u00fcedades y problemas: Siglos XVIII\u2013XIX (Mexico, 1999). For the public sphere as part of the politicization of new national societies, see Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez Bernaldo, 'Sociabilidad, espacio urbano y politizaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Buenos Aires (1820\u20131852)' in Hilda Sabato and Alberto Rodolfo Lettieri (eds), La vida pol\u00edtica en la Argentina del siglo XIX: armas, votos y voces (Buenos Aires, 2003), 199. 22Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 12, 101. Such characterization of the socio-economic impact and causes of the revolutions of independence is challenged in John Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750\u20131940 (Princeton, 1988); Eric Van Young, The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology, and the Mexican Struggle for Independence, 1810\u20131821 (Stanford, 2001). 23Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 17, 91, 234. The Habermasian focus on 'a new, autonomous, free, and sovereign public' implies a marked alternative from Furet's Tocquevillian emphasis on associations and modes of sociability as the base for a modern public opinion. Chartier, Cultural Origins, op. cit., 16\u201317. 24Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 52, 99. Guerra's emphasis on culture fits well with older visions of 'Latin American culture' as something clearly identifiable; for Edmundo O'Gorman, this common identity meant that the influence of the United States is negligible in the emergence of a Latin American political culture. Edmundo O'Gorman, 'Hegel y el moderno panamericanismo', Letras de M\u00e9xico, ii, 8 (1939). See Charles Hale, 'Edmundo O'Gorman y la historia nacional', Signos Hist\u00f3ricos, ii, 3 (2000), 17, 24. Absent is a problematization of neo-colonialism as an informal and subordinate mode of entering modernity. See Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi, The Contemporary History of Latin America, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1993). 25McEvoy, La utop\u00eda republicana, op. cit., 11. 26McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit. For similar insights, to be examined below, see \u00c1ngel Rama, The Lettered City, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1996). 27McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit. 28Rafael Rojas, La escritura de la independencia: El surgimiento de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en M\u00e9xico (Mexico City, 2003), 17, 34, 35, 62. 29 ibid., 35. See also Fernando Escalante, Ciudadanos imaginarios: Memorial de los afanes y desventuras de la virtud y apolog\u00eda del vicio triunfante en la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana: Tratado de Moral P\u00fablica (Mexico, 1993).

If in the end the new nations rejected liberal monarchism, explains Rojas, it was because of the revolutionary logic of insurgency and the consequent loyalist response, but not because of any inherently democratic feature of the new public sphere.

Increasingly, these two kind of claims are polarized against one another. As a result, we are asked to choose between class politics and identity politics, social democracy and multiculturalism, redistribution and recognition. These, however, are false antitheses. Justice today requires both redistribution and recognition. Neither alone is sufficient. As soon as one embraces this thesis, however, the question of how to combine them becomes paramount. I contend that the emancipatory aspects of the two paradigms need to be integrated in a single, comprehensive framework. In this lecture, I consider two dimensions of this project. First, on the plane of moral philosophy, I propose an overarching conception of justice that can accomodate both defensible claims for social equality and defensible claims for the recognition of difference. Second, on the plane of social theory, I propose an approach that can accomodate the complex relations between interest and identity, economy and culture, class and status in contemporary globalizing capitalist society.'

Many archaeologists express the need for such spaces to construct counter-hegemonic stances, specifically connected to tourism as it allows the local communities to author their identity for visitors.

The reference to indigenous communities specifically refers to communities comprising of First Peoples/Nations within the US and Canada, as well as other indigenous peoples from around the world, such as the Maori in Australia, the indigenous groups along the Amazon in Brazil, etc. By acknowledging these communities as \u201cpublics,\u201d a political stance is established through which legitimacy of their own civil society and sovereignty is maintained as distinct from or parallel to that of the state in which they reside. Thus, I would argue that \u201cpublic archaeology\u201d is distinct from \u201cpublic interest archaeology.\u201d 11. I am indebted to Jim Costanzo (REPO History) for drawing my attention to resistance to community formations.

It is important to note a distinction between a stakeholder and publics, i.e. individuals and groups making up \u201cpublics\u201d become stakeholders when there is a specific collective investment made for a specific return in a project. This investment does not have to have a monetary value, but it may include cultural or social capital. For more on other ways to define \u201cpublic\u201d see Michael Warner, \u201cPublics and Counterpublics,\u201d Public Culture Vol. 14, No. 1 (2002), pp. 49\u201390. 15.

Porter and Salazar, \u201cHeritage Tourism, Conflict and the Public Interest\u201d; Greer et al., \u201cCommunity Based Archaeology in Australia\u201d; additionally, the discourse about archaeology and heritage overlap which often leads to the conflation of the terms. It should be clear that the concept of heritage is distinct from the practice of archaeology. They are linked in so far as archaeology is concerned with one aspect of heritage. The concept of heritage is a difficult one to define, and is mainly understood through its products, i.e. development, tourism, and management. For more on the discussion of heritage and archaeology see Ricardo Elia, \u201cICOMOS Adopts Archaeological Heritage Charter: Text and Commentary,\u201d Public Archaeology Forum, Journal of Field Archaeology Vol. 20, No. 1 (1993), pp. 97\u2013104. 17. This is a very significant separation within the concept of stewardship, with specific consequences for the North American and Australian cases dealing with issues of repatriation. 18.

A panchayat (political institution specific to India) is a council of elected members who act as liaisons between the local government and the people. Generally comprised of members from five villages under one political council, these individuals are responsible for the social, cultural, and economic wellbeing of the villages that they represent. 41. On a personal level, this was a very important moment as it legitimized my methodological insistence on working with local informants, collecting ethnographic data on local archaeological knowledge while conducting my archaeological field survey, and our active efforts to foster a sense of community, collaboration, and advocacy around the issues of archaeology and history. 42.

Anne Drost, in \u201cDeveloping Sustainable Tourism,\u201d draws attention to the results of the World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) bringing the issue of sustainable development into the international arena, which is defined as \u201cpreserving the environment while allowing for cultural, economic, social and political development.\u201d 47. For other such cases see Beltr\u00e1n and Rojas, \u201cDiversified Funding Methods,\u201d and Nuryanti, \u201cHeritage and Postmodern Tourism.\u201d 48. KCT ascertained that the most effective manner of eco-preservation was by establishing the environment (as a larger concept) to be recognized as a commodity to be packaged for consumption through eco-tourism. One of the most telling moments in the discussion was when the group was trying to get a sense of comparative pricing from other eco-tourist markets and the question came up of \u201cHow much would a tourist pay to go up a pahar (mountain/hill) to see an ancient/old cave and a waterfall?\u201d In a very real way, these questions were putting price tags on experiences with nature and, through that, on archaeology. 49. At this point, I want to draw attention to the subtext specific to archaeology in these discourses. By discussing archaeology as a part of the living \u201cnatural world\u201d and part of the ecosystem existing (literally) below ground (in some instances), there is a sense of archaeology as a type of natural resource that could therefore be exploited. 50.

Becoming an organization with a defined structure was very important in this process. In order to ensure success, the idea of public advocacy and education had to be institutionalized in some format. 52.

Also illustrating the effects this experience had on the decision making process, I include below an excerpt from my field notes to provide a more \u201creal\u201d sense of how these decisions are made in the field. This excerpt was written the evening I was invited to direct and create NKT-DP, and clearly points to the conflicting sets of ideas that were initially evoked: Isn't this what we always want \u2026 Someone to say, \u201cHere's all the money you need, now go preserve the sites and set up programs for outreach\u201d \u2026 I am uncomfortable with this and will tell him tomorrow that I cannot accept this position or money, or any \u201cofficial\u201d role in this project\u2014really? Will I really say that? Is there something I'm missing? No. I can't do it because if this project will succeed they need someone local\u2014even someone regional\u2014I am not here long enough to set up and maintain a project\u2014plus, I'm NOT the community. So, who should I choose? Am I supposed to choose or recommend? Ok, clearly, we need to talk about this some more.",

      "abstract": "AssrRAcr The practice orientation of Robert Chambers' work on Participatory Rural Appraisal (pne), which aims at enabling local people and communities to take control over their own development, has received much attention in development circles. This article attempts to shift the emphasis away from pRA's practice towards its theoretical underpinnings. The article argues that PRA's practice/ empiricist orientation causes it to be insfficiently theorised and politicised. As a result, questions about inclusiveness, the role of rnt facilitators, and the personal behaviour of elites overshadow, or sometimes ignore, questions of legitimacy, justice, power and the politics of gender and dffirence. The article draws on arguments and debates involving Habermasian 'deliberative democracy' and post-structuralist notions of power Most of those who have innovated in developing ene have been practitioners, concerned with what works. and what will work better. not academic theorists concerned with why it works. They have been searching not for new theories or principles but for new and better ways of learning and doing. For them, the power and utility of ... pRA, undertaken with rapport and self-critical rigor, are empirical facts of common experience: they know that they work, and that done well they can lead to better development. ( Chambers, 1994b: 1262) Robert Chambers' work on Participatory Rural Appraisal (pne) has become remarkably influential in Nco circles and among national and international development agencies. pRA champions local knowledge and puts forth a methodology aimed at enabling local people to take control over their own development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This essay investigates the rhetorical practices of socio-technical deliberation about free and open source (F/OS) software, providing support for the idea that a public sphere is a socio-technical ensemble that is discursive and fluid, yet tangible and organized because it is enacted by both humans and non-humans. In keeping with the empirical shift manifest in recent public sphere scholarship and Bruno Latour's idea that socio-technical deliberation is characterized by the inscription of non-humans, I describe the rhetorical manners in which volunteer citizens define and mobilize a mundane artifact\u2014a web site\u2014in a deliberation over the value of F/OS technologies for their government-funded project. Through inscription of the web site as a rhetorical resource and as the embodiment of their disposition toward computer technologies, the volunteers formed and expressed competing understandings of the role of F/OS technologies in sustaining a public sphere. I argue that these competing views are consequential, for they link technical artifacts and political agents in practice, by way of aspirations, obligations, and forms of authority. Furthermore, by claiming a form of agency for technologies in the public sphere, the proponents of F/OS technologies are inviting scholars of the public sphere to question the status assigned to technical artifacts in their investigations and theories of the public sphere.

For instance, in Jihad vs. McWorld (New York: Times Books, 1995), Benjamin Barber argues that the centripetal forces of globalism (aka McWorld) and the centrifugal forces of tribalism (aka Jihad) are to blame for the impoverishment of twentieth-century public life. The author draws a bleak picture of a world colonized by two radically opposed yet interconnected ideologies\u2014a world in which McDonald, Nike, and MTV dissolve borders from without while local communities are attempting to create new borders from within. In such a world, there is no room for alternatives and little hope for democracy. Such a bleak outlook is also manifest in R. D.

According to Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation and one of the key leaders of the movement, these principles date from the early development of computing. He explains: When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971, I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for many years. Sharing of software was not limited to our particular community; it is as old as computers, just as sharing of recipes is as old as cooking.In \"The GNU Operating System and the Free Software Movement,\" in Open Source: Voices from the Open Source Revolution, ed.

Throughout the essay, I rely on the term public life to emphasize the processual and agent-oriented perspective manifest in recent public sphere scholarship. Vie publique is also the term favored by Bruno Latour in Politiques de la Nature. 26. See in particular Hauser, \"Vernacular Dialogue\" and Vernacular Voices; Robert Asen, \"A Discourse Theory of Citizenship,\" Quarterly Journal of Speech 90 (2004): 189\u2013211; Nina Eliasoph, \"Where Can Americans Talk Politics.\" 27. Hauser, Vernacular Voices; Asen, \"A Discourse Theory of Citizenship.\" 28. In Vernacular Voices, 65, Hauser argues: Quite apart from our interaction on a particular issue, our daily conversations with coworkers, neighbors, superiors, subordinates, community and church contacts, group members, friends, and family provide countless opportunities to exchange views on public matters. Each exchange opens a discursive space that exceeds the boundaries of entirely personal and private matters. Across time these multiple exchanges include us as participants in the social conversation by which we learn and also contribute to themes that inculcate shared motives.In sum, for Hauser, civic conversations are means of public enactments that hold significant political promises. They occur whenever citizens exchange views on issues whose consequences extend to those outside the group. They can potentially unfold anywhere and around any activities with civic contributions ranging from an exposure to alternative opinions to concerted actions. 29.

      "abstract": "To attend to \"constructing languages\" and \"constructing publics\" implicates two directions of thought. A constructionist perspective problematizes and de-naturalizes the idea of \"language,\" and suggests how the fragile textuality of our talk is the result as much of ideological processes as of neurobiological constraints. To consider the construction of \"publics\" draws linguistic anthropology in new directions. While the idea that the arenas in which opinions are formed and decisions are made are the products of social work is not new (cf. Myers and Brenneis 1984), \"publics\" suggests a particular kind of arena, Flabermas's ([1962] 1991) \"public sphere, ... a category of bourgeois society.\" The concept of \"public sphere\" exposes a new arena for our attention, distinct from the interactional field of the market or the kin group, where people who live in states speak \"as citizens,\" with reference to public affairs, yet not as agents of the state. Habermas of course argued that the bourgeois public sphere flourished only ephemerally before it was captured by the culture industry with its capacity to manufacture inauthentic \"public opinion.\" Habermas has been much critized for his nostalgic commitment to the freedom and rationality of the bourgeois public sphere, as well as his neglect of the way in which it functioned as much to exclude as to include (cf. papers in Calhoun (ed.) 1992; and Robbins (ed.) 1993). The concept of \"public\" is, however, productive precisely because it sketches in the broad outlines of an important arena for the reproduction of exclusions in contemporary societies.",

In examining the work carried out by the Aymara nongovernmental organization known as the Taller de Historia Oral Andina (THOA), the essay highlights this sphere's importance as both a discursive and territorial arena where agency is expressed in the collaborative spirit of community. THOA's work is significant in strategically formulating a methodology of decolonization based on revisionist Andean historiography, territorial demands, and collective political action.",

      "abstract": "Male-dominated and sex segregated elite professional and amateur sport1 in North America constitutes a \"sport nexus\" (Burstyn, 1999; Heywood &amp; Dworkin, 2003) that combines economic and cultural influence to reinforce and perpetuate gender injustice. The sport nexus is an androcentric sex-segregated commercially powerful set of institutions that is highly visible and at the same time almost completely taken for granted to the extent that its anti-democratic impetus goes virtually unnoticed. The sport nexus\u2019s hegemonic role in defining sporting norms (Coakley &amp; Donnelly, 2004) means that its role in shaping lower level amateur and recreational sporting institutions and cultures is highly significant. Fraser (2007) defines gender justice, and hence democracy, in terms of \"participatory parity,\" that is, material and cultural equality for women. The sport nexus itself is characterized by highly gendered occupational segregation (Coventry, 2004). It further contributes to gender injustice, homophobia and transphobia by promoting the ideology of the two sex system (Fausto-Sterling, 2000) and gendering citizenship as fundamentally male (Burstyn, 1999). Feminist strategies for sport reformation attempt to reduce or eradicate the role of the sport nexus in legitimating and perpetuating gender injustice. In this article I consider the potential of these strategies and conclude with a set of recommendations for transforming organized sport at both elite and recreational levels.",

These considerations are informed by an account of the way that the public sphere developed as a concrete ideal and an object of struggle in late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Britain.",

In February 1997, the National Security Council identified the headscarf as one of the main indicators of what they called the \"Islamic threat\"-the single most important threat to the well-being and security of the country-and called for the enforcement of a ban on the headscarf in all public places, including classrooms, universities, and public offices. 2 How is it that such a simple item of clothing can turn into such a powerful disruptive force?",

      "abstract": "Recent rethinking of Habermas' Stntctural Transformatiort of the Public Sphere by The idealized image of a democratic theatre of free and equal participation in debate, they claim, has always been a fiction predicated on the mandatory silencing of entire social groups, vital social issues, and indeed, \"ot any difference that cannot be assimilated, rationalized, and subsumed\" (Hansen 1993b: 198). This is especially clear in the case of those citizens who do not or will not speak the language of civil society. The linguistic terrorism performed with a vengeance during the French Revolution and reenacted in Official English initiatives in the United States more recently, reveal to us how deeply monolingualism has been ingrained in liberal conceptions of Libert6, Egalit6, anci Fraternit6. But perhaps silencing may not be the best way to describe the fate of linguistic minorities or other marginalized groups. For, as Miriam Hansen (1993b) notes, what the more recent work on public spheres suggests is that \"the\" public sphere has never been as uniform or as totalizing as it represents itself to be. Proliferating in the interstices of the bourgeois public -in salons, cofteehouses, book clubs, working class and subaltern forms of popular culture -are numerous counterpublics that give lie to the presumed homogeneity of the imaginary public. Spurred in part by ethnic nationalist movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, speakers and writers of \"barbarous\" tongues and \"illegitimate patois\" can be seen as one among the counterpublics who avail themselves of any number of \"media\"from novels to oral poetry, from song and regional presses to, more recently, various forms of electronic mediato give expression to other kinds of social experience and perspectives on who the public is. what its interests might be, and what its voice sounds like.",

As with any such interdisciplinary assignation, there are both possibilities and challenges contained within this move: possibilities in terms of reducing IR's intellectual autism and opening the discipline towards potentially fertile terrain that was never, actually, that distant; challenges in that interdisciplinary raiding parties can often serve as pseudonyms for cannibalism, shallowness and dilettantism. This forum reviews the sociological turn in IR and interrogates it from a novel vantage point\u2014how sociologists themselves approach IR concepts, debates and issues. Three sociological approaches\u2014classical social theory, historical sociology and Foucauldian analysis\u2014are critically deployed to illuminate IR concerns. In this way, the forum offers the possibility of (re)establishing exchanges between the two disciplines premised on a firmer grasp of social theory itself. The result is a potentially more fruitful sociological turn, one with significant benefits for IR as a whole.",

Muitos te\u00f3ricos que se ocupam com teorias democr\u00e1ticas t\u00eam questionado as assun\u00e7\u00f5es b\u00e1sicas da teoria pol\u00edtica deliberativa que resulta da obra sobre Faktizit\u00e4t und Geltung (1992), apontando pontos fr\u00e1geis, sobre as implica\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e1ticas, possibilidades de efetividade, entre outros. Embora n\u00e3o seja poss\u00edvel acompanhar em toda sua amplitude a bibliografia cr\u00edtica sobre o tema, para nossos prop\u00f3sitos, vamos aqui nos limitar a apresentar alguns coment\u00e1rios acerca das controv\u00e9rsias envolvendo as concep\u00e7\u00f5es de esfera p\u00fablica e democracia deliberativa que resultam da obra sobre direito e democracia; quest\u00f5es que se tornaram problem\u00e1ticas para a literatura e que poderiam ser melhor investigadas.",

      "abstract": "O artigo discute os impasses e as alternativas para a representa\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica, tomando como ponto de partida a pol\u00eamica sobre o conceito de poder, travada nos anos de 1960 e 1970 na ci\u00eancia pol\u00edtica anglo-sax\u00e3 e envolvendo, notadamente, Robert Dahl, Bachrach, Baratz e Steven Lukes. De acordo com o \u00faltimo, a compreens\u00e3o do poder deve levar em conta tr\u00eas dimens\u00f5es: 1) a capacidade de tomar decis\u00f5es ou de vet\u00e1-las; 2) o controle sobre a agenda, isto \u00e9, a determina\u00e7\u00e3o das quest\u00f5es que ser\u00e3o alvo de decis\u00e3o; e 3) a capacidade de anular o conflito social, impedindo que indiv\u00edduos e grupos sociais tomem consci\u00eancia de seus verdadeiros interesses. Apesar dos problemas presentes nessa formula\u00e7\u00e3o, ela \u00e9 \u00fatil para pensar a representa\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica. As teorias predominantes levam em considera\u00e7\u00e3o apenas a face mais evidente da representa\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica, a escolha daqueles que tomar\u00e3o as decis\u00f5es. Mas uma democracia representativa mais pr\u00f3xima do ideal de soberania popular deveria contemplar a segunda dimens\u00e3o a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da agenda, hoje fortemente determinada pelos meios de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o de massa. Portanto, cabe entender a m\u00eddia como sendo tamb\u00e9m um espa\u00e7o de representa\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica. E o reconhecimento da terceira dimens\u00e3o implica a necessidade de gera\u00e7\u00e3o de espa\u00e7os que permitam aos grupos subalternos formularem autonomamente seus interesses, isto \u00e9, de uma sociedade civil desenvolvida e plural.",

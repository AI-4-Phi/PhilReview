      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Best practices in civic education emphasize deliberative pedagogies as one of the most powerful ways to educate enlightened democratic citizens. Yet deliberative pedagogies are rooted in a white normative ideal of discursive democracy that, in the service of \u201ccivility\u201d and \u201creasoned discourse,\u201d fails to account for the social and political inequalities\u2014the logic of white supremacy\u2014that structures our political context. Drawing on Critical Race Theory and Charles Mills\u2019s notion of the racial contract, I propose a pedagogy of counternarration that privileges voices from the margins, imagines the world as it could be, and talks back to dominant narratives in order to cultivate justice-oriented citizens in the democratic classroom.",

      "abstract": "This essay argues that Charles Mills\u2019s normative vision for racial justice\u2014a reformed, race-attentive liberalism\u2014is fundamentally self-undermining because it embraces the liberal property form. Specifically, I show how Mills\u2019s insistence on the practical utility of the property form for racial justice ignores both W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s signal warning about the reactionary power of propertied interests and how the hegemony of Lockean liberalism is a key mediator of racial/colonial domination in the United States. The essay first shows how Mills\u2019s anti-racist, social democratic liberalism relies on and legitimizes a property rights framework. I then analyze Du Bois\u2019s critique of liberal abolition-democracy during Reconstruction, surfacing how white propertied interests constantly threaten progressive gains and social democratic change. Building on Du Bois, I argue that Mills\u2019s reformed liberalism, by preserving the property form, places racial justice on an inherently unstable foundation while also excluding struggles for Indigenous sovereignty. Finally, I question Mills\u2019s pragmatic argument for restricting racial justice to a reformed liberalism. Mills\u2019s \u201cBlack radical liberalism\u201d is not as straightforwardly practical as he suggests because of the deep historical hold of Lockean, rather than Kantian, liberalism. Here, I excavate how hegemony around Lockean liberalism in the United States has been periodically reconsolidated, looking at the interwar and Cold War context as well as the deeper influence of Locke on US constitutionalism. Ultimately, against a politics that restricts racial justice to a social democratic horizon, I contend that it is necessary to challenge the liberal property form in the pursuit of racial justice and Indigenous sovereignty.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:The social uprisings in the United States during the summer of 2020 renewed public discussion of forms of domination embedded into the social contracts of Western democracies. These discussions echo insights from within political philosophy regarding the domination contract. Despite numerous attempts to shed light on myriad aspects of the domination contract, an analysis of the role of colonialism and coloniality has yet to be sufficiently engaged by political philosophers, particularly within social contract theory. Drawing on the frameworks of intersectionality and decolonial feminism, this article examines the interweavings between two prominent domination contracts, the racia-sexual contract and the colonial contract, to better account for the systematic exclusion of Black, Indigenous, and other women of color (BIWOC) from liberal social contracts that are foundationally predicated on forms of gendered, racialized, colonial domination.",

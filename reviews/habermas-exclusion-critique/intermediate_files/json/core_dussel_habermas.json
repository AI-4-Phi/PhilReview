      "abstract": "Transmodernity is a new philosophical paradigm that transcends the modern foundational ethos and as well differs from the postmodern critique. It is basically a call towards a just social order that gives priority to human life. It is inherently ethical and fundamentally liberational. This work looks into the insufficiency of Modern Ethiopian establishment in attaining an inclusive and pluralist arrangement. It assumes this establishment as a hegemonic totality that marginalizes its others. It argues that the Modern Ethiopian establishment is an ontologic totality that needs to be liberated and transformed. Based on Dussel\u2019s Philosophy and Ethics of Liberation, Transmodern Ethiopia is anticipated as an entity that could transcend the Modern and come up with a different arrangement. This would be an ethical arrangement which accepts the other as other. The three principles of Ethics of Liberation (material principle, formal principle and feasibility principle) are used as an ethical framework for the construction.Key words: Transmodernity, Liberation philosophy, Analectic, Ethics of Liberation, Modern Ethiopia, Transmodern Ethiopia, Pluriversal polylogu",

While post-Marxism seeks to rehabilitate a universal foundation for the construction of truth claims\u2014a universal already formed within Western modernity\u2014the decolonial critique seeks to dismantle all universals connected to the myths of modernity and therefore demands a departure from the standpoint of the cultural periphery. In fact, Alain Badiou and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, like other post-Marxists, have been rather critical of the standpoints articulated by decolonialists who strive to include cultural differences and marginalised identities in the process of knowledge production, but the reality is that the decolonial critique, more so than post-Marxism, is well-supported by the historical evidence, thus demonstrating the need for Enrique Dussel calls a \u2018transmodern pluriverse\u2019 in the academic world. In pursuit of diffusing this tension between the post-Marxists and the decolonialists, this article calls for further investigation in terms of determining if real dialogue is possible between these two trajectories of thought",

      "abstract": "Enrique Dussel's philosophy of liberation did not systematically and thoroughly address law in his work, as it did ethics, politics, or economics. However, he did devote some reflections and articles to it throughout his work. In this sense, the present text undertakes the task of articulating what would be a \"new law of liberation\" or \"transmodern law\" within the theory of the three constellations of political transformation that Dussel theorized in his Pol\u00edtica de la liberaci\u00f3n III (Politics of Liberation III), published in 2022. In this way, law is incorporated into his political philosophy, while also being articulated with the three normative ethical principles, specifically, the material, the formal or procedural legitimacy, and feasibility. It also raises some of the demands that law should assume and fulfill for the future, whether it be for political constellation number 3 or the so-called future intercultural and diverse transmodernity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La Filosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n de Enrique Dussel no hizo en su obra un tratamiento sistem\u00e1tico y profundo del derecho, tal como si lo hizo de la \u00e9tica, la pol\u00edtica o de la econom\u00eda. Sin embargo, dedic\u00f3 a lo largo de su obra algunas reflexiones y art\u00edculos sobre el mismo. En ese sentido, el presente texto asume la tarea de articular lo que ser\u00eda un \u201cnuevo derecho de la liberaci\u00f3n\u201d o \u201cderecho transmoderno\u201d al interior de la teor\u00eda de las tres constelaciones de la transformaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica que teoriz\u00f3 Dussel en su Pol\u00edtica de la liberaci\u00f3n III, publicada en el a\u00f1o 2022.

Tambi\u00e9n se plantean algunas de las exigencias que deber\u00eda asumir y cumplir un derecho para los tiempos futuros, ya sea para la constelaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica n\u00famero 3 o la llamada futura transmodernidad intercultural y diversa.\u00a0",

It challenges the Eurocentric periodization of history, emphasizing the erasure and misrepresentation of non-European civilizations in the global narrative. By examining the ideological constructs underpinning modernity, capitalism, and colonialism, the essay advocates for a pluriversal approach to knowledge and cultural traditions. It also critiques the inadequacies of postmodernism in addressing systemic inequities, proposing transmodernity as a framework for integrating diverse traditions and fostering dialogue among cultures of the Global South.

In this essay, we explore how critical theorists across three generations in the European Frankfurt School tradition articulated the \u2018struggles and wishes\u2019 of their age and place, and reflect on the contextual limits and enduring relevance of their negative, utopian, democratic and ethical methods. We then turn to developments of this work in the Latin American tradition, particularly as elaborated by feminists, which articulate critical theorizing as a transformative praxis within the material construction of dignified communitarian life. In the final part of the paper, we consider what we might learn about how to theorize our own dominations and liberations through this critical methodology",

Of particular importance to this research is the role that political borders play in shaping individuals\u2019 relationship to structures and practices of democracy. Following insights of decolonial and communication ethics scholars, this work understands the importance of ethically framing deliberations surrounding physical, metaphorical, and categorical political borders. Five chapters make up this work in the culmination of analyzing political gerrymandering as a form of democratic competition grounded in the rhetoric of colonialism. Tracing the colonial history of borders throughout American democracy provides this project the ground to discuss the evolution of challenges that gerrymandering has presented for democratic ethics. The aim of this research is to call attention to the hidden competitive forces that political borders have justified throughout the vast history of colonialism in America. The project does not conclude by calling for a deconstruction of borders, but rather a stronger understanding of the responsibilities that borders create in political society. Through decolonial border thinking and communication ethics, this work can show the necessary frameworks that democracy requires and to shine a light on how the manipulation of borders can corrupt the democratic ethics of public discourse",

We complement Maldonado-Torres\u2019s account of the decolonial turn in philosophy, theory and critique by providing an analysis of the trajectories of academic philosophy and clarifying the relevance of decolonising philosophy and of the decolonial turn for current efforts in transforming philosophy in face of the challenges of social movements such as the Third World Liberation Front and Black Lives Matter in the United States, and Rhodes Must Fall in South Africa and England. After a brief analysis of the trajectory and current status of philosophy as a discipline in the modern Western research university, we provide examples of the decolonial turn and of decolonising philosophy in three areas: the engagement with (1) Asian and (2) Latin American philosophies, and (3) debates in the philosophy of race and gender",

This is to be accomplished through a conceptual analysis of Habermas\u2019s defense of modernity against the postmodernism of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault as elaborated in Habermas\u2019s work The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Through such an analysis, I will argue for the following points. (1) Habermas\u2019s discourse of modernity provides better accounts of responsibility and emancipation compared to the postmodernism of Derrida and Foucault. (2) Still,\u00a0 Habermas\u2019s discourse of modernity fails to fully address asymmetrical power relations and (3)\u00a0 Habermas\u2019s modernity is Eurocentric in failing to fully deconstruct the Eurocentric tendencies of the philosophical tradition of which it\u2019s a part",

Decolonial perspectives give rise to an ethics that is fundamentally global but distinct from, and critical of, moral cosmopolitanism. Decolonial ethics shares with cosmopolitanism a refusal to circumscribe normative commitments on the basis of existing political and cultural boundaries. It differs from cosmopolitanism, though, by virtue of its rejection of the individualism and universalism of cosmopolitan thought. Where cosmopolitan approaches tend to articulate abstract principles developed from within a particular Western tradition, decolonial approaches reject abstract global designs in favour of inter-cultural dialogue amongst multiple people(s), including peoples who deem collective and non-human entities to be of fundamental moral importance. In addition, decolonial global ethics rejects universality in favour of \u2018pluriversality\u2019",

Leiblichkeit spielt hier insofern eine entscheidende Rolle, als die Bedeutungslosigkeit oder der Drang zur \u00dcberwindung des eigenen K\u00f6rpers in den gedanklichen Systemen von Descartes, Kant oder Hegel zu einer selbstreferentiellen Falle, einer ethischen Blindheit oder einer Vormachtstellung der Idee \u00fcber den konkreten Menschen f\u00fchrt. Bei Marx ortet Dussel bereits einen Aufbruch hinsichtlich eines neuen ethischen Verst\u00e4ndnisses und einer radikalen Kritik am Hegelschen Weltverst\u00e4ndnis, durch L\u00e9vinas gelingt ihm dann auch der methodische Durchbruch zu einem neu gedachten ethischen Subjekt.\n\nDer Begriff des Systems beschreibt die Kontextualit\u00e4t des Dusselschen Subjekts als sein wesentliches Bestimmungsmerkmal. Subjekt-Sein bedeutet, Teil eines bestimmtes Systems zu sein, sowohl im Sinne der Selbstverortung als auch der Zuschreibung. Da Systeme auf der Basis von Ausschluss funktionieren und somit immer \"Opfer produzieren\", stellen sie aufgrund dieser immanenten Ungerechtigkeit auch den hermeneutischen Ort des Subjekts in der Befreiungsethik dar. Dussels Systemanalysen werden im dritten Teil am Beispiel seiner Kolonialismus- und Eurozentrismuskritik veranschaulicht. \n\nIm vierten Teil werden die vorangegangen \u00dcberlegungen mit Dussels Konzept der Transmoderne zusammengef\u00fchrt. Die Transmoderne erkl\u00e4rt nun als Ort des befreiungsethischen Subjekts den Unterschied zwischem dem Subjekt der Befreiungsethik, n\u00e4mlich die/der Unterdr\u00fcckteN, und dem befreiungsethischen Subjekt als von der Befreiungsethik angeleiteten Menschen. \n\nDas Subjekt bei Dussel ist also einerseits in individueller Hinsicht als Aufgabe f\u00fcr den je eigenen Lebensvollzug zu interpretieren. Andererseits identifiziert er den/die Arme und Unterdr\u00fcckteN als konkretes Subjekt der Befreiungsethik",

      "abstract": "The rise of the radical right in the context of neoliberal capitalism within an era of decolonization and the new age of empire has been triggered by revisionisms supporting the radicalization of North-South coloniality on a global scale denied by history. In this context, we investigate the absence of Latin America when interrogating the historiography of Unilever, one of the most important in the field of business history (BH). We also seek to overcome this absence in BH through a transmodern decolonial approach from the perspective of the majority of the population living \u201chistories others,\u201d which promotes an innovative South-North dialogue between the Euro-British and the decolonial historic turns in management and organization studies (MOS). We developed a decolonial practical perspective of historiographic investigation to overcome the pattern of conformist plurality in the North toward liberating transmodernity in both the South and North. The research suggests that the historiography of Unilever embodies an ambivalent pattern of historicization ignored by both the Euro-British and the decolonial historic turns. We argue that inter-imperial dynamics and radicalization inform the institutionalization of BH by the Anglo-American world as a post-imperial turn of North-South binarism championed by the field of imperial history. With implications for research and teaching in BH and MOS, we conclude that transmodern dialogues from the perspective of a growing population living colonialism-imperialism presents enable the renewal of solidary decolonial struggles in the South and North against inter-imperial dynamics of silencing and appropriating-limiting \u201chistories others\u201d also lived by scholars.El ascenso de la derecha radical en el contexto del capitalismo neoliberal en una era de descolonizaci\u00f3n e imperio ha sido impulsado por revisionismos historiogr\u00e1ficos que informan la radicalizaci\u00f3n a escala global de la colonialidad Norte-Sur negada por la historia. En este contexto, investigamos la negaci\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina por parte de la historiograf\u00eda de Unilever (HU) coproducida por el \u00e1rea de business history (BH). El objetivo es investigar la negaci\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina en HU y buscar superar esta situaci\u00f3n en la BH, a trav\u00e9s de un enfoque decolonial transmoderno comprometido con la mayor\u00eda que vive \u201chistorias otras\u201d que promueva un di\u00e1logo innovador Sur-Norte entre los giros hist\u00f3ricos euro-brit\u00e1nico y decolonial latinoamericano en estudios organizacionales y de gesti\u00f3n (EOG). Como metodolog\u00eda, desarrollamos una perspectiva de praxis decolonial de investigaci\u00f3n historiogr\u00e1fica con el objetivo de ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del patr\u00f3n de pluralidad conformista en el Norte, hacia la transmodernidad liberadora en el Sur y el Norte. La investigaci\u00f3n sugiere que HU incorpora un patr\u00f3n ambivalente de historizaci\u00f3n que es ignorado por ambos virajes hist\u00f3ricos. Argumentamos que la institucionalizaci\u00f3n del campo de BH por parte del mundo angloamericano como un giro posimperial se fundamenta en la din\u00e1mica interimperial y la radicalizaci\u00f3n del binarismo Norte-Sur liderada por el \u00e1rea de la historia imperial. Con implicaciones para la investigaci\u00f3n y la ense\u00f1anza de BH y EOG, concluimos que los di\u00e1logos transmodernos comprometidos con una creciente poblaci\u00f3n que vive en los presentes colonial-imperial permiten la renovaci\u00f3n de las luchas decoloniales solidarias en el Sur y el Norte contra las din\u00e1micas interimperiales de negaci\u00f3n y apropiaci\u00f3n-contenci\u00f3n de \u201chistorias otras\u201d vividas tambi\u00e9n por acad\u00e9micos.A ascens\u00e3o da direita radical no contexto do capitalismo neoliberal numa era de descoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e imp\u00e9rio vem sendo impulsionada por revisionismos historiogr\u00e1ficos que informam a radicaliza\u00e7\u00e3o em escala global da colonialidade Norte-Sul negada pela hist\u00f3ria.

Como metodologia desenvolvemos uma perspectiva decolonial pr\u00e1xica de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o historiogr\u00e1fica visando ir al\u00e9m do padr\u00e3o de pluralidade conformista no Norte, rumo \u00e0 transmodernidade libertadora no Sul e no Norte.

Objetivamos demonstrar a Transmodernidade enquanto alternativa \u00e9tica e pol\u00edtica, baseada no di\u00e1logo transcultural, na supera\u00e7\u00e3o da colonialidade e na centralidade da \u00e9tica da liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, analisando-a como um projeto capaz de superar as falhas das narrativas modernas e p\u00f3s-modernas, destacando sua relev\u00e2ncia para a descoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o do saber e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de alternativas globais inclusivas. Para tanto, conduzimos esta pesquisa a partir de uma metodologia qualitativa e bibliogr\u00e1fica com an\u00e1lise te\u00f3rica das obras de Dussel e de interlocutores no campo da filosofia da liberta\u00e7\u00e3o e da teoria decolonial, al\u00e9m de uma abordagem hist\u00f3rica para contextualizar o sistema-mundo moderno/colonial, bem como nos utilizamos, prioritariamente, do aporte te\u00f3rico de Zygmunt Bauman para discorrermos acerca da P\u00f3s-modernidade. Os resultados de nossas pesquisas indicam que a Transmodernidade oferece uma base s\u00f3lida para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um mundo mais justo e plural, ao valorizar as vozes subalternas e descolonizar epistemologias. Ela prop\u00f5e uma reinterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de valores modernos como ci\u00eancia e direitos humanos, incorporando perspectivas pluriversais. Assim, o projeto transmoderno surge como uma resposta transformadora \u00e0s crises globais contempor\u00e2neas, promovendo justi\u00e7a social, di\u00e1logo transcultural e sustentabilidade; sendo um passo adiante a P\u00f3s-modernidade na supera\u00e7\u00e3o da Modernidade euroc\u00eantrica colonial",

      "abstract": "This dissertation examines moral visions of the political economy of mainstream Christian social ethics through a liberationist and postcolonial analysis of the work of three leading political economic ethicists, Daniel Finn, Max Stackhouse, and Philip Wogaman. Constrained by their subject position within modernity/coloniality and a commitment to a neoclassical understanding of the political economy, mainstream Christian ethicists have stopped short of condemning the inextricable complicity of the capitalist political economy to colonialism and its racist, patriarchal, and oppressive power relations. This dissertation argues that the moral visions of mainstream Christian social ethicists must be decolonized and points to Latina/o thinking and heterodox economic thought as two starting points for such a decolonization of the moral imaginary.\nThe project makes contributions to both Christian social ethics and Latina/o religious cultural studies. It contributes to Christian social ethics by examining the underlying commitment to neoclassical economic thought of mainstream Christian social ethics, deploying postcolonial hermeneutics to construct ethical frameworks that move beyond collusion with colonialism and complicity with empire, and offering a more careful analysis of political economy than is generally found within the liberationist strand of Christian social ethics. In applying the insights of Latina/o thinking to political economic ethics, it contributes to Latina/o religious cultural studies by moving beyond the stagnated discussions of identity politics, self-determination, and minority rights. It also contributes to the field by empowering Latina/o religious cultural scholars to engage in non-capitalist economic theorizing by providing new analytical tools to combat the hegemonic conceptualization of capitalism as co-terminus with the political economy.\nMainstream Christian moral visions of the political economy must be decolonized to remain Christian and moral. Christian social ethics must draw on economic analyses that acknowledge the exploitative record of capitalism and its inextricable complicity with the modern/colonial complex. It must also avoid the hegemonic suppression of subjugated knowledges by theorizing from multiple places at once, taking on a subaltern perspective in addition to its unavoidably modern/colonial perspective",

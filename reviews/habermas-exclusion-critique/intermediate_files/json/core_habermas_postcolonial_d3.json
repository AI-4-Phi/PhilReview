      "abstract": "Sociology is usually represented as having emerged alongside European modernity. The latter is frequently understood as sociology's special object with sociology itself a distinctively modern form of explanation. The period of sociology's disciplinary formation was also the heyday of European colonialism, yet the colonial relationship did not figure in the development of sociological understandings. While the recent emergence of postcolonialism appears to have initiated a reconsideration of understandings of modernity, with the development of theories of multiple modernities, I suggest that this engagement is more an attempt at recuperating the transformative aspect of postcolonialism than engaging with its critiques. In setting out the challenge of postcolonialism to dominant sociological accounts, I also address `missing feminist/queer revolutions', suggesting that by engaging with postcolonialism there is the potential to transform sociological understandings by opening up a dialogue beyond the simple pluralism of identity claims",

      "abstract": "International audienceI have felt moved to write this piece for two reasons. First, the episode I will recount below resonates strongly with my experience and that of other non-European colleagues (those I have been discussing with, at least) regarding the politics of academic knowledge production in Western academic contexts. Second, it exemplifies what in my view is a rather problematic understanding of \" Eurocentrism \" and \" theory \" , reducing the former to an unproductive polemical register, and confusing the latter with a user's manual. The episode consists of me being called \" Eurocentric \" in an academic workshop, although this piece is in no way intended as a response to my accusers. Rather, it is written in the spirit of addressing the issues identified above, which I take to be of political, theoretical and pedagogic significance. What, then, was my sin to deserve this academic and political kiss of death? I was surprised\u2014stunned even\u2014especially because I had taken good care to start with a disclaimer that my paper was informed by the French context and inspired by a particular French thinker. Since the previous day of the workshop had seen numerous remarks of the type \" Yes, but this doesn't work in Sri Lanka! \" (there was a contingent of anthropologists and development geographers with ongoing research projects there), I was careful, running the risk of sounding defensive, to also emphasize that my paper offered one among many possible ways of thinking about the relationship between space and politics, one of the workshop themes. Alas, it didn't work in Sri Lanka! Although I tried to explain that my paper was neither inspired by nor responding to the situation in Sri Lanka, I, the only non-European present, ended up being the only Eurocentric of the whole workshop. The problem, according to my interlocutors, was that my alleged \" model \" (a term I had deliberately avoided) either \" did not work in \" or \" did not apply to \" Sri Lanka (Pakistan, if I remember correctly, was also mentioned). It is this kind of use of the term that I find unproductive and problematic. Based on a strictly geographical or even cartographica",

Its proponents focus on the canon\u2019s implicit claim, namely that only one social group is able to think thoroughly and accurately about all problems of philosophical significance across varying spatiotemporal contexts. In this short article, I will use two different debates to make some aspects of this call more meaningful: the US-American discourse in academic philosophy on deracializing the knowing subject and the post-Holocaust German understanding of public intellectual spaces (sections 2 and 3 respectively)",

      "abstract": "The article deals with postcolonial works in the field of development theory and policy beyond the widely discussed post-development approaches. After identifying four analytical strategies typical for postcolonial studies, it examines the works in question. Particular attention is given to the criticism that postcolonial works would neglect material practices. The article concludes that for many works this criticism is not justified, but that the empirical engagement of postcolonial approaches with institutions and processes in development policy is often inaccurate, superficial and incomplete. 'Development studies does not tend to listen to subalterns and postcolonial studies does not tend to concern itself with whether the subaltern is eating' (Sylvester 1999: 703). Christine Sylvester's well-known characterisation of the relationship between development studies and postcolonial studies may be somewhat exaggerated, it is, however, based on a sharp observation. This relationship also constitutes the topic of this article. The article's objective is twofold: on the one hand it aims to provide a - far from exhaustive - survey of works from the area of postcolonial studies that deal with 'development'. Usually this type of work is associated with the post-development school, which has been widely discussed by now, but here the focus is on other authors beyond post-development. On the other hand, the article will deal with one of the central points of criticism which has been raised against postcolonial studies: that they neglect material practices. This criticism shall be examined on the grounds of the postcolonial works in the field of 'development'. For a start, it needs to be clarified what is meant by postcolonial studies and by 'development' - and why the concept is placed in quotation marks. Therefore the first section of the article deals (very briefly) with the concept of development and the second one (equally superficially) with the field of postcolonial studies. In the latter, specifically postcolonial questions and strategies of analysis will be examined, in order to achieve some orientation faced with the multitude of works and approaches in this field. Subsequently the focus will be on the relationship between development studies and postcolonial studies. Regarding the accusation of neglecting material practices and the strategies identified beforehand, a number of postcolonial works in the area of 'development' theory and policy will be scrutinized",

      "abstract": "This article offers a theory of the notion \u2018reference culture\u2019 by taking as major examples modernity and Europe. Both constitute reference cultures and while different are closely related. A certain entanglement took place between the emergence of modernity and the formation of European culture whereby the latter came to be one of the main carriers of modernity. However, they need to be separated in that Europe, while being the first major expression of modernity, is not the only embodiment of modernity. Modernity can be termed a first-order reference culture and Europe a second-order one. While there have been many second-order reference cultures, the European one was an influential and powerful one, but it was also a temporary one. This article sets out the main features that define the specificity of Europe. Against accounts that emphasize a master narrative or an underlying cultural unity to Europe, it is argued that crucial to the making of Europe was the formation of modes of communication that enabled common practices to develop across a range of different cultures. In this way, it is argued, Europe consolidated as a consequence less of endogenous factors than exogenous ones. Important, too, was the mobile nature of European culture which facilitated translation into other cultures and which was also receptive to modernity. The twentieth century has witnessed the emergence of other varieties of modernity and the global decline of the European mode",

Whether couched in terms of postcolonialism, multiculturalism, genealogy, global understanding, political theology, or the revival of normative, metaphysical and openly religious perspectives, today\u2019s postsecular and even anti-secular mood in social theory seems to consign Gellner\u2019s project to the dustbin of history: a stern but doomed attempt to shore up western liberal rationalism. Under some revisionary lights, it has even become pointless to distinguish flexible secular thinking which still retains some firm \u2018bottom lines\u2019 from what is routinely portrayed as rampant ideological secularism. Unconvinced by key assumptions and motivations on this terrain, I reactivate Gellner\u2019s essential concerns and propositions around secularity and secularism, feeding these into the current debates. Whilst Gellner\u2019s stringent, unrivalled exposure of intellectual cant continues to be hugely valuable, and his sense of the utter historicity of social life and thought indispensable, Gellner\u2019s critical positivism could not, by his own admission, produce a coherent cultural politics.</jats:p",

En segundo\r\nlugar, estoy convencido de que el potencial\r\nde la Ilustraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 lejos de agotarse hoy\r\nen d\u00eda.

Secondly, it is my contention that\r\nthe potential of Enlightenment has not yet\r\nbeen exhausted. Thirdly, I understand Enlightenment\r\nas a \u201ccritical cultural practice\u201d\r\nthat prepares us in a very particular way for\r\nthe global entanglement of human affairs\r\nbecause it pushes us, time and again, to examine\r\nour own cultures criticall",

      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of his death, a number of excellent articles were written that each provide a different door into the vast room of Bauman\u2019s sociology. In the past year or so, there have also been a number of books that have set about providing a more \u2018critical analysis\u2019 of his work whilst also considering how sociology might look anew and move creatively \u2018beyond Bauman\u2019 (Blackshaw 2016; Jacobsen ed. 2016; Rattansi 2017). In so doing, these welcome contributions clearly take Bauman\u2019s sociological imagination very seriously and provide useful reference points for both scholars and students seeking a more robust examination of Bauman\u2019s ideas. Each contribution deserves to be read and studied as they provide new and considered insights into Bauman\u2019s legacy for the social sciences and humanities. Throughout the article that follows, we  make our own contribution to the curious reader\u2019s deliberations on these debates by shining a light on those aspects of Bauman\u2019s work that may have become somewhat hidden and possibly overlooked in what we see as a growing tendency to focus primarily upon his later writings on \u2018liquid modernity\u2019. We argue that in order to grasp fully the meaning of Bauman\u2019s writing in the more popular post-2000 phase, it is vital that one understands these earlier foundations of his thought. In this way, we hope that we may go some way to rebalancing the concerns of some contemporary critics",

      "abstract": "Urban studies today is marked by many active debates. In an earlier paper, we addressed some of these debates by proposing a foundational concept of urbanization and urban form as a way of identifying a common language for urban research. In the present paper we provide a brief recapitulation of that framework. We then use this preliminary material as background to a critique of three currently influential versions of urban analysis, namely, postcolonial urban theory, assemblage theoretic approaches, and planetary urbanism. We evaluate each of these versions in turn and find them seriously wanting as statements about urban realities. We criticize (a) postcolonial urban theory for its particularism and its insistence on the provincialization of knowledge, (b) assemblage theoretic approaches for their indeterminacy and eclecticism, and (c) planetary urbanism for its radical devaluation of the forces of agglomeration and nodality in urban-economic geography",

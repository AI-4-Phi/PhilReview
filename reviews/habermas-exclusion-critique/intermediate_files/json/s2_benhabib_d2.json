To this end, we draw on Seyla Benhabib\u2019s (Critique, norm and utopia: a study of the foundations of critical theory. Columbia University Press, New York, 1986) re-articulation of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s notion of critique to ascertain how the practice of academic activism ought to be amended. According to Benhabib (Critique, norm and utopia: a study of the foundations of critical theory. Columbia University Press, New York, 1986: 279), Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action is a justifiable form of critique as it re-establishes the relation between self -reflection and autonomy and it explains autonomy in communicative terms, that is, autonomy is not synonymous with self-legislation or self-actualisation or mimesis, but rather \u2018the cognitive competence to adopt to a universalist standpoint and the interactive competence to act on such a basis\u2019 (Benhabib, Critique, norm and utopia: a study of the foundations of critical theory. Columbia University Press, New York, 1986: 282). In relation to the notions of self -reflective autonomy and communicative autonomy, we examine what a philosophy of higher education looks like and what the implications of such a form of critique hold for academic activism.",

The guiding question of the essay is: does the transition proposed by Habermas from other rationality types to the communicative concern an interparadigmatic theory or a paradigmatic leap? Methodologically, we adopted the conception of an essay according to which authors and readers need to recognize that reality can be understood in different ways. The discussion, contextualized in public administration, allowed us to understand that considering the communicative action theory as having an interparadigmatic character does not mean it is a mere gathering of other theories because it surpasses those it dialogues with, additionally presenting a radical shift. We propose that the Communicative action theory comprises a paradigmatic leap with interparadigmatic characteristics. Finally, we present implications of this discussion for Public Administration.",

      "abstract": "Since the publication of Between Facts and Norms, Habermas\u2019s concept of communicative power has been the topic of significant discussion. This article contributes to this conversation by examining Habermas\u2019s account of what makes communication powerful. I argue that Habermas\u2019s conception of communicative power describes a nonviolent and noninstrumental mode of acting and being with others in language. This mode of engagement underwrites a conception of power that is structurally different from willing, one that builds meaningful worlds and (trans-)forms those engaging in communicative procedures. In drawing out this aspect of Habermas\u2019s conception, I show that he is not a rationalist and proceduralist whose account of communicative procedures protects decision-making from irrational aesthetic powers. Rather, he presents communication as a mimetic achievement, a set of aesthetic practices and experiences that affectively alter its participants. With this position, Habermas makes an important contribution to and not just against the analysis of the aesthetic dimensions of political life. In casting communication as a mimetic achievement, Habermas presents an account of how communication opens worlds and forms subjects. Yet since these aspects of communication arrive in linguistic form, he can also examine affective and aesthetic experiences within discursive procedures. We can understand world-opening and aesthetic (trans-)formation as an essential part of democratic politics while also identifying the perspectives and resources by which actors can reflect on and critically evaluate whether an opinion is justified or whether a political project is worth pursuing.",

The main principle of \u200ethe Pancasila-style democracy is deliberation to reach a consensus based on noble knowledge \u200eand wisdom. This principle of deliberation is in line with Habermas's thesis of communicative \u200eaction but also has different implications. This paper compares the concept of deliberation-\u200econsensus ala Pancasila and Habermas's communicative action in implementing a democratic \u200esystem. This qualitative research analyzes data that includes historical literature, philosophy, and \u200escientific articles that discuss discourses related to Pancasila and Habermas's theory of \u200ecommunicative action. The study results show differences in Eastern and Western culture in the \u200etwo discourses. In Pancasila deliberation and consensus, communal ties are very strong, while \u200ethe value of Western individualism in rationalizing a discourse becomes the color of Habermas' \u200etheory.\u200e",

We work specifically with one of the theoretical strands that contemplate sociomateriality - New Materialism based on Barad - and with the most recurrent Habermasian concepts, such as communicative action, the public sphere, worlds of life, and the system. We identify that Habermas\u2019 theoretical work is open to dialogue with the sociomaterial perspective and outline a framework highlighting the main points of convergence and divergence between Habermas and Barad\u2019s proposals, specifying the possibilities for integration. Overall, the analyses argue that it is possible to incorporate sociomaterial perspectives into empirical studies involving the Theory of Communicative Action and the main related ideas.",

Three functions of communication within Habermas\u2019s framework form the core of my approach, situating him in close proximity to the pragmatic philosophical tradition. In conclusion, I draw on Axel Honneth\u2019s reading of John Dewey\u2019s theory of democracy to underscore Habermas\u2019s relevance for contemporary discussions on pragmatism and democracy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \nHabermas\u2019s theory of communicative action is highly relevant as a philosophical foundation for upholding human rights, emphasizing the intrinsic value of each individual, which must not be eliminated by any power. This is supported by Article 6 paragraph (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified as Law Number 12 of 2005. Critical theory, a school of philosophy, focuses on liberating human knowledge from transcendental and empirical oppression, critiquing ideologies that perpetuate social oppression. Human rights have become a dynamic issue in Indonesia, especially during the Presidential Election, with widespread discussions at national and international levels. Countries, organizations, and individuals are increasingly voicing concerns about human rights issues. These problems are complex, particularly in resolving and sanctioning perpetrators, leading some to view human rights as \u201cmerely theoretical.\u201d Applying critical theory is crucial in this context, as perfected by J\u00fcrgen Habermas. This research employs normative methods, including statutory, conceptual, and case approaches. It concludes that J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action and John Locke\u2019s natural law are similar, emphasizing the inherent meaning of external rights. This grounding makes Habermas\u2019s theory important for upholding law and human rights internationally, although its implementation remains ambiguous. \nAbstrak \nTeori kritis tindakan komunikatif Habermas sangat relevan sebagai fondasi filosofis penegakan HAM yang menekankan nilai intrinsik setiap individu, yang tidak boleh dihilangkan oleh kekuasaan mana pun, sesuai dengan Pasal 6 ayat (1) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights yang diratifikasi menjadi Undang-Undang Nomor 12 Tahun 2005. Teori kritis adalah aliran filsafat tentang pembebasan pengetahuan manusia dari segala bentuk penindasan transendental dan empiris. Ide teori kritis adalah kritik terhadap ideologi yang bertujuanmenyadarkan manusia akan penindasan sosial dan mencoba membebaskannya. Isu HAM menjadi perbincangan dinamis di Indonesia, terutama pada saat pemilihan presiden, serta di dunia internasional. Berbagai negara, organisasi, dan individu menyuarakan sudut pandang HAM yang ada. Problematika HAM sulit diselesaikan dan penerapan sanksi bagi pelaku sering dianggap \u201cteorik belaka.\u201d Penerapan teori tindakan komunikatif ini penting terkait HAM karena disempurnakan oleh J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan, konseptual, dan kasus. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan adanya kesamaan konsep antara teori kritis J\u00fcrgen Habermas dan aliran hukum kodrat John Locke, yang menekankan hak-hak lahiriah. Teori J\u00fcrgen Habermas menjadi penting untuk penegakan hukum dan HAM di dunia internasional, meskipun penerapannya masih ambigu.",

      "abstract": "This study argues that the works of philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas can provide useful directions for mathematics education research on statistical literacy. Recent studies on the critical demands posed by statistical information in media highlight the importance of the communicative component of statistical literacy, which involves students\u2019 ability to react to statistical information. By adapting Habermas\u2019 construct of communicative rationality into a framework for statistical literacy, a novel analytical tool is presented that can provide theoretical insights as well as in-depth empirical insights into students\u2019 communication about statistical information. Central to the framework are the four validity claims of comprehensibility, truth, truthfulness, and rightness which interlocutors need to address to engage in statistical communication. The empirical usefulness of the framework is shown by presenting the results of a study that examined Grade 5 students\u2019 responses to fictional arguments about the decline of Arctic sea ice. The Habermas-based framework not only reveals that complex evaluations of statistical arguments can take place even in Grade 5 but also shows that students\u2019 evaluations vary greatly. Empirical results include a content-specific differentiation of validity claims through inductively identified sub-categories as well as a description of differences in the students\u2019 uses of validity claims.",

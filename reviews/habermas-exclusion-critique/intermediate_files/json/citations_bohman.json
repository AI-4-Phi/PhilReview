The distinction is not sharp but interesting nonetheless in that Hookway expands epistemic injustice to include practices where someone is treated as if they do not have the capacity even to ask interesting or important questions, prior even to their contributions being disregarded. In this way, people are treated not only as non-knowers but also as non-participants. Thus, Fricker (2007) suggests that societies (and in this case, education institutions) \u201ctrain\u201d our sensibilities in ways which are flawed, given the prejudices that already exist (and which constitute an element of conversion factors).",

These different models of democracy are then associated with the monitorial, facilitative, radical, and collaborative roles of the media, with each covering different requirements derived from different theoretical models of democracy. James Curran (2011, pp. 80-81) also ends up with a related categorization of liberal-pluralist, rational-choice, deliberative, and radical democracy, each of which is linked to different media regimes. In addition to these more or less established theoretical traditions, there is increasing attention to more media-centric notions such as digital democracy or e-democracy. For some, the enthusiasm about the possibility of digital media technology enhancing democracy is another signal that media studies has grown more inward-looking and media-centric, \u2018more concerned with justifying which media elements or processes were key, while bigger question of the media in society, which the debate had begun with, becomes less important\u2019 (Hesmondhalgh & Toynbee, 2008, p. 8). Lincoln Dahlberg (2011), however, notes that there are also very different understanding of the form and models of democracy that digital media may promote.",
            "Barber, 1984; Bohman, 2000; Dryzek, 2000). The prominence of Dewey and Walter Lippmann is also undoubtedly explained by the status of \u2018Dewey-Lippmann debate\u2019 as basic stuff of journalism textbooks, so references to these names does not necessarily indicate especially deep scrutiny of these theorists. Interestingly, other 20 century American theorists of democracy such as John Rawls and Robert Dahl have received much less attention. In terms of contemporary theorists, J\u00fcrgen Habermas is unsurprisingly a dominant figure. What is interesting is that aside from actual citations or articles that discuss his work in detail, the term \u2018Habermasian\u2019 seems to have become an expression that does not even need to be defined or explained. The term appears 454 times in the articles since 1990 (with 426 of those since 2000), which is more than any individual name and as a general identifier second only to \u2018Marxist\u2019 8 . This seems to suggest that especially in recent decades the term has gained an implicit meaning and can be used as a short-hand reference for things like rational discussion and the public sphere without even citing the relevant works. The status of Habermas as the main man of consecutive generations of media scholars is thus hardly in question, even if he may be used today more as an almost half-fictional reference point than as an actual discussion partner. Whether of not these references actually reflect the work of Habermas or if there are aspects that have been overlooked in media and communication studies is beyond the scope of this article (see Karppinen, Moe & Svensson, 2008). At least to some extent, however, this seems to reflect Hesmondhalgh and Toynbee\u2019s observations about the narrow uses of social theory. Hesmondhalgh and Toynbee (2008) argue that although various theorists have been mobilized in media and communication studies, only a single"

            "Obviously, however, participants engaged in these processes have different resources, capacities and opportunities to deliberate (Bohman, 1996; Maia, 2004; Young, 2000). Asymmetries of different sources tend to prevail, as certain individuals may have more chances and capacities to advocate their perspectives. As Bohman (1996, pp. 107\u2013149) highlights, deliberative inequalities, which include power asymmetries, communicative inequalities and political poverty, often obstruct deliberative practices. These inequalities prevent some individuals from being heard, thus creating communicative conditions under which the most powerful actors dominate. It is important to point out here that inequalities that pervade deliberative forums can emerge from two main manifestations of power.(1) The first one occurs when specific social actors aim to directly undermine the deliberative participation of other actors. Power acquires, here, a Weberian flavour since it reflects the capacity of an actor to impose its will upon others. An example of this form of power may be found in the effort of some civic associations to suffocate other associations that claim to represent the same constituents from different perspectives. This is not, however, the only way power manifests itself in the production of deliberative inequalities. Power undermines equality in more pervasive and subtle ways. As Bohman (1996, p. 116) argues, intimidation is \u2018\u2018not always explicit nor always intentional\u2019\u2019. Inequalities emerge even when actors willingly listen and give respectful R.F.

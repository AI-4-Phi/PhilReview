      "abstract": "In prediction-allocation problems, predictions are used to allocate social goods. Standard methodology recommends factoring these problems into two stages: first, individual outcomes are predicted as accurately as possible; second, allocations are made based on these predictions. But when predictions inform allocation, they causally influence outcomes. The \u201cperformative\u201d nature of these predictions entangles epistemic and pragmatic considerations, making notions of accuracy ambiguous. Two families of responses propose to correct the standard procedure. Emphasizing the epistemic, endogenization recommends making predictions that tend to make themselves true. Pragmatic encroachment recommends making the predictions with the best distributive consequences. We argue that both responses are misguided. The former undermines the normative goals of allocation. The latter, despite being instrumentally rational, has a distorting effect on communication. When predictions are expressions of substantive normative commitments, they cannot help resolve normative disputes among policymakers and street-level bureaucrats. That is, they are not communicatively rational. We argue that one does not have to trade off instrumental and communicative rationality and introduce two criteria of adequacy for predictions: they should be decision- and discourse-supportive. These criteria can be met by predicting counterfactual outcomes. We argue that predictions satisfying these criteria can serve as public reasons.",

      "abstract": "This paper reflects on the reception and application of Habermas\u2019 concept of the public sphere in media and communication studies at various points in recent history. It argues that it is urgent to focus the scholarly community\u2019s intellectual efforts not on decrying the utopian nature of the concept, but on salvaging and honing its normative edge. Its central philosophical kernel, rational-critical debate, and its connection to concepts such as communicative action, communicative rationality and deliberation developed in Habermas\u2019 later works, need to be re-examined and re-asserted as a vital criterion of democratic public communication. In defence of this argument, some of the most influential critiques of the public sphere model\u2014its alleged neglect of emotions and conflict\u2014are examined and challenged. The pathologies of the current space of mediatised public communication, it is argued, should be understood as symptoms of the erosion of communicative rationality and the ideal of the public sphere from the social imaginary.",

      "abstract": "This study argues that the works of philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas can provide useful directions for mathematics education research on statistical literacy. Recent studies on the critical demands posed by statistical information in media highlight the importance of the communicative component of statistical literacy, which involves students\u2019 ability to react to statistical information. By adapting Habermas\u2019 construct of communicative rationality into a framework for statistical literacy, a novel analytical tool is presented that can provide theoretical insights as well as in-depth empirical insights into students\u2019 communication about statistical information. Central to the framework are the four validity claims of comprehensibility, truth, truthfulness, and rightness which interlocutors need to address to engage in statistical communication. The empirical usefulness of the framework is shown by presenting the results of a study that examined Grade 5 students\u2019 responses to fictional arguments about the decline of Arctic sea ice. The Habermas-based framework not only reveals that complex evaluations of statistical arguments can take place even in Grade 5 but also shows that students\u2019 evaluations vary greatly. Empirical results include a content-specific differentiation of validity claims through inductively identified sub-categories as well as a description of differences in the students\u2019 uses of validity claims.",

Interestingly, the digital space is predominantly occupied by conservative and radical forms of Islam. In response, this study examines the strategies employed by moderate groups to promote religious moderation, particularly through the Islamic portal nu.or.id. This portal aims to provide reliable information about Nu-an and Islam. The study analyzes articles, concepts, and viewpoints published on the portal to evaluate their promotion of moderation. J\u00fcrgen Habermas' theory of communicative rationality is used to assess moderate tendencies, while essays on nu.or.id are evaluated based on truth, accuracy, and honesty. The study concludes that nu.or.id's efforts to promote religious moderation have a significant impact on filtering news content or thoughts that do not align with Islamic values. Writers consistently use logical and religious arguments to challenge the conservative-radical narrative of Islam. The strategy implemented by portals such as nu.or.id appears to resonate with middle-class Muslims, who are often targeted by fundamentalist groups. Therefore, targeting a general audience through nu.or.id is seen as a positive step.",

      "abstract": "he article aims to characterize the freedom of will of the employee and the employer when changing the employment contract from the perspective of communicative rationality. The author notes that the employee\u2019s labor process during the exercise of his right to work at the employer\u2019s enterprise, institution, or organization inevitably involves communication between the parties to the employment contract. Attention is focused on the development of legal regulation of relations with the realization of the right to work, which, with the development of society, was able to cover numerous collectives, uniting workers, and using work as a means of joint activity. It is proven that by being equal at the stage of concluding an employment contract and freely expressing their will, the employee and the employer do not lose this equality and this right to be in a legal relationship according to their will. This morality has acquired normativity thanks to the design of the modern content of the norm of Article 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine. It is concluded that the communication of the parties to the employment contract, which takes place during the production process, allows the employee and the employer to decide on further actions, to understand what is needed both to continue the efficiency of the enterprise and to open a new potential of these relations, and to direct the change of the employment contract precisely to it. Due to the manifestation of the free will of the parties to the employment contract, the boundaries of which are defined by the norms of the current legislation, built considering the moral-normative substance, identification of one\u2019s place in the given legal relationship or outside of it for the nearest period takes place. The apparent meaning of the agreement as an agreement of the parties, which is the basis of the employment contract, determines the directions and algorithms for possible changes to the latter: with the consent of both parties, in the case of agreement of the conditions covered by the content of the employment contract, but not against the will of the other party, forcibly.

      "abstract": "The development of popular Islamic media in the digital era, associated with an authority shift from traditional to popular religion, has enhanced peoples\u2019 ways of thinking. Ironically, conservative and radical Islamic models have dominated the digital space. Therefore, in response to this phenomenon, this research examines how the mainstreaming strategy of religious moderation is carried out by moderate groups, specifically a non-affiliated Islamic portal called Islami.co, with the tagline \u201cEnlightening and Friendly Islamic Media.\u201d This research also analyzed articles, concepts, and perspectives to determine whether they are in the moderate category using the J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 theory of communicative rationality. Furthermore, the essays in the islami.co were analyzed according to three kinds of validity claims, namely truth, accuracy, and honesty. This study concluded that mainstreaming religious moderation through this islami.co\u2019s media significantly impacts the community as a filter from news content or thoughts that do not reflect the Islamic value of mercy to all mankind. Islami.co\u2019s writers continuously endeavor to test conservative-radical Islamic narratives that develop in a society with logical (aqli) and religious (naqli) arguments presented with brief and uncomplicated explanations. The strategy of popular Islamic portals such as islami.co is quite acceptable to middle-class Muslims, as often preached by the fundamentalist groups. Therefore, it is very appropriate to direct islami.co\u2019s target audience to readers from the general public.

      "abstract": "This study examined the cognitive response of Indonesian society (namely, the people who use digital mass media) to the narratives built by digital mass media. Establishing an argumentative \u201ccommunication\u201d relationship between digital mass media and society is necessary because the narratives built by digital mass media tend to represent particular interests. Therefore, between the two, an argumentative \u201ccommunication\u201d relationship is needed to reach a consensus through the expression of rational language. This relationship actually forms a communicative society based on the value of emancipatory critical rationality to achieve \"consensus\". Thus, the problem posed in this study, \u2018How is the cognitive response and form of digital society in Indonesia within the scope of the digital mass media era?\u2019 To answer that question this study used a qualitative approach by conducting a sociological study of the narratives in the digital mass media user community, especially convergence mass media (kompas.com, tempo.co, and tribunnews.com). While the technique of the validity test of the narrative data of people who use digital mass media uses was the triangulation technique of sources and theories. This study found that digital society can create and produce imaginative spaces based on its own laws and culture. Its awareness of the digital mass media narrative is solid and shifts its passive role as an object to be \u2018interactive\u2019 (itself as a subject) with mass media. Meanwhile, the relationship between digital society and communication technology has three options, namely, first, digital society positions itself as technology; second, humanize technology as itself; and third, dialectically compromising the potential of humanity and technology.",

Because of its process-based and inclusive qualities, Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality is particularly apposite for the dynamic nature of digital open-source information and the heterogenous range of actors and institutions which have relevant experiences and skills to contribute to the generation of norms and determinations regarding its role before the Court. This is important, as the International Criminal Court\u2019s procedural framework is largely silent on digital material, despite the risks of such materials being misinterpreted or misused as a vehicle for disinformation. In the absence of prescriptive regulatory responses, this article argues that J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality provides a justifiable framework for the court\u2019s judicial deliberations regarding digital information. Importantly, Habermas emphasizes forming a broad epistemic community to draw specialists into the deliberative process. As the truth-seeking evidentiary function increasingly moves outside of the courtroom, Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality constitutes an inclusive approach capable of inculcating specialized knowledge into judicial deliberations. In this way, communicative rationality can provide a powerful conceptual justification for the judicial exercise of power regarding the emerging phenomenon of digital open-source information.",

The concept of communicative reciprocity is essential here. Those equipped with the norm of reciprocity can better comprehend diversities and complexities, as well as the conflict-ridden aspects of social life, and thus can develop a stronger capacity of nurturing sensitivity to live in harmony with other people. This paper attempts to apply the concept of communicative rationality and reciprocity to the areas of business ethics in order to explore the significance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Ecological and Social Governance (ESG) as innovations in corporate governance. In addition, this paper will draw special attention to Stockowner\u2013Employee (SOE) partnership as a new experiment of business ethics in Republic of Korea. By doing so, this paper aims to grasp the attributes of those who are more capable than others of understanding the norms and practices of CSR within an economic enterprise, with the view that reciprocal sympathy can serve as a communicative basis for what we might call responsible capitalist culture. The main arguments this paper makes are: (1) the recent change in the value orientations of shareholders in support for CSR and ESG can be interpreted as an expression of communicative reciprocity and justice; and (2) the transformation of business ethics in the direction of CSR and ESG means that classical liberalism has begun to turn to a \u201cresponsible\u201d liberalism. Survey data collected from a Korean company will be analyzed to show how the norm of reciprocity is reflected in the relationship between corporations and society on the one hand and between shareholders and employees on the other.",

      "abstract": "How communicative rationality is constructed and shared among interlocutors in a court in the seeking of justice, given the background of distrust in the Kenyan Presidential Election context, gave attention to this study. The study investigated the construction of communicative rationality in the courtyard. The study assessed the types of illocutionary forces and their discursive legal practices and determined how interlocutors redeem the illocutionary logic in the courtyard. A documentary review of the written judgment of Ruto against Odinga in the presidential election of 2022 was used as the data collection method. The analytical frameworks involved Austin's (1962b) Speech Act theory and Searle and Vanderveken's (1985) illocutionary commitments. The findings showed that petitioners chose illocutionary forces to downgrade respondents' claims. The discursive nature of their legal practices was characterized by a lack of fairness, transparency, and integrity of IEBC and its Chairperson. Respondents used illocutionary forces, including denials, for face protection and repair. Their discursive legal practices were characterized by compliance, transparency, and accountability to win the Court's decision. Petitioners and respondents used much propositional content, modes of achievement, and preparatory conditions to construct their validity claims. In achieving justice, the group of Judges must consider interlocutors' presentations of credible statements of truth and acceptable normative statements of legal practices. A group of Judges needs to take precautions against the interlocutors' tricks and manipulation of the Constitution for effective decision-making.",

In such a situation, reaching public consensus in modern societies is critical for understanding the further development of the state and society, in particular, in multinational Kazakhstan. The research is aimed at identifying and interpreting approaches to understanding the idea of social consensus in the Western and Eastern traditional philosophical paradigms, represented by some of most influential philosophers. The study also identifies the role and place of traditional Kazakh philosophical thought and the possibility of its application in modern social relations. The strategies of harmony within the philosophical paradigms of the conditional mega-regions of the East and West are determined by a narrow segmentation of philosophical texts. In the course of the study, it is proposed to single out two basic consensus strategies, rational\u2013pragmatic and spiritual\u2013moral, or, in other words: communicative rationality and axiological identity.",

The article contends that the emergence of communicative rationality in the public sphere is unlikely to be facilitated by a singular and unitary modern public whose participants have commensurable languages and worlds. This argument is elaborated through an analysis of a public debate that occurred on August 10, 1888, between the Mahajan (headman) of the Modh Baniya caste council and Mohandas K. Gandhi, a Modh Baniya himself. Even though the discussion involved two people with an intersubjectively shared lifeworld, who were engaged in the deliberation as equals, the dialogue broke down, deepening divides. This article argues that the need to protect the spiritual domain from the polluting touch of the material domain led to the breakdown of communicative rationality.",

Fast-paced automation, the importance of cosmopolitanism and the colonial legacy have come to dominate educational discourse and drive calls for streamlined educative practice. Although such efficiency models empower a transactional/linear mode of teaching and learning, they do little to privilege integrative voices, deliberation and intersubjective care found in global citizenship education (GCE) definitions. We argue such rationality has exacerbated a neo-colonial ethic that promulgates economic, political and cultural pressure to control and narrow otherwise diverse learning opportunities. Drawing from recent research into technology and GCE in two International Baccalaureate international schools, we note the importance of communicative outreach and agency in diversity. We also highlight the distorting effects of hyper-rationalised neo-colonial interpretations of global agency. This article will interest those seeking to develop global educational policy and practice along with revitalising interpretations of technology integration.",

A useful way to conceptualise these is to draw from ideas of communities of practice and communicative rationality, with the degree of student autonomy a third key element. We illustrate this approach with a study of Kuppi, an example of peer assisted learning initiated and organised entirely by students. We interviewed undergraduate participants from six state universities in Sri Lanka and found strong support for this model of peer assisted learning from student learners and student tutors. These classes are characterised by informality and discussion, flexibility in timing and location and a focus on assessments. Students determine the content and who teaches, whilst tutors give their time without payment, out of fraternity and to improve their own learning and skills. The theory of communicative rationality helped explain much of the attraction of this form of peer assisted learning. There was evidence for a strong community of practice; however apart from peer tutors aspiring to become academics, this involved mostly reinforcement of student identity rather than transformation into emerging roles. The high levels of engagement and student autonomy shown by Kuppi challenge suggestions that peer assisted learning must be organised by tutors if it is to be effective.",

Compared with the presence space, the absence space is a space where facial expressions, specific places, and specific environments are not presented. It is a virtual space with the connotation of information flow, symbol display, language exchange and meaning pursuit. The communicative action in the absence space is constructed with symbols as the core, and has new content compared to the previous presence space. Correspondingly, the communicative action in the network public sphere has also formed new characteristics: the cross-temporal and spatial nature of communicative symbols in the communication process, the perceptibility of attitude trends, the diversity of cultural backgrounds, and the low cost of interaction. This article focuses on the impact of the low cost of interaction on the communication action in the network public sphere. On the one hand, the low cost of interaction is an important factor that directly leads to the low degree of rationalization of communicative actions. On the other hand, this feature is also an important force to promote the rise of the network public sphere, because the low cost of interaction makes the discussion in the public sphere more adequate. As far as the current social situation is concerned, the rationality of communication in the network public sphere has not been fully established. Finally, combined with Habermas' theory of communicative action, this article believes that the core of establishing communicative rationality in the Internet age lies in the modernization of human.",

Turning to the achievements of the historical sociology of revolutions and social movements allows us to understand the politicization of social problems in modern Russia within a broader theoretical context. As well it allows us to understand politicization in modern Russia within the context of state crises as revolutionary politicization (which is a consequence of \u201crevolutionary neurosis\u201d phenomenon). Besides this turning helps theoretically explore the politicization of social problems in modern Russia as a communicative (ideological) crisis in relations between the state and society. This theoretical analysis bases on the qualitative methodology of modern social research in the study of political and social phenomena. The generalized method of this work is the comparative social hermeneutics of historical phenomena of revolutions and states, based on the political theory of J. Habermas. Author considers the politicization of socially significant topics as a constant dialogue between state and society. The communicative rationality of the state aims at understanding in dialogue. Transition from the USSR to the Russian Federation destroyed the Soviet ideological paradigm and a new ideological paradigm is being created, which affects the complexity of the dialogue between state and society. The author concludes that the phenomenon of revolutionary politicization in modern Russia (the abnormality of the dialogue between the state and society) is a consequence of the lack of communicative rationality at the state.",

This idea\u2019s theoretical conceptualisation\u2014a conceptualisation that has proven to be convincing and adequate to the conditions of the modern world\u2014was developed by Professor J\u00fcrgen Habermas, whose ideas and theories were also the subject of a doctoral thesis written by this paper\u2019s author in the latter half of the 1970s under Professor Kuczy\u0144ski\u2019s tutelage. The author shares some grateful memories of his doctoral tutor, and also sets his one-time attempts to apply the theory of communicative action to two experiences of the real socialism era in Poland (the events of 1980/1981 and 1989) against his efforts to analyse contemporary Polish realities through the prism of the communicative rationality conception. This comparison shows that the application of a conception of rationality funded by communicative action to the turbulent transformations under real socialism was to a certain extent na\u00efve\u2014though not devoid of critical significance\u2014and also reveals the preconditions (in the sphere of understanding oneself and the world) for the implementation of the rules of communicative rationality in social and political reality.The paper is in part dedicated to the memory of Professor Kuczy\u0144ski, therefore it contains a somewhat extensive account of the circumstances which led the author to study the thought of Habermas under Kuczy\u0144ski\u2019s tutelage, as well as the consequences of this choice, which proved of considerable significance for his further life. However, the main themes are, first, the validity (and naivety) of applying a conception of rationality funded by communicative action to two significant experiences of the real socialism era, and, secondly, the need\u2014revealed by diagnosing contemporary Polish reality with the help of the communicative rationality conception\u2014for certain preconditions enabling the implementation of this type of rationality in social and political reality. One such precondition is the transition of sufficiently broad parts of society from thinking in terms of worldviews (Weltaunschauungen) to post-metaphysical thinking in terms of the \u201clifeworld\u201d (Lebenswelt).",

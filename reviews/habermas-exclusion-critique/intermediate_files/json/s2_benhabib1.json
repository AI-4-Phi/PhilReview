Neste artigo, eu me proponho a mostrar que a presenca de Arendt no pensamento de Benhabib e ainda mais radical do que parece a primeira vista, pois a autora de\u00a0 A condicao humana \u00a0esta na raiz do seu projeto teorico orientando o enfrentamento filosofico que Benhabib faz com a tradicao, na sua primeira grande obra,\u00a0 Critique, norm, and utopia: a study of the foundations of Critical theory \u00a0(1986). A minha hipotese interpretativa e a de que a tese central deste livro, segundo a qual a teoria critica e assombrada pela filosofia do sujeito, carrega as marcas da critica arendtiana a filosofia politica ocidental. Palavras-Chave:\u00a0 Hannah Arendt; Seyla Benhabib; Filosofia do Sujeito; Filosofia Politica; Pluralidade SEYLA BENHABIB WITH HANNAH ARENDT AGAINST THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SUBJECT ABSTRACT From\u00a0 Situating the self: gender, community and postmodernism in contemporary ethics \u00a0(1992), we know that SeylaBenhabib answers Habermas\u2019 excesses and the limits of the modern universalist tradition with a reinterpretation of the Arendtian conception of \u201cenlarged thought\u201d. In this article, I propose to show that Arendt\u2019s presence in Benhabib\u2019s thought is even more radical than it seems at first, because the author of The human condition is at the root of Benhabib\u2019s theoretical project, guiding her in her philosophical confrontation with tradition at her first major work, Critique, norm, and utopia: a study of the foundations of Critical theory (1986). My interpretive hypothesis is that the central thesis of this book, according to which Critical theory is haunted by the philosophy of the subject, bears the marks of Arendt\u2019s criticism to Western political philosophy. Key words:\u00a0 Hannah Arendt; Seyla Benhabib; Philosophy of the Subject; Political Philosophy; Plurality SEYLA BENHABIB AVEC ARENDT CONTRE LA PHILOSOPHIE DU SUJET ABSTRACT A partir des textes rassembles dans le livre Situating the self: gender, community and postmodernism in contemporary ethics (1992), on sait que Seyla Benhabib repond aux exces rationalistes d\u2019Habermas et aux limites de la tradition universaliste moderne par une reinterpretation de la conception arendtienne du \u00abmentalite elargie\u00bb. Dans cet article, je propose de montrer que la presence d\u2019Arendt dans la pensee de Benhabib est encore plus radicale qu\u2019il n\u2019y parait au premier abord, car Arendt est a l\u2019origine de son projet theorique guidant la confrontation philosophique que Benhabib fait avec tradition, dans son premier grand ouvrage, Critique, norm, and utopia: a study of the foundations of critical theory (1986). Mon hypothese interpretative est que la these centrale de ce livre, selon laquelle la theorie critique est hantee par la philosophie du sujet, porte les marques de la critique arendtienne de la philosophie politique occidentale.

      "abstract": "Throughout her work, Seyla Benhabib develops a consistent reflection on equality and diversity within a globalized context. Beginning with Critique, Norm, and Utopia (1986), she critiques classical critical theory for its reliance on negative critique and abstract utopias, lacking grounding in real normative practices. In Situating the Self (1992), she introduces a feminist and postmodern ethical approach, while The Claims of Culture (2002) explores the balance between equality and cultural diversity. Her work evolves into a theory of democratic cosmopolitanism in The Rights of Others (2004), advocating for universal human rights that transcend national borders. She challenges Kantian universalism and communitarian views like those of MacIntyre, proposing an ethics of responsibility rooted in contextual particularities. In Transformations of Citizenship (2001), she analyzes how globalization reshapes citizenship and belonging. Benhabib also critiques contemporary democratic theories, arguing that Habermas\u2019s deliberative democracy and Mouffe\u2019s agonistic model fail to fully embrace inclusivity. She proposes instead a more participatory and inclusive democratic framework. Furthermore, Benhabib emphasizes Hannah Arendt\u2019s ambivalence toward modernity, highlighting the importance of action and plurality. This paper argues that a unifying thread runs through Benhabib\u2019s work, tying together her reflections on rights, equality, and diversity. Using critical analysis of her writings, the paper demonstrates how Benhabib\u2019s evolving conception of rights aims to integrate inclusive practices, respect for universal norms, and constant legal revision to address the demands of a diverse global era.",

Using the metaphor of \u201cthe mud of everyday life\u201d as a frame, this essay delves into the significance of Benhabib\u2019s work for a philosophy of communication ethics that remains attuned to the ever-changing nature of the dialogic spaces of our postmodern world. An understanding of a situated self in an age of difference dwells in the tradition of practical philosophy. Therefore, Arnett\u2019s insistence on using the metaphor of \u201cthe mud of everyday life\u201d within the contexts of doing philosophy of communication and communication ethics reminds us of the practicalityoriented mode of consciousness and insight in these realms.",

      "abstract": "Toni Morrison\u2019s Song of Solomon, the protagonist Milkman, a middle-class black man, embarks on a coming-of-age journey to search for his southern roots. Having grown up under a patriarchal and materialistic environment, he witnesses the silencing of women in his family, experiences anxious competition for wealth and status within the middle class, and faces the persistent marginalization of his racial identity in a white-dominated society. This leads him to face multiple dilemmas concerning identity, desire, and relationships. Meanwhile, his quest to discover the ancestral roots in the South prompts him to reconsider ethnic history, social hierarchies and gender dynamics, sparking introspection and prompting him to reconstruct his sense of self and ethics. This paper adopts a postmodern ethical viewpoint that centers on the interconnected dimensions of race, class, and gender to dismantle the opposing binaries between white and black communities, dominant and underprivileged groups, and men and women in Song of Solomon. It explores how individuals can develop a moral conscience and sense of ethical responsibility in the face of differences, rebuilding ethical relationships through caring for the \u201cother\u201d. Furthermore, transcending the traditional oppression-resistance paradigm, the study emphasizes the ethical philosophy of \u201cembracing coexistence amidst differences,\u201d offering a new theoretical perspective through which to understand ethical dilemmas in complex reality.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces neoaustenism as a metamodern-feminist sensibility rooted in Jane Austen\u2019s fiction and paradigmatically articulated today through Taylor Swift\u2019s songwriting. While other metamodern-rooted discourses such as neoromanticism revive a largely male genealogy of longing and melancholy, neoaustenism retrieves a specifically feminine grammar of irony, self-reflexivity, and relational ethics. Grounded in affect theory and the ethics of care, the concept reframes vulnerability as a shared resource that turns personal wounds into collective agency. The article first situates neoaustenism within metamodern oscillation and the affective turn. It then traces a gendered genealogy of sentiment from Austen\u2019s heroines to Swift\u2019s layered lyrical voices, showing through close reading how Swift\u2019s songwriting translates Austenian irony and care into pop rituals that foster horizontal communities through reflective nostalgia, audience co-authorship, and embodied practices. Finally, this article argues that neoaustenism holds potential beyond Swift and offers a critical horizon for (re)imagining feminine identity and resilience in neoliberal culture, thus inviting further interdisciplinary inquiry.",

      "abstract": "Benhabib reframes the question of whether civil society can accommodate the conflicting demands of cultural, ethnic, and gendered identities. While these are often presented as incommensurable, she argues that discourse theory provides a foundation for negotiating paths through and beyond such conflicts. Her oeuvre forensically maps the territories of individual and collective self-knowing and self-organisation, finding fissures and harmonies between these tectonic plates of human experience. Communication is the agent for creating possible futures. She has described her central concern as \u201chow to reconcile universalistic principles of human rights, autonomy, and freedom with our concrete identity as members of certain human communities divided by language, by ethnicity, by religion.\u201d This constitutes one of the most \u2018wicked \u2019problems facing contemporary society, using the term wicked to indicate intractability. Engaging with such foundational concepts requires a moral clarity\u2014even bravery\u2014that is evident throughout her work. While earlier texts look to social justice to reconcile demands for individual self-expression with those for social stability, later works explore cosmopolitanism under increasing duress.",

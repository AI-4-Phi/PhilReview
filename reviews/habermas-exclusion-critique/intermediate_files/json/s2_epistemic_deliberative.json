      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore some links between deliberative democracy, natural testimony, and epistemic injustice. We hope to highlight the exclusionary effects of some cases of testimony-related epistemic injustice within the deliberative democratic framework and, in particular, two subtle ways of epistemic injustice that are not often highlighted in the political domain. In other words, we hope to highlight two specific mechanisms of epistemic exclusion within the democratic deliberative process that are not explicitly noticed in the relevant literature. In section 1, we present the deliberative model of democracy and the deliberative process. We then introduce the notion of epistemic (dis)enfranchisement, which we distinguish from formal enfranchisement, and explain the role that natural testimony plays in establishing citizens\u2018 epistemic enfranchisement. In section 2, we introduce Fricker\u2018s notion of testimonial injustice and two further testimony-related forms of epistemic injustice which seem to have been largely neglected in the debate so far, namely, discursive injustice and testimonial void. We also point out negative epistemic consequences of positive identity-prejudicial stereotypes. In section 3, we argue that these testimony-related forms of epistemic injustice can lead to epistemic disenfranchisement, which, we note, is an obstacle to deliberative democracy that warrants serious consideration.",

We argue that citizen science can be seen as one element of \u201cdeliberative systems,\u201d as described by Mansbridge et al. But in order to fulfil its democratic potential, citizen science needs to be attentive to various forms of exclusion and epistemic injustice, as analyzed by Fricker, Medina and others. Moreover, to tap the potentials of citizen science from the perspective of deliberative democracy, it needs to move towards a more empowered approach, in which citizens do not only deliver data points, but also, in invited or uninvited settings, participate in discussions about the goals and implications of research. Integrating citizen science into the deliberative systems approach embeds it in a broader framework of democratic theory and suggests the transmission of certain practical strategies (e.g., randomized sampling). It can also contribute to realism about both the potentials and the limits of citizen science. As part of a deliberative system, citizen science cannot, and need not, be the only place in which reforms are necessary for creating stronger ties between science and society and for aligning science with democratic values.",

      "abstract": "In examining epistemic injustice as outlined by Fricker, I highlight its conceptual shortcomings and propose a synthesis that includes class-based inequalities. Philosophical ideas and sociological theories share similar notions of power, as found in Foucault\u2019s analysis, Fricker\u2019s concept of epistemic justice, and Marxist critical theories. Yet discourse on epistemic injustice too often neglects the experiences of subordinated social classes, necessitating a framework that acknowledges how they are excluded. \nWhile most research focuses on colonialism, ethnicity, and gender, class remains underexplored. Fricker argues that certain groups face discrimination through the availability of limited conceptual resources, stigmatization, and marginalization. This hinders their understanding of political conditions. If class epistemic injustice is widely condemned, do we also grant credibility to manual workers and those living in precarious circumstances? \nDeliberative democracy presupposes rational communication and consensus on discussion rules, but these can exclude subjugated classes lacking the education that transmits dominant communicative skills. Consequently, they remain marginalized. A political-sociological approach would address structural inequalities and highlight the ways dominant classes sustain privilege. By acknowledging and integrating the contributions of all social class, we can build more equitable frameworks that advance our understanding of epistemic injustice across the board.",

      "abstract": "Epistemic injustice means that knowledge relevant to collective decisions gets discounted, thus inflicting harm on disadvantaged groups. The most familiar kinds (established by Fricker 2007) are testimonial (dismissing arguments because of the social characteristics of the speaker) and hermeneutical (lack of collective interpretive resources to make sense of oppression). We develop the idea of expressive epistemic justice, which exists when social forces induce a systematic failure for an individual or group\u2019s values and beliefs to be reflected in what the individual or group expresses as its wants. Expressive epistemic injustice can persist even if testimonial and hermeneutic injustice were to be eliminated. The degree of failure can be quantified, enabling us in an empirical analysis of multiple cases to locate the source of expressive epistemic injustice in the conditions of discourse in a public sphere awash in symbolic manipulations by relatively powerful actors. We then show how citizen deliberation can remedy expressive epistemic justice. Our analysis adds to existing epistemic arguments for deliberative democracy, for it shows that deliberation increases the likelihood that collective decisions will respond to the values and beliefs that define these decisions as good to begin with.",

This book offers a systematic account of epistemic power and agency by turning to the dynamics of epistemic injustice\u2014that is, the many forms epistemic injustice can take, the different sites and mechanisms through which it operates, and the various transformations consequently required to cultivate greater epistemic justice. Adopting standpoint theory both as a theory and as a methodology, the book focuses on several pressing social questions, such as deliberative impasses in divided societies, colonial memory, academic migration, the underrepresentation of members of non-dominant groups in certain fields, and the marginalization of minoritized minds, such as intellectually disabled people and Autistics. By analyzing these social questions through the lens of the dynamics of epistemic injustice, the book develops a systematic account of epistemic power and agency.",

Adopting a theoretical and speculative approach, it develops a conceptual framework that bridges debates on epistemic injustice with digital transformation in museums. We argue that traditional museums frequently perpetuate testimonial and hermeneutic injustices due to entrenched cultural biases, and that merely expanding digital catalogs may risk reproducing these exclusions. To address this, we introduce the notion of the deliberative museum: a participatory digital space integrated into traditional institutions, where marginalized voices are actively included and curatorial choices are subject to public negotiation. This model should be understood as a conceptual thought experiment, intended to reframe visibility and participation so that museums can evolve into more inclusive and reflexive spaces of epistemic justice. In this sense, the integration of virtual elements into traditional museums highlights the potential of digital affordances to expand representation and dialogue.",

      "abstract": "This paper contributes to growing debates over the decision-making ability of democracy by considering the epistemic value of deliberative democracy. It focuses on the benefits democratic deliberation can derive from its diversity, and the extent to which these benefits can be realised with respect to the complexities of political problems. The paper first calls attention to the issue of complexity through a critique of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore and the Diversity Trumps Ability Theorem. This approach underestimates complexity due to its reliance on an \u2018oracle assumption\u2019 and this is shown to highlight more general difficulties for applying the benefits of diversity to the realities of political problems. The paper then develops a new model of deliberation\u2014based on an relationship between cognitive diversity and diminishing returns to cognitive type\u2014which does not involve an oracle assumption and can therefore support the epistemic value of deliberative democracy even for complex problems. The benefits of diversity are also argued to be better realised though sortition than either democratic elections or epistocracy, pointing to the value of deliberation between randomly selected citizens. Finally, and contrary to past work, the new account suggests that diversity cannot alone establish the superiority of democratic deliberation over all non-democratic alternatives, and that it is insufficient to mount a purely epistemic argument for deliberative democracy. The paper therefore furthers our understanding of the epistemic value of deliberative democracy by clarifying when and to what extent diversity is a benefit to political problem solving.",

Such a strategy may meet with great interest, which in some circumstances increases participation and might influence deliberation. It was applied in South Korea, and its variations appeared in the USA, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Sweden, or Pakistan, differing in scale and context of use. We argue that deep fakes in political advertising, due to multidimensional manipulation, can undermine the epistemic and ethical value of democratic debate, although it has the potential to increase citizens' involvement in political processes, in particular by overcoming linguistic exclusion. The aim of this commentary is to put registered campaigns in the context of the systemic approach to deliberative democracy by Mansbridge et\u00a0al. (2012) that comprises three basic functions of deliberative systems: epistemic, ethical, and democratic, and assess their influence on standards of deliberation.",

To examine several original models of deliberative democracy proposed in foreign scientific literature and provide a critical analysis of the arguments given by the authors in support of their models.Methodology. The methods of comparative, regulatory and critical analysis are used. First of all, the model proposed by A. Gutmann and D. Thompson is considered, then, the models presented by J. Habermas, C. Nino and R. Goodin.Results. Consideration of all the models demonstrates that, firstly, different thinkers understand the goals and meaning of deliberation in different ways, seeing it as either epistemic or non-epistemic value, and secondly, deliberation itself can be understood in two ways, namely as a discussion and as an reflection (thoughtfulness), which allows to talk about the existence of actually two different theories of deliberative democracy: discursive and reflexive.Research implications. The results obtained make it possible to better understand the phenomenon of deliberative democracy by offering two possible classifications of the deliberative models.",

      "abstract": "At the beginning of the 21st century, some Western political theorists tried to justify democracy in an epistemic way. They wanted to prove that democracy leads to the most correct political decisions. Consequently, it is reasonable to say that a new normative theory of democracy has emerged \u2014 the epistemic theory. The article demonstrates that the existing epistemic justifications of democracy are presented in the forms of rational/moderate epistemic proceduralism (D. Estlund et al.), pure\u00a0\u00a0 epistemic proceduralism (F. Peter), as well as in other forms, for example reliability democracy (S. Priji\u0107 Samar\u017eija). Within the framework of the first form, three main ways of epistemic justification of democracy can be distinguished, namely through the demonstration of epistemic advantages of: 1) deliberative practices; 2) the Condorcet jury theorem; 3) opinions\u2019 diversity (the formula \u201cdiversity trumps ability\u201d). Doubts are expressed that epistemic democracy can be seen as a form of deliberative democracy. This is because epistemic democrats not only value deliberation but also what is called the \u201cmiracle of aggregation\u201d. The article explores the ideas of the main representatives of the epistemic theory of democracy and suggests\u00a0\u00a0 the most promising ways to criticize these theories. It also points out that all epistemic democrats lack a clear theory of\u00a0\u00a0 how their justifications relate to the purely procedural justifications of democracy based on the value of political equality.",

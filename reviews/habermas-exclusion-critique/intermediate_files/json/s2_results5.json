      "abstract": ": In recent years, postgraduate enrollment has been increasing greatly and the number of postgraduate students is also increasing year by year. Therefore, the harmonious issue of supervisor-postgraduate relationship becomes an academic hot-spot. However, daily supervisor-postgraduate relationship is affected by the universal application of instrumental reason. In view of this, this paper draws on the core connotation of Habermas' theory of interactional behaviour to analyse the real dilemma of the current mentoring relationship, and to reconstruct the new era of graduate student mentoring relationship of mutual respect, understanding, equality, and harmonious coexistence in terms of four dimensions: interactional rationality, language, life world, and intersubjectivity.",

      "abstract": "The idea of rational understanding lays very close to the heart of Professor Janusz Kuczy\u0144ski, an advocate of universalism as well as dialogue between diverse philosophical schools and worldviews, and doctoral advisor to the present paper\u2019s author. This idea\u2019s theoretical conceptualisation\u2014a conceptualisation that has proven to be convincing and adequate to the conditions of the modern world\u2014was developed by Professor J\u00fcrgen Habermas, whose ideas and theories were also the subject of a doctoral thesis written by this paper\u2019s author in the latter half of the 1970s under Professor Kuczy\u0144ski\u2019s tutelage. The author shares some grateful memories of his doctoral tutor, and also sets his one-time attempts to apply the theory of communicative action to two experiences of the real socialism era in Poland (the events of 1980/1981 and 1989) against his efforts to analyse contemporary Polish realities through the prism of the communicative rationality conception. This comparison shows that the application of a conception of rationality funded by communicative action to the turbulent transformations under real socialism was to a certain extent na\u00efve\u2014though not devoid of critical significance\u2014and also reveals the preconditions (in the sphere of understanding oneself and the world) for the implementation of the rules of communicative rationality in social and political reality.The paper is in part dedicated to the memory of Professor Kuczy\u0144ski, therefore it contains a somewhat extensive account of the circumstances which led the author to study the thought of Habermas under Kuczy\u0144ski\u2019s tutelage, as well as the consequences of this choice, which proved of considerable significance for his further life. However, the main themes are, first, the validity (and naivety) of applying a conception of rationality funded by communicative action to two significant experiences of the real socialism era, and, secondly, the need\u2014revealed by diagnosing contemporary Polish reality with the help of the communicative rationality conception\u2014for certain preconditions enabling the implementation of this type of rationality in social and political reality. One such precondition is the transition of sufficiently broad parts of society from thinking in terms of worldviews (Weltaunschauungen) to post-metaphysical thinking in terms of the \u201clifeworld\u201d (Lebenswelt).",

Among the aspects of his work addressed are his conception of communicative rationality as a countervailing force to the colonization of the lifeworld by capitalism and his understanding of philosophy after Hegel as postmetaphysical thinking, for which he has recently provided a comprehensive historical grounding. The scope and relevance of his ideas can be seen from his reflections on current issues, ranging from the prospects of translational democracy at a time of resurgent nationalism and populism, to political developments in Germany since reunification, to the role of religion in the public sphere and the impact of the new social media on democratic discourse.",

      "abstract": "This research aims to develop the concept of universal moral dialogue by harmonizing the thoughts of three important figures: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Al-Farabi, and Confucius in the context of the ethics of intercultural communication. Habermas put forward a theory of communicative action that emphasizes rationality and intersubjective agreement. Meanwhile, Al-Farabi highlighted the importance of virtue and collective purpose in creating an ideal society, and Confucius emphasized the principles of harmony, hierarchical relationships, and the values of politeness. Through qualitative analysis with a literature study approach, this study finds similarities between the three thoughts, namely the importance of a dialogue based on morality that integrates rationality, virtue, and harmony. The proposed model of intercultural communication consists of five main pillars: equality in dialogue, respect for diversity, the search for common truth, the application of virtue, and the achievement of collective harmony. This model is particularly relevant in facing the increasingly urgent challenges of globalization for ethical and inclusive intercultural interactions. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to address the relationship of complementarity and co-originality between Law and Morality from the perspective of J\u00fcrgen Habermas's Discourse Theory of Law and Discourse Ethics. First, the formal pragmatic analysis of communicative rationality and practical rationality in post-metaphysical thought will be introduced, as well as post-conventional justification and the validity of moral norms oughtness. Then, the cognitive content of morality will be outlined through the elaboration of the principle of universalization (U) and the principle of discourse ethics (D). The co-originality will be discussed in the sense that the Principle of Democracy is derived from \u201cD.\u201d The complementarity relationship will be examined based on how Morality, in light of the Principle of Universalization (U), provides normative content in terms of universalizable reasons to Law, while Law addresses its cognitive, operational, and motivational deficits. Positive law and post-conventional morality are thus the main mechanisms of social integration in modernity, as they permeate the structural components of the lifeworld. Finally, the relationship between these mechanisms should be one of complementarity; otherwise, Law, which is known to be constituted in the tension between facticity and validity and, therefore, always mutable, risks losing its capacity for social integration and expectation stabilization.",

      "abstract": "This article argues that Habermas\u2019s formal-pragmatics are better understood as a set of weak-universal dispositions susceptible to erosion over the course of a lifetime, if exposed to continual \u201cdisappointing\u201d communicative experiences. Habermas\u2019s rational-reconstructive project to explicate the intuitive rule-consciousness held by competent speakers retains immense theoretical value for analyzing both partisan and mass political discourse, if his emphasis on isolated speech situations is supplemented with a logic of communicative memory better accounting for how disagreement antecedes discourse on the formal-pragmatic register. I argue that Habermas\u2019s concept of the \u201clifeworld\u201d contains untapped theoretical resources for thinking about the formal-pragmatic consequences of accumulated partisan experiences; namely, how such experiences lead inter-partisan actors to jettison mutual imputations of communicative accountability. I conclude by offering revisions to Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics. Rapport-building intended to alleviate the negative effects of prior accumulated partisan experiences is first necessary if a norm is to enjoy real justification.",

      "abstract": "The research entitled Construction of Public Sphere of Sasadu Traditional Houses in Sahu Tribe Community Reviewed from the Philosophy of J\u00fcrgen Habermas is motivated by the views of Sahu tribe community on their traditional houses which, according to the writer, only focus on the cultural-customary-religious traditions. In fact, Sasadu can be interpreted more than that, which is as a public Sphere in which Sahu tribe community together with the public authorities can build rational communicative discourse to reach consensus on the social, economic and political problems faced in West Halmahera for the sake of prosperity in living together. This research aimed to construct the philosophical concept of Sasadu traditional houses in Sahu tribu community based on the public sphere point of view of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. This research was a library study supported by field studies through observations and interviews. The method of data analysis applied in this research was philosophical hermeneutics. After conducting a search in this research, the results obtained are that Sasadu in Sahu tribe community in West Halmahera can be categorized as a public sphere in which private people and public authorities gather to form a \u201cpublic\u201d for developing argumentative rational discourse which will later be agreed to become a joint decision as a society which leads to public opinion. Sasadu, thus becomes a mediator between the private sphere of Sahu tribe community and the sphere of public authority, where social control is built and the values of universality are guarded.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of hermeneutic science is outlined by Habermas as a reflection within the ordinary language, addressed to the dialogic dimension of intersubjective recognition and connected to the juridical guarantee. The guarantee function fulfilled by the discursive agreement towards every real dialogue is obvious: it indicates the main reference point for the regulation and coordination of social action, tracing a line of demarcation between being and having to be, facts and norms. Speech, communicative agreement and legal guarantee are mutually qualified terms where the public discussion of institutional issues makes it possible to define the normative validity as non-assimilatory generality, placed beyond any populistic yearning, tracing a line of demarcation between law and power. The idea of deliberative democracy expresses the relationship and distinction between the universalism of rights and the factuality of the norm issuing, between the idea of good and the idea of right, in order to support democratic decision-making legitimacy. Combining the reasons of the markets with those of civil solidarity, through independent forms of regulation both from the obsolete state sovereignties and from the traditional international perspectives, represents a primary challenge of the Habermasian theory where the critical role of the rational public sphere appears fundamental.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Critical social theories look critically at the ways in which particular social arrangements hinder human flourishing, with a view to bringing about social change for the better. In this they are guided by the idea of a good society in which the identified social impediments to human flourishing would once and for all have been removed. The question of how these guiding ideas of the good life can be justified as valid across socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs is the most fundamental difficulty facing critical social theories today. This problem of justification, which can be traced back to certain key shifts in the modern Western social imaginary, calls on contemporary theories to negotiate the tensions between the idea of context\u2010transcendent validity and their own anti\u2010authoritarian impulses. Habermas makes an important contribution towards resolving the problem, but takes a number of wrong turnings. Keywords: Critical theorynon\u2010authoritarian theoryautonomyHabermasformal pragmaticsHabermas's theory of justice Notes 1 In situating critical social theory within the modern Western social imaginary, I do not wish to imply that this form of modernity is in any sense superior to other forms. I follow S. N. Eisenstadt in confining myself to the thesis that it is distinctive; I also follow Eisenstadt in recognizing 'the great variability of the symbolic, ideological and institutional responses to it [Western modernity], of the ways in which different civilizations and societies interpret different symbolic premises of modernity and different modern institutional patterns and dynamics'. S. N. Eisenstadt, 'Introduction', in S. N. Eisenstadt (ed.) Patterns of Modernity, Vol. 1: The West (London: Frances Pinter, 1987), pp. 1\u201311, here, p. 5. 2 Here I am guided by Cornelius Castoriadis's view that every society creates a social imaginary that determines society's values and the institutions that embody them. However, I use the term in a general way without committing myself to other aspects of Castoriadis's account of the social imaginary. See C. Castoriadis, The Imaginary Institution of Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987). My use of the term is closer to that of Charles Taylor. See C. Taylor, Modern Social Imaginaries (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2004). 3 A well\u2010known example here is Nietzsche, who challenged key elements of the modern world\u2010view, for example, the assumptions that human beings are equal and that historical time is progressive, and took on the task of reorienting our perceptions with regard to these. See F. Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans. T. Common (London: Allen and Unwin, 1967) and F. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, trans. R. J. Hollingdale (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1973). 4 R. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). 5 This is Robert Brandom's gloss on Rorty's utopian idea of unfettered imaginative activity in his 'Vocabularies of Pragmatism: Synthesizing Naturalism and Historicism', in R. Brandom (ed.) Rorty and his Critics (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), p. 179. Rorty claims to be in enthusiastic agreement with the sections of Brandom's essays from which this quotation is taken in his 'Response to Robert Brandom', in Rorty and his Critics, pp. 184 and 189. 6 See Butler's contributions to J. Butler, E. Laclau and S. \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality (London: Verso, 2000). 7 J. Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols. 1 and 2, trans. T. McCarthy (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1984 and 1987). 8 Examples here are A. Honneth, Struggle for Recognition, trans. J. Anderson (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995), J. Habermas, 'Individuation through Socialization: On George Herbert Mead's Theory of Subjectivity', in his Postmetaphysical Thinking, trans. W. M. Hohengarten (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), pp. 149\u2013204, and J. Habermas, 'Morality and Ethical Life: Does Hegel's Critique of Kant Apply to Discourse Ethics?', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, trans. C. Lenhardt and S. Weber Nicholsen (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), pp. 195\u2013215. 9 M. Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006). For an earlier effort in the same direction, see M. Cooke, 'A Space of One's Own: Autonomy, Privacy, Liberty', Philosophy and Social Criticism, 25 (1) (1999), pp. 23\u201353. 10 More precisely, the 'us' refers to 'us educated, sophisticated, tolerant, wet liberals, the people who are always willing to hear the other side, to think out all the implications, etc.' R. Rorty, 'Putnam and the Relativist Menace', Journal of Philosophy, 90 (9) (1993), 443\u201361, here, pp. 451\u20132. 11 For Butler, the normative and optimistic aspect of critical social thinking consists 'in the possibilities for expanding the key terms of liberalism, rendering them more inclusive, more dynamic and more concrete'. See J. Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', in Butler, Laclau and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 11\u201343, here, p. 13. Butler actually refers to 'the normative and optimistic moment' of hegemony; however, her formulation seems equally applicable to critical social thinking as she conceives it. 12 'Dogmatic' is used in the 'harmless sense' that for us, who have developed our identities within the socio\u2010cultural context of Western modernity, it cannot be circumvented. J. Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, trans. W. Rehg (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), pp. 445\u201356. 13 See J. Butler, 'Gender Trouble, Feminist Theory, and Psychoanalytic Discourse', in L. Nicholson (ed.) Feminism/Postmodernism (New York: Routledge, 1990), p. 324\u201340. In her most recent writings, however, there is some evidence that Butler is now less hostile to the notions of subjectivity with which the idea of autonomy is linked and may even be prepared to view autonomy as one of the key terms of liberal modernity that are open to creative rearticulation and re\u2010enactment. See J. Butler, Antigone's Claim: Kinship between Life and Death (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000) and J. Butler, Undoing Gender (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). 14 I outline the concept of autonomy that in my view best takes account of this intuition in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 15 Ferrara posits coherence and depth as two of the four normative requirements of authentic identity: A. Ferrara, Reflective Authenticity (London: Routledge, 1998). 16 Butler is likely to reject the very terms in which this disagreement is cast. Nor is it clear on which side of the divide she would position herself, even if she were to accept its terms. In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, I argue, nonetheless, that this is an issue of central concern to her theory and that a context\u2010transcending position would make best sense of her idea of universality as radical translation (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). 17 For Butler, all forms of identity \u2013 for example, the identity of individual subjects \u2013 are constituted differentially. That is, their constitution produces a constitutive outside that can never become fully inside or immanent. On the 'incompletion' of what she calls the subject position, see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', p. 12. 18 Butler, 'Dynamic Conclusions', in Butler, Laclan and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 263\u2013280, here, p. 268. 19 Habermas, who defends a context\u2010transcending position, accuses radically contextualist approaches such as Rorty's of collapsing the distinction between the strategic and non\u2010strategic uses of language. J. Habermas, 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn', in his On the Pragmatics of Communication, edited and with an introduction by M. Cooke (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), pp. 343\u201382. Rorty replies in his 'Response to Habermas', in Brandom, Rorty and his Critics, p. 58. 20 These objections to a radically contextualist critical approach are tailored to discursive \u2013 argumentation\u2010based \u2013 models of social criticism. However, as I point out in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, there are equivalent objections to non\u2010argumentative models of social criticism. 21 Other contemporary thinkers who explicitly endorse a context\u2010transcending approach include Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser. See their respective contributions in N. Fraser and A. Honneth, Redistribution or Recognition? A Political\u2010Philosophical Exchange (London: Verso, 2003). 22 The term Habermas uses to describe what I call the anti\u2010authoritarian impulse of contemporary critical social theory is 'post\u2010metaphysical'. See Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking. For a brief account of the postmetaphysical character of Habermas's idea of communicative rationality see M. Cooke, Language and Reason (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1994), pp. 38\u201343. As I point out below, Habermas's postmetaphysical approach goes beyond anti\u2010authoritarian approaches by leaving no room for the postulate of a transcendent \u2013 metaphysical \u2013 object. 23 Axel Honneth uses the term 'Left\u2010Hegelian' to describe the tradition of critical social thinking out of which the critical theory of the Frankfurt School emerges. The term has the advantage that it makes explicit the Frankfurt School's concern to rearticulate the critical social thinking of Hegel, as interpreted above all by Marx and Luk\u00e1cs. See A. Honneth, 'Eine Soziale Pathologie der Vernunft. Zur intellektuellen Erbschaft der Kritischen Theorie', in C. Halbig and M. Quante (eds), Sozialphilosophie zwischen Kritik und Anerkennung (M\u00fcnster, Hamburg, Berlin, Wien, London: LIT Verlag, 2003). 24 Cf. A. Honneth, 'The Social Dynamics of Disrespect: On the Location of Critical Theory Today', Constellations, 1 (2) (1994), pp. 255\u201369. 25 M. Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, The Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. J. Cumming (London: Allen Lane, 1973). 26 Evidently, it also gives rise to a problem of motivation since the authors eliminate the possibility of any kind of human reflection on, or conscious human resistance to, the oppressive, dehumanizing effects of twentieth\u2010century capitalism. 27 Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols 1 and 2. 28 J. Habermas, 'What is Universal Pragmatics?', in Habermas, On the Pragmatics of Communication, pp. 21\u2013103. See also Cooke, Language and Reason. It should be noted that Habermas sees reconstructive theories as dependent on indirect validation by other theories. See J. Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 116\u201394, here, pp. 116\u201318. 29 Habermas's clearest statement of the role which formal pragmatics plays in justifying his theory of communicative action can be found his writings on discourse ethics. See J. Habermas, 'Discourse Ethics: Notes on A Program of Philosophical Justification', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 42\u2013115 (esp. pp. 82\u201398). Here, the universalist character of his formal\u2010pragmatic hypotheses is evident, for example, when he states that 'the principle of universalization [\u2026] is implied by the presuppositions of argumentation in general' (p.86, my italics). To be sure, it is not clear how exactly this statement is to be understood. On occasion, he suggests that certain of the strong idealizations on which his theory depends are the result of socio\u2010cultural learning processes; these learning processes, which come about for historically contingent reasons, can be seen as developing the inherent logic of normative intuitions that are features of communication in all socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs. However, this qualification merely increases his burden of proof, for he now has to show not only that the normative intuitions in question are a feature of communication in general but also that there is an inherent logic to their development along the reflexive and universalist lines he describes. In his writings of the 1970s and 1980s Habermas held the view that reconstructive theories of individual moral development of the kind proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg could help him in this regard, while acknowledging that the difficulties involved in developing any such theory on a socio\u2010cultural level were considerable (see J. Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society, trans. T. McCarthy (London: Heinemann, 1979) and Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'). Since then, however, he has made no attempt to develop the required theory of socio\u2010cultural learning and has, moreover, expressed reservations about a number of fundamental aspects of Kohlberg's theory (see J. Habermas, 'A Philosophico\u2010Political Profile', in his Autonomy and Solidarity, ed. Peter Dews (London: Verso, 1986), pp. 149\u201389, here, p. 168 and J. Habermas, 'Lawrence Kohlberg and Neo\u2010Aristotelianism', in his Justification and Application: Remarks on Discourse Ethics, trans. C. Cronin (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993), pp. 113\u201332). For these reasons, I leave aside this complication in the following. 30 Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 29\u201338. To be sure, this constitutes an objection to his theory only in the absence of a theory of socio\u2010cultural learning that would show the idealizations in question to be the logical necessary development of normative intuitions that are features of communicative practices in general (see n. 29 above). 31 Seyla Benhabib makes this point with regard to the idealizing suppositions guiding moral argumentation in her Situating the Self (New York: Routledge, 1992), pp. 29\u201332. Cf. Cooke, Language and Reason, pp. 31\u20134. 32 See Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 150\u201362. 33 See Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, p. 109. Here he explicitly endorses the formal\u2010pragmatic justification of the moral principle of universalizability that he conducted in his earlier work. 34 In his writings subsequent to The Theory of Communicative Action there is some evidence that Habermas is prepared to accept that formal pragmatics provides only limited support for his concept of communicative rationality. Although he continues to affirm the importance of formal pragmatics as a justificatory strategy, on occasion he seems willing to admit that, on its own, formal pragmatics, cannot justify the emancipatory perspective offered by his critical social theory. See, for example, J. Habermas, 'A Genealogical Analysis of the Cognitive Content of Morality', in his The Inclusion of the Other, ed. C. Cronin and P. de Greiff (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000), pp. 3\u201346, here, p. 45. Furthermore, I discern evidence of an implicit acknowledgment of the limited justificatory power of formal pragmatics in Habermas's recent metatheoretical writings, in particular in the 'weak' naturalist argument he outlines in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1999), pp. 27\u201340. This argument aims to shed light on the question of how we can uphold a conception of objectivity notwithstanding the multiplicity and contingency of world\u2010generating grammars. In the course of the argument Habermas acknowledges his theory's reliance on the assumption that human beings unavoidably conceive of the progress of history as the possibility of learning. I regard this acknowledgment as a definite step in the right direction. See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'Socio\u2010Cultural Learning as a \"Transcendental\" Fact: Habermas's Postmetaphysical Perspective', International Journal of Philosophical Studies, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 63\u201383 and M. Cooke, 'Between \"Objectivism\" and \"Contextualism\": the Normative Foundations of Social Philosophy', Critical Horizons, 1 (2) (2000), pp. 193\u2013227. 35 See especially Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, Chs 7 and 8. 36 See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism: Habermas's Conception of Justice', European Journal of Political Theory, 2 (3) (2003), pp. 298\u2013300. 37 J. Rawls, Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993). It is noteworthy that Habermas criticizes (what I call) the radically contextualist aspect of Rawls's theory. See J. Habermas, 'Reconciliation through the Public Use of Reason: Remarks on John Rawls's Political Liberalism', Journal of Philosophy, 92 (3) (1995), pp. 109\u201331. Reprinted in Habermas, The Inclusion of the Other, pp. 49\u201373. 38 See nn 30 and 29 above. 39 Benhabib makes a similar point in her Situating the Self, p. 32. Indeed, the justificatory strategy I propose is similar to Benhabib's in a number of respects. The differences between our positions have to do with my proposed conceptualization of the idea of context\u2010transcending validity that is operative in argumentation. In M. Cooke, 'Habermas and Consensus', European Journal of Philosophy, 1 (3) (1993), pp. 247\u201367, I argue that this aspect of Benhabib's theory is underdeveloped. In Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 7, I make some concrete suggestions as to how it should be developed. 40 I develop it further in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 41 I develop it further ibid., Chs 1 and 2. 42 I discuss his theory of truth in some detail in M. Cooke, 'Habermas on Meaning and Truth', European Journal of Philosophy, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 1\u201323, in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism' and in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 5. 43 Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking, p. 8. 44 Ibid., p. 139. 45 It has been criticized, for example, for its restriction of moral discourse to discussion from the standpoint of the 'generalized other', neglecting the standpoint of the 'concrete other' (in Benhabib, Situating the Self, pp. 340\u20132); for its proposal that the idea of an agreement reached in an idealized process of moral discourse can be used as a standard for testing the validity of actual moral norms and principles (in A. Wellmer, 'Ethics and Dialogue', in his The Persistence of Modernity, trans. D. Midgley (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 1991), pp. 113\u2013231 and in C. Lafont, 'Realismus und Konstruktivismus in der kantianischen Moralphilosophie \u2013 das Beispiel der Diskursethik', Deutsche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Philosophie, 50 (1) (2002), pp. 39\u201352); and for making moral insight dependent on the exchange of arguments in moral discourse (in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', pp. 294\u20138). 46 Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Chs 5, 6 and 7. 47 See J. Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 271\u2013317, esp. 296\u2013301. 48 See Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit'. 49 J. Habermas, 'Einf\u00fchrung: Realismus nach der pragmatischen Wende', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 7\u201364, here, pp. 56\u201357; see also 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', esp. pp. 293\u20135. The German word normally used by Habermas is unverf\u00fcgbar. 50 The main elements of Habermas's revised theory of truth are set out in his 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit' and in his 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn'. 51 Judith Butler gives examples of ways in which the concept of universality has been vigorously contested, resulting in creative new articulations and restagings of it (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). Similarly, the concept of autonomy has been the subject of vigorous contestation and rearticulation. Even the concept of contestability can be the object of socio\u2010cultural learning: Albrecht Wellmer, for example, suggests that the question of which 'truths' can be contested is itself a contested matter, suggesting the need to reconsider the concept of contestability itself (see A. Wellmer, Sprachphilosophie (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2004), pp. 250\u201377). 52 See Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', and Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Ch. 7. 53 K. Marx, 'Theses on Feuerbach', in D. McLellan (ed.) Karl Marx: Selected Writings (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 156\u20138. 54 However, in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I argue that a non\u2010authoritarian conception of theory calls on critical social theory to rearticulate the traditional Marxian notion of praxis. 55 In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I suggest that contemporary critical social theories are well advised to give up the aspiration of providing a 'grand explanation' of what is wrong with the existing social order and to concentrate, instead, on analysing how the impediments to human flourishing are reproduced and disseminated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \"Public sphre\" is often used by historians of modern Latin America without much concern about its theoretical and methodological implications. Some historians have used it as a model to fit evidence about public debates and politics during the modern period, yet few have engaged it as a theory with deeper methodological and conceptual implications. This article will review the historical literature that has applied Habermas's ideas to Latin American history. Focusing on a few particularly important books, the article will examine potential avenues for research and comparisons. Rather than becoming a new orthodoxy for the study of the region, the theory of the public sphere is establishing a dialogue among historians interested in intellectual phenomena and political discourse (most of them centered on the history of liberalism after independence) and those historians whose interest in social formations have framed their study in terms of hegemony and class domination. The article will argue that a critical use of Habermas's ideas (one that is more systematic about the gender and class exclusions built into the bourgeois public sphere, and that problematizes the connections between the specific development of capitalism in peripheral regions and their embrace of European political traditions) could yield useful results in terms of new research and an inclusive synthesis of recent literature interested in politics, culture and hegemony in Latin America.

Other scholars, mentioned below, have already suggested the need to confront analyses based on Gramsci and Habermas. 8Habermas's initial definition is tentative and contains the diversity of issues outlined above: 'The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labour. The medium of this political confrontation was peculiar and without historical precedent: people's public use of their reason.' See Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27. See also J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article', New German Critique, iii (1974).

This parallels Benedict Anderson's claim that 'the convergence of capitalism and print technology \u2026 created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation', and his focus on American Creole identities as early examples of this process.

Concepts like el pueblo or lo p\u00fablico also had a history that illustrated the incorporation of traditional and modern notions, as explored by Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 'Reflexiones sobre la terminolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica del liberalismo' in Carlos Illades, Brian Connaughton and Sonia P\u00e9rez Toledo (eds), Construcci\u00f3n de la legitimidad pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico (Zamora, 1999). 20Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 30. See Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Penser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (Paris, 1978). For Palti, Guerra's use of Habermas lacked a 'strong' critique of the public-sphere model and failed to recognize Raymond Kosseleck's work as a necessary antecedent. Furet and Cochin were decisive in Guerra's work to strengthen that critique, without embracing 'las teor\u00edas multiculturalistas \"posmodernas\"'.

Guerra's emphasis on culture fits well with older visions of 'Latin American culture' as something clearly identifiable; for Edmundo O'Gorman, this common identity meant that the influence of the United States is negligible in the emergence of a Latin American political culture.

      "abstract": "In Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie (AGP), Habermas introduces Kierkegaard as a counterpoint to Hegel. Kierkegaard rejects Hegel's sublimation of subjectivity into ever-higher stages of knowledge, culminating in the absolute ego and a corresponding absolute knowledge, and asserts instead the importance of existentially lived truth (Habermas, 2019). Like Hegel, he conceives of reason as finite, operating within history, but unlike Hegel, attributes to it a transcending power that intervenes into the historical process. This power enables human subjects to act autonomously, liberating them to a mode of freedom that consists in 'being-able-to-be-oneself'. Habermas endorses Kierkegaard's concern to maintain the transcending power of reason as experienced by finite subjects within human history. However, he distances himself from his interpretation of existentially experienced truth as the authenticity [Wahrhaftigkeit] of a life of religious faith lived in passionate devotion (Habermas, 2019, pp. 670\u2013671). Rejecting his interpretation of the transcending power as the power of a personal God, Habermas offers a secular reading of it as the power of the anonymous Logos of language. On this reading, the ethical individual is offered not redemption but a postmetaphysical way out of its despairing isolation in self-referential inwardness (pp. 695\u2013696). In the following I reject both Habermas' secular, linguistic interpretation of the transcending power that liberates humans to be-able-to-be-themselves and Kierkegaard's religious one. Habermas' interpretation fails to accommodate the potentially language-transcending aspect of subjective experiences of existential truth, religious or non-religious. However, Kierkegaard's interpretation is also unsatisfactory, allowing for no rational contestation of the truth claims implicit in the subject's liberation to being-able-to-be-oneself; this renders it unsuitable for the purposes of critically engaged, political and social theorizing. Kierkegaard considers rational contestation impossible because individual subjects are unable to directly communicate their experiences of truth to their fellow subjects. In order for their experiences of truth to be accessible to other subjects, these subjects would have to undergo a personal conversion. Conversion is a revelatory experience. It reveals that being-able-to-be-oneself demands a fundamentally new mode of existence: one in which human subjects live in passionate religious devotion, attentive to the everyday conduct of their lives, deeply aware of their own sin and endeavouring to appropriate their life history reflexively (p. 672). In Kierkegaard's view, normal communication cannot convey the life-changing quality of this experience, since it is geared towards mutual comprehensibility within the terms of the prevailing ethical vocabulary (pp. 696\u2013697). Habermas notes an implicit truth reference in Kierkegaard's notion of passion; he observes that despite Kierkegaard's insistence that the leap of faith is not an epistemic act, it has a 'certain cognitive quality' (p. 675). However, due to the chasm he posits between faith and knowledge, the converted subjects' implicit claims to the truth of their new worldviews is immune to critical interrogation within everyday communicative practices. Habermas does not draw out an important implication of the truth dimension in conversion as Kierkegaard understands it. The fundamentally transformative character of the experience means that the subject's conversion results in a fundamentally new understanding of truth. For Kierkegaard, subjects who undergo conversion come to see that truth refers to the validity of an entire life-history; moreover, that truth can be grasped only through the reflexive appropriation of their own life-history in a mode of existence of passionate believing devotion to a personal God, who intervenes into, and operates within, human history (pp. 676\u2013677, p. 695). This new understanding of truth stands in stark contrast to the customary understanding of truth, in which it is a matter of the validity of factual or moral assertions. If the autonomous subject's fundamentally new worldview entails a fundamentally new way of conceiving truth, the challenges for intersubjective communication are even more serious than the obstacles to which Habermas draws attention. By dint of their if necessary rationally justified reference to the dogmatic authority of an inviolable core of infallible revealed truths, [religiously rooted existential convictions] evade that kind of unreserved discursive examination to which other ethical orientations and worldviews, i.e. secular 'conceptions of the good', are exposed (Habermas, 2008, p. 129). There is a sense in which Habermas is correct to say that existential convictions have a rationally impenetrable core. If one holds, as I do, that existential (ethical) truth always transcends its particular articulations, discursive critical reasoning will never be able fully to capture its meaning. Habermas goes a step further, however, drawing the conclusion that postmetaphysical thinking must abstain from evaluating the truth of religious convictions. This adds a second dimension to the ethical abstinence he identifies as a key component of postmetaphysical thinking in his earlier writings (Habermas, 1992). Ethical abstinence means, to begin with, that postmetaphysical philosophy does not offer substantive guidance for the existentially most important questions of human life (Habermas, 2003, pp. 12\u201317). In addition, it means that it should abstain from evaluating existentially rooted truth claims; these include religious ones, where it must adopt a stance of methodological atheism (Habermas, 1991, pp. 127\u2013156; 2008, pp. 209\u2013247). Put differently, he advocates critical restraint on the part of a reason that draws boundaries between moral knowledge and existential convictions on the grounds that 'we do not associate with value-orientations that have existential significance for us\u2026the claim that they merit universal recognition' (Habermas, 2008, pp. 239). His position in AGP remains unchanged: existential values, in contrast to moral norms and principles, cannot be justified with reasons that claim universal validity (Habermas, 2019, pp. 787\u2013788, p. 791). The second key component of postmetaphysical thinking is 'transcendence from within': an 'innerworldly', linguistic interpretation of the transcending power of truth claims in the domain of practical reason. Habermas calls this a deflationary account of the 'wholly other' or 'absolute'. It is deflationary because the emancipatory power of the absolute, which is deemed to be antecedent to, and foundational for, the subjectivity of speakers, is built into everyday intersubjective communication itself (Habermas, 2003, pp. 10\u201311; 2008, p. 242). In tacit agreement with Kierkegaard he holds that the idea of a transcendent power that breaks into the world from outside evades human understanding (Habermas, 2008, pp. 251\u2013252). In contrast to Kierkegaard, however, for whom emancipation is enabled by the passionately experienced truth of existentially rooted religious faith, for Habermas it is enabled by the binding and bonding power of the validity claims that human subjects mutually raise in communicating with one another, while accepting their rational responsibility to justify them if challenged (Habermas, 2003, pp. 10\u201311). In his deflationary account, this communicative power is the medium for a kind of transcendence that is generated by humans in their linguistic interactions and is, in this sense, 'innerworldly.' At the same time, it is truth-analogous, retaining the connotation of 'unconditionality' that we attach to the concept of truth (Habermas, 2019, p. 788, p. 789 n. 10). Accordingly, truth has a double aspect: it is at once unconditional and dependent on intersubjective justification. In the domain of morality Habermas makes truth (moral rightness) dependent on intersubjective justification in a generative sense: it is produced in (idealised) justificatory processes that culminate in rational agreement: only those norms and principles are morally valid that are the result of a universal agreement as to their universalizability, arrived at through the intersubjective exchange of reasons under ideal communicative conditions (Habermas, 2005, pp. 256\u201375). As he puts it: 'An agreement about norms or actions that is reached discursively under ideal conditions \u2026warrants [verb\u00fcrgt] the rightness of moral judgments. Ideal warranted assertibility is what we mean by moral validity\u2026it exhausts the meaning of normative rightness' (Habermas, 2005, p. 258, emphasis in original). In short, in the domain of practical reason, Habermas holds an epistemic-constructivist conception of truth (Cooke, 2016). In AGP Habermas offers a reconstruction of the historical emergence of postmetaphysical thinking that is significantly more differentiated than his earlier account; nonetheless, his conception itself remains substantively unchanged. As before, Habermas insists on postmetaphysical thinking's ethical abstinence and on the 'innerworldly' character of its transcending power. His understanding of both components leads to difficulties that endanger his project of a critical social theory (Cooke, 2013, 2016, 2019c). It impoverishes it by closing postmetaphysical thinking to religiously grounded and other ethical insights, for which in the given sociocultural context no generally acceptable reasons are available; these may nonetheless have illuminating power for humans concerned to live an ethically good life (Jaspers, 1967). In addition, it impacts negatively on its motivational force. If we assume that human agency is ethically inflected, permeated and shaped by more or less implicit orientations towards ideas of the good, then a theory calling for social and political change for the better must speak to humans as ethical, not just as moral and political agents. In a legal-political context, this would require it to make political legitimacy dependent on public discussion and contestation of ethical validity claims, irrespective of whether the reasons supporting them prove to be generally acceptable. Habermas' position here is ambivalent. On the one hand, he proposes a principle of democracy, according to which legitimacy is defined in terms of the assent of all citizens, discursively reached in a legally constituted process (Habermas, 1996, p. 110). In the secular, value-pluralist, societies of Western modernity, arriving at such agreement requires citizens to co-operate with their fellow citizens to translate the semantic contents of their metaphysically grounded religious worldviews into a generally acceptable language (Habermas, 2008). On the other hand, he acknowledges the need for citizens to work together to construct shared ideas of the good life and corresponding modes of behaviour and practices. Thus, in his Postscript to AGP, he draws attention to the need for socio-cultural learning processes that take place in the domain of ethical life as well as in the moral domain. He observes that in contemporary democratic contexts, in which there is an influx of immigrants with alien ways of thinking and unfamiliar life-practices, social integration calls not only for commitment to universal basic rights but also for the construction of intersubjectively shared value-orientations (Habermas, 2019, pp. 795\u2013796). While the final sentence of the Postscript recalls his argument for co-operative efforts at translation, I read his emphasis on constructing new meanings as a recognition that embracing metaphysically grounded or otherwise alien worldviews may require not just translation but fundamental identity-changes on the side of both secular and religious citizens. I suggest that critical social theory needs to probe the question of what such construction entails. In the following, I take some steps in this direction. I share Habermas' view that contemporary philosophy requires an appropriately re-articulated conception of autonomy; furthermore, that in contrast to Kierkegaard's idea of being-able-to-be-oneself, this cannot be based on the subject's recognition of its own dependency on an absolute power that escapes rational understanding. Habermas rightly ties autonomy to rational insight dependent on critical evaluation of validity claims in intersubjective processes of exchange and contestation. Building on Habermas' discourse-ethical approach, I construe autonomy as ethically self-determining agency: as a mode of freedom that is constituted in significant measure by way of the intersubjective exchange of reasons (Cooke, 2019b). In my account, however, the reasons exchanged are not just moral but also ethical ones, which relate to the validity of particular existential convictions. This leads me to sever the conceptual link Habermas posits between autonomy and discursively produced rational insight: For Habermas, moral autonomy is generated in discourses in which participants are concerned to reach a universally binding, rationally justified agreement about the universalizability of norms and principles (Cooke, 2020). Moral insight, as mentioned, is defined in epistemic-constructivist terms: agreement warrants the moral validity of norms and principles in a truth-analogous sense. The conceptual connection between autonomy and discursively generated rational insight means that Habermas cannot consistently hold a concept of ethical autonomy. For, in his discourse theory, participants in ethical discourses do not seek to arrive at a generally binding, rationally justified agreement that determines the validity of the judgment reached. Rather, they are concerned to gain clarity and a better understanding of their particular ideas of the good life (Habermas, 1993, pp. 1\u201318). The intersubjective exchange of reasons contributes to the hermeneutic process, providing help to participants in their concern to lead ethically good lives. Importantly, however, the validity of judgments reached is not determined by the intersubjective exchange of reasons. Thus, ethical discourses do not generate rational insight in a context-transcending, truth-analogous sense. Accordingly, Habermas could not offer a discourse-theoretical account of ethical autonomy without significant modification of his theory. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that he pays little attention to this form of freedom in his writings. That makes it all the more noteworthy that his dispute with Kierkegaard centres on a mode of ethical existence for which the term that Habermas makes the for the anonymous Logos of language as the transcending power that the individual from its self-referential liberating it to a of this is a form of but one that is from moral autonomy as Habermas it. The discursive processes that to the of freedom as being-able-to-be-oneself are concerned with questions such as should I conduct my life in the This is is well by the term I also share what I the of Habermas' postmetaphysical I read his of ethical abstinence as a of ethical This is my term for a mode of authority in which a view of the ethically good life is on individual subjects as valid (Cooke, pp. The subjects are the freedom to question the ethical validity of the form of life to which they are Ethical is with an of authority that asserts the truth of those to it the freedom to the validity of these (Cooke, pp. I read Habermas' of Kierkegaard's conception of truth from this as it stands Kierkegaard's position is not and ethically passionate religious do not seek to their view of truth, and the form of life appropriate to on those who have not to the religious they into However, his position has It such in a position of and ethical who have not the leap of faith and them of rational As Habermas being-able-to-be-oneself calls for responsibility not towards fellow humans but towards and the order of in which one and we may (Habermas, 2003, p.

In of these of between Habermas' postmetaphysical thinking and my own approach, do I reject his secular interpretation of Kierkegaard's transcending This is due to an implication of my conception of autonomy as ethically self-determining In my account, the subject's self-determining agency is constituted in significant measure in processes of rational and contestation with other human subjects, in which existential questions of the good life are at (Cooke, 2019b). The processes have an reference to truth, in the sense that those in them share a concern critically to and their particular existential convictions from the of view of their universal The exchange of reasons contributes to these and The concern critically to the universal validity of their particular existential convictions is shared by It the particular ethical questions in intersubjective in particular the to such particular questions are valid only for particular subjects in particular At in the critical however, the question of the universal validity of the ideas of the good life may to the a of discussion and contestation. has a emancipatory power for ethically self-determining agency as I of it. It is transcending because it agreement reached the validity of existential convictions. It is emancipatory because it potentially human subjects from the be these their own or the prevailing Thus, Kierkegaard and Habermas are to speak of power to the to a of However, I both from Kierkegaard's view that liberation is enabled by a religious faith that rational evaluation and Habermas' view that it is determined by the anonymous Logos of language. In with Habermas and Kierkegaard I hold that freedom as ethically self-determining agency requires individual subjects to adopt a reflexive to the existential convictions their everyday conduct of In addition, I share their view that such convictions are not subjective but have a reference they to ideas of the good for which subjects raise universal validity This them a In the domain of practical reason, truth as I construe it has a double aspect: it is at once and Habermas, I of it as in the sense that it human we must assume that we can never the truth whether this itself is character leads me to ethical as an intersubjective the truth of ideas of the good life is a concern shared by all human subjects, their evaluation calls on particular subjects to critically with other human subjects, no in principle on those with whom they are to While the intersubjective step in my account does not from the aspect of ethical truth, there are based on and autonomy for this (Cooke, second aspect is ethical truth as I construe it is by and individual there is no we must assume that ethical can lead to to questions that to truth otherwise rational on would be (Cooke, pp. I furthermore, that the of ethical truth claims requires processes of intersubjective and in which all seek to the ethically in a sense (Cooke, pp. In the societies of democratic ideas of the good life are and In all other subjects are in principle as in ethical on ethical such The subjects critically with their own ethical in to they with no of mutual understanding.

To deal with these paradoxes, this book looks at participation as a structurally unstable concept and as the object of a political-ideological struggle that makes it oscillate between minimalist and maximalist versions. This struggle is analysed in theoretical reflections in five fields (democracy, arts, development, spatial planning and media) and in eight different cases of media practice.

Basic rights are reciprocally and generally justifiable and binding claims on others (agents or institutions) that they should do (or refrain from doing) certain things determined by the content of these rights. We call these rights basic because they define the status of persons as full members of a normative order in such a way that they provide protection from severe forms of legal, political and social domination. The very ground of these rights is the status of persons as free and equal normative authorities within the order they are subject to. In other words, these rights are grounded in a fundamental moral right to justification.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Power in communication takes two main forms. As \u2018external\u2019 power, it consists in the ability to acknowledge or disregard a speaker or a discourse. As \u2018internal\u2019 power, it is the ability of an argument to eliminate other arguments by demonstrating its superiority. A positive or negative value may be ascribed to these forms of power. Four ideal\u2010typical positions are discussed \u2013 strategy, technocracy, constructionism, and deliberation. Public deliberation has three virtues \u2013 civic virtue, governance virtue and cognitive virtue. Deliberation lowers the propensity to, and the benefit of, strategic behaviour. It also increases knowledge, enhancing the quality of decisions. For Habermas, the unity of reason is expressed in the possibility of agreement on the most convincing argument. However, sometimes conflicts are deeplying, principles and factual descriptions are profoundly different, and uncertainty is radical. The best argument cannot be found. There is no universal reason. The question is whether non\u2010strategic agreement may spring from the incommensurability of languages. In search of an answer, Rawls's concept of overlapping consensus, the feminist theory of the public sphere, and the idea of deliberation as co\u2010operation are discussed. The argument developed is that the approach to deliberative democracy may be renewed by rethinking its motivational and cognitive elements. Public deliberation is grounded on a pre\u2010political level of co\u2010operation. Intractable controversies may be faced at the level of practices, looking for local, contextual answers.",

A range of criticisms are discussed which target the underlying premises, the analytical methodology and the disputed areas of reader response and the integration of contextual factors. Controversial issues such as the predominantly negative focus of much CDA scholarship, and the status of CDA as an emergent \u201cintellectual orthodoxy\u201d, are also reviewed. The conclusions offer a summary of the principal criticisms that emerge from this overview, and suggest some ways in which these problems could be attenuated.",

      "abstract": "Social media has become a key term in Media and Communication Studies and public discourse for characterising platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, Wordpress, Blogspot, Weibo, Pinterest, Foursquare and Tumblr. This paper discusses the role of the concept of the public sphere for understanding social media critically. It argues against an idealistic interpretation of Habermas and for a cultural-materialist understanding of the public sphere concept that is grounded in political economy. It sets out that Habermas\u2019 original notion should best be understood as a method of immanent critique that critically scrutinises limits of the media and culture grounded in power relations and political economy. The paper introduces a theoretical model of public service media that it uses as foundation for identifying three antagonisms of the contemporary social media sphere in the realms of the economy, the state and civil society. It concludes that these limits can only be overcome if the colonisation of the social media lifeworld is countered politically so that social media and the Internet become public service and commons-based media.Acknowledgement: This paper is the extended version of Christian Fuchs\u2019 inaugural lecture for his professorship of social media at the University of Westminster that he took up on February 1st, 2013.

      "abstract": "Planning theory has shifted over time in response to changes in broader social and philosophical theory as well as changes in the material world. Postmodernism and poststructuralism dislodged modernist, rational and technical approaches to planning. Consensualist decision-making theories of the 1980s took forms of communicative and collaborative planning, drawing on Habermasian concepts of power and society. These positions, along with refinements and critiques within the field, have been hegemonic in planning theory ever since. They are, in most cases, presented at a high level of abstraction, make little reference to the political and social contexts in which they are based, and hold an unspoken assumption that they are of universal value, i.e. valid everywhere. Not only does this suggest important research methodology errors but it also renders these theories of little use in those parts of the world which are contextually very different from theory origin\u2014in most cases, the global North. A more recent \u2018southern turn\u2019 across a range of social science disciplines, and in planning theory, suggests the possibility of a foundational shift toward theories which acknowledge their situatedness in time and place, and which recognize that extensive global difference in cities and regions renders universalized theorising and narrow conceptual models (especially in planning theory, given its relevance for practice) as invalid. New southern theorising in planning is drawing on a range of ideas on societal conflict, informality, identity and ethnicity. Postcolonialism and coloniality have provided a useful frame for situating places historically and geographically in relation to the rest of the world. However, the newness of these explorations still warrants the labelling of this shift as a \u2018southern theorizing project\u2019 in planning rather than a suggestion that southern planning theory has emerged.",

Using alternative rationality assumptions, such as bounded rationality, irrationality, substantive rationality and the notion of rationality as a social construct, we conceptualise impression management in alternative ways as (1) self-serving bias, (2) symbolic management and (3) accounting rhetoric. This contributes to an enhanced understanding of impression management in a corporate reporting context.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. For more than 30 years, critical research in information systems (IS) has challenged the assumption that technology innovation is inherently desirable and hence to the benefit of all. Nevertheless, how researchers view the nature of being critical has changed over time, and so too have the ways that they pursue their critical agenda and argue for their contributions. In this paper, I present a brief historical account of critical IS research, tracing the theoretical perspectives that have been dominant at different times and the empirical efforts that were guided by them. As part of tracing our current position I examine two key texts authored by Chrisanthi Avgerou and Geoff Walsham, who pursue different types of critical agenda and make distinctive empirically based contributions concerning the substantive issue of global diversity in IS innovation and its consequences. Overall, I suggest that the IS field now accepts broad definitions of the nature of being critical, but despite having a body of empirical critical research from which to learn, we are not making the most of our opportunities to do so, which retards further development. While I do not seek to develop a prescription for conducting and evaluating critical research, or try to encourage lengthy confessional accounts of research conduct in all journal papers, I do argue that we need more explicit reflections about our sustained long\u2010term efforts in the field. Such reflections might consider the way we develop our critical arguments and insights, and what we strive for and accomplish through our interventions. In effect, the IS field has not yet reached a position where the theory and practice of doing critical research are informing each other.",

Feminism and constructivism share a commitment to an ontology of becoming that can serve as a common basis for conversation. Yet there are also profound differences between feminists and constructivists. First, most IR feminists approach gender and power as integral elements in processes of construction, whereas most constructivists consider power to be external to such processes. This failure to conceptualize power and gender as social and pervasive leads constructivists to miss an important part of the empirical reality of power politics. Second, constructivists tend to ignore the implications of a postpositivist epistemology, whereas for feminists the question of \"Who knows?\" is crucial. We argue that the constructivist failure to problematize the research process as a social (and therefore political) process of construction is logically inconsistent with an ontology of becoming. We introduce empirical materials to illustrate the advantages of feminist approaches. We hope to advance a dialogue between feminism and constructivism because the two approaches add to each other and in combination can yield better theoretical and empirical understandings of the world.",

We argue that a sensemaking approach is useful for examining how ethical truces emerge in equivocal situations. To understand how actors navigate through ethical complexity, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry into the multistakeholder practices of setting Fairtrade Minimum Prices. We offer three contributions. First, we develop a process model of ethics as sensemaking that explains how actors come to collectively agree on what is ethical in complex situations, even if no complete consensus arises. Second, our findings suggest that moral intuition and affect also motivate ethical judgment alongside moral reasoning. Third, an ethical sensemaking perspective explains some of the pitfalls actors confront in coping with ethical complexities in practice and how they attend to the challenges arising from stark inequalities in extreme contexts.",

We know scale by many names and through many familiar antinomies: local and global, micro and macro events. Even the most critical among us often proceed with our analysis as if such scales were the ready-made platforms of social life, rather than asking how, why, and to what effect are scalar distinctions forged in the first place. How do scalar distinctions help actors and analysts alike make sense of and navigate their social worlds? What do these distinctions reveal and what do they conceal? How are scales construed and what effects do they have on the way those who abide by them think and act? This pathbreaking volume attends to the practical labor of scale-making and the communicative practices this labor requires. From an ethnographic perspective, the authors demonstrate that scale is practice and process before it becomes product, whether in the work of projecting the commons, claiming access to the big picture, or scaling the seriousness of a crime. \u201cHow shall we fathom the world, bringing its varied scales into analytic perspective? The authors collected in this bold and subtle volume slow down the question, arguing that \u2018scale\u2019 is made, not born, and that \u2018perspectives\u2019 are semiotic accomplishments and not stable points of anchor.\u201d -STEFAN HELMREICH, Elting E.

More specifically, the study aims to demonstrate that, whilst Habermas\u2019s approach succeeds in offering useful insights into the structural transformation of the public sphere in the early modern period, it does not provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding the structural transformation of public spheres in late modern societies. To the extent that the gradual differentiation of social life manifests itself in the proliferation of multiple public spheres, a critical theory of public normativity needs to confront the challenges posed by the material and ideological complexity of late modernity in order to account for the polycentric nature of advanced societies. With the aim of showing this, the paper is divided into three sections. The first section elucidates the sociological meaning of the public/private dichotomy. The second section scrutinizes the key features of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere by reflecting on (i) the concept of the public sphere, (ii) the normative specificity of the bourgeois public sphere, and (iii) the structural transformation of the public sphere in modern society. The third section explores the most substantial shortcomings of Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere, particularly its inability to explain the historical emergence and political function of differentiated public spheres in advanced societies.",

A response to some of these other critics will appear in the fall issue of Perspectives, the newsletter of the ASA theory section, and another response, to an essay review by Bryan Turner, will appear in a forthcoming issue of Citizenship Studies.2 \"Much of contemporary political science,\" Elizabeth Clemens relates, \"has refuted just this framing, arguing that political actors can be understood as consistently rational, but honest, cooperative and trustworthy only when it advances their self-interest,\" and she concludes by complaining (or exclaiming\u2014it is hard to tell whether she is being ironic or not), \"yet Alexander rejects this standard assumption of political theory.\" It seems to me, however, that rat choice in political science, or sociology for that matter, validates rather than falsifies the theory of civil binaries that I have proposed. In fact, not only does rat choice confirm the distinctively binary nature of lay and philosophical thinking about democracy and politics, but it quite neatly fits into one of its sides. A theoretical version of what I call the tradition of Thracymachus it offers the kind of narrow instrumental approach to rationality that Socrates attacked in Plato's dialogues\u2014concerned with means, not ends; aggressive, not cooperative; manipulative, not straightforward; and without consideration for the values of others, unless such concern is to serve our side.3 Two articles I published on the Watergate crisis (CitationAlexander 1984, Citation1988) straddle the pre- and post-semiotic divide. The first was organized around the universalism/particularism contrast, while the second proposes the idea of more complex sets of binaries, although not yet the idea of the discourse of civil society. The notion of cultural discourse as a relational language built on self-generating antonyms bears a family resemblance, not only to the late Durkheim and semiotics, but also to Foucault's post-structural understanding. In History of Sexuality, Foucault maintained that the Victorian discourse of repression was paradoxically implied by the anti-Victorian discourse of sexual liberation, such that the latter was not, in fact, \"repression free.\" My sense that the discourse of civil society is similarly divided, that it similarly interpolates each side with the other, led me to adapt Foucault's notions of a simultaneously repressive and \"liberating\" discourse from the sexual to the political scene. All of this is recounted in The Civil Sphere and elsewhere in the publications that are cited there. My point is that the discourse of civil emancipation also speaks the language of exclusion, often doing so with the heartfelt intention of protecting democracy from its enemies and even, sometimes, from itself. It can hardly be the case, then, that I conceptualize the codes of civil society, pace Antonio, as fostering \"uncontested integration.\" This is Habermas' discourse ethics, not mine.4 I also noted CitationBaiocchi's (2006) research on the emergence of the discourse of civil society in Brazil's transition from authoritarianism and CitationHeins' (2006) on how the civil binaries have distorted some recent European intellectual discourse about America. For a historical investigation of the codes as structuring class conflicts in late 18th-century London, see CitationDavis (2007).5 At one point, Antonio implies that, while the quotations reproduced in The Civil Sphere do suggest binarism, they do not display the actual language terms that I attribute to the discourse of civil society. If this were so, it would certainly be a telling critique. I believe, to the contrary, that each quotation contains one or more of the civil binaries that compose the broader culture structure. This, at least, was my selection criterion for including a quotation. I briefly considered italicizing the actual items of the civil language inside each quoted text, but I decided this would be unnecessarily didactic and disruptive.6 As evidence for his assertion that \"the connection between Alexander and Parsons is transparent,\" Antonio suggests that my \"strong claims\" about the civil codes actually \"stand in for Parsons' evolutionary\" theory. My discussion in the text above explains why this is not true. From the time when I first conceptualized these binaries as coded languages, I saw them as standing in marked tension, if not, in fact, as refuting, Parsons' cultural theory; when I conceptualized the irredeemable contradictions of the civil sphere, I understood myself to be falsifying the evolutionary optimism of modernization theory in general and Parsons' social and historical work in particular. My strong sense that Parsons had papered over the contradictory tensions between the subsystems (for him, AGIL), and overemphasized their complementary, was already very much part of Theoretical Logic, informing most of the second half of the fourth volume of that book (CitationAlexander 1983). As I developed my civil sphere theory, I devoted a large chunk of the concluding chapter of Neofunctionalism and After (CitationAlexander 1997) to a critique of Parsons' understanding of \"societal community.\" More recently, in a more polemical essay (CitationAlexander 2005b), I demonstrate how Parsons' commitment to evolution allowed him not to face the dark sides of modernity, but to pretend, instead, that contemporary American society either had already, or was about to, fulfill itself in an ideal way.7 In his powerful and disturbing book, CitationJames B. McKee (1993) has shown how just such a delegitimating binary distorted the history of American sociological studies of race, typically reducing African Americans to creatures without the capacity to participate in modern society in order to explain, if not to justify, centuries of white rule. In an article building upon McKee, CitationMorris (2007:529) describes these \"prescientific assumptions\" in binary terms and attributes to them great symbolic power: \"They led White sociologists to formulate two contrasting sociological populations: Whites were civilized, endowed with agency, and superior; blacks were subhuman, bereft of agency, and inferior.\"8 Indeed, my point in stressing the centrality of mutual recognition and misrecognition is not only empirical but moral. Only by insisting on widespread human capacity can we avoid the simplifying dichotomies upon which civil restrictions rest. If we fight a revolution that dichotomizes humane friend and inhumane foe, how will we create a human and inclusive society afterward? Who will educate the educators, as Marx once asked? The 20th century is strewn with the rotting carcasses of would-be liberators\u2014revolutions built upon dichotomizing rhetorics that have refused to recognize the humanity of fellow human beings.9 It is just such a philosophical anthropology of recognition that Hegel laid out in Phenomenology of Mind and that, via Hegel, informs such contemporary philosophers as Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth. For a critique, see CitationAlexander and Lara (1996).10 The transformation of the form of women's organizations from \"womanly\" clubs to more impersonal business models, which Clemens documents in her book, The People's Lobby (CitationClemens 1997:184\u2013234), illustrates how one of these nontraumatic pathways of change facilitated the civil incorporation of women. While emphasizing organizational repertoires rather than cultural structures, Clemens implicitly evokes a performative understanding, writing that \"by adopting techniques not traditionally associated with feminine activity, women sought to present themselves as legitimate political actors\" (p. 207, italics added), and noting how, in the newly adopted organizational forms, \"cash served both as a symbol of citizenship and as a medium of centralization\" (p. 213). In her critical comment, Clemens acknowledges that in \"cultivating greater communicative capacities and political development,\" even the more conservative first-wave feminists \"deployed multiple substantive identities [that] can be arrayed as a series of overlain binaries in order to suggest a powerful, structuring, underlying code.\" I agree with Clemens that the continuing evocation of civil binaries neither reinforced purely traditional inequalities of gender nor introduced postgender criteria for evaluating women as citizens\u2014which is precisely why, throughout my historical reconstruction of the shifting relation of gender and civil sphere, I employ the concept of \"compromise formation.\"11 At various points in The Civil Sphere, I directly challenge Morris's (1984) account in theoretical and empirical terms, for example, footnote 33, pp. 637\u201341, where I also contest other instrumentalist explanations, including the emphasis on the Cold War and claims that white accessions at Birmingham and elsewhere were responses simply to local white businessmen's fears over profit loss (see below).12 In Sociology and the Race Problem, McKee argues that the racist distortion of black capacities (see note 7, above) explains why, before the 1960s, white American sociologists either dismissed the possibility for reform or adopted a paternalistic, white man's burden position. \"A people so culturally inferior,\" McKee explains, \"would lack the capability to advance their own interests by rational action.\" As blacks were \"viewed as lacking a trained and experienced leadership, as still ignorant and mostly uneducated,\" they were portrayed \"as incapable of participating in the political process.\" In other words, the failure to recognize black agency \"was a logical extension of this image of the American black\" (CitationMcKee 1993:8). Only with the antiracist reconstruction of the white political imagination, which was both cause and effect of the civil rights movement, could this serious misunderstanding begin to change, and white American sociology commence to give the power and the resources of the black civil sphere their due. In the final pages of The Civil Sphere's analysis of the civil rights movement, I speculate that the significance of black agency in the contemporary project of civil repair has, perhaps, still not been fully appreciated: \"Despite the periodic calls for regulatory intervention made by liberal intellectuals and policy elites, the conditions that sustain the racial underclass will not be repaired until a new social movement can arise. Only a powerful and affecting social movement could mobilize the increasingly fragmented black community. Only skillful movement intellectuals could translate the particular experiences and conditions of the racial underclass into compelling codes and narratives that can gain psychological identification from the civil sphere outside. Social scientists and critics speak about repairing this new racial divide primarily in organizational terms, calling for massive state intervention and economic restructuring. However, such new forms of regulation depend on the creation of new forms of civil power\" (The Civil Sphere, p. 390).13 That, nonetheless, throughout much of the decades-long backlash period, civil repair of racial (and gender and sexual) inequality actually gained momentum demonstrates the manner in which regulative institutions of civil society respond to communicative restructurings of social solidarity, and not simply to the strategic maneuverings of election fights. This momentum did not, however, ameliorate the problem of the racial underclass.14 It is, in fact, the central importance of these northern media, not the fact that some of their best reporters were of southern origins, that is the central point of Roberts and Klibanoff's The Race Beat. This position actually provides the dramatic conclusion of their book, where they draw from their interviews with John Lewis, the Congressman and former movement activist: \"When he looks back on how he survived and how the movement kept going, he thinks about how hard the segregationists worked to keep the prying eyes of the press away. He can recall the security he felt when reporters\u2014'sympathetic referees,' he calls them\u2014were watching and the fear he felt when they weren't\u2026. When he saw white thugs in Montgomery smash cameras, beat reporters, and rip up notebooks, he understand that there was an extraordinary power of communications operating parallel to, and intertwined with, the movement. It was, he felt, an allied force[:] 'There was a sense of righteous indignation on the part of the American people because of the message that the media was able to translate and send around the country and around the world'\" (CitationRoberts and Klibanoff 2006:407). Lewis is speaking here, of course, only about northern media. Roberts and Klibanoff document how southern media, with a few notable exceptions, \"threw their whole editorial weight\" behind the backlash that developed against the black movement in the South (p. 74).15 All following quotations from CitationTavernise (2007).",

Specifically, I argue that these concepts have come to function in a normalizing manner. I outline Michel Foucault\u2019s thinking on the norm and normalization and then provide an overview of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s thinking on the norm and normativity in order to show that Habermas\u2019s conceptualizations of the norm and normativity are not, as he posits, necessary foundations for ethics and politics, but in fact simply one philosophical approach among many. Uncritically accepting a Habermasian framework therefore produces normalizing effects and inhibits alternative and potentially emancipatory thinking about ethics and politics. Having problematized the requirement of normative foundations as it is currently articulated, I conclude by examining the emancipatory potential of a particular aspect of Foucault\u2019s work for the practice of philosophy.",

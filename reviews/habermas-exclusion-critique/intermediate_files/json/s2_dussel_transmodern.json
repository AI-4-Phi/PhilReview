It explores the theoretical shift ushered in by Transmodernity and the repercussions this may have for texts like Cole\u2019s \u2013literary works that address the shortcomings of the Eurocentric world-system and scrutinize the implications of globalization for paramodern cultures\u2013 using Enrique Dussel\u2019s terminology (2012). By focusing on the text\u2019s approach to genre and intermediality, conflicted narrative voice, and depiction of transnational fluxes, I seek to chart the ways in which the narrative exposes and undermines Western epistemic domination, while pushing new ways of seeing and thinking aligned with the transmodern paradigm.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines the alternative global consciousness envisioned in Karen Tei Yamashita\u2019s Tropic of Orange, arguing that the novel intertwines reparative decolonization with a critique of neoliberal globalization through a framework of critical global inter connectivity. At the crux of the novel\u2019s discourse is a polemic against neoliberalism, which it presents as a contemporary manifestation of colonial modernity. Engaging with Enrique Dussel\u2019s philosophy of \u2018transmodernism\u2019, this study explores Tropic of Orange as a counternarrative that interrogates both the enduring legacies of colonial modernity and the exploitative structures of global capitalism. Attuned to a Dusselian (re)vision of world order, which foregrounds the resurgence of marginalized epistemologies while eschewing cultural apologism, this article examines the novel\u2019s reclamation of myth, enchantment and cyclic temporality. It further contends that Yamashita envisions collective agency as an embodied, transnational praxis that transcends conventional geopolitical binaries by amplifying indigenous and diasporic epistemologies and fostering transversal connections that operate both intra-South and across South-North axes.",

      "abstract": "The goal of the present paper is to establish a parallel between the ethical perspectives presented by Dussel and Habermas and, from these assumptions, to argue if the universal consensus meets the citizenship demands of the Latin American man. On the one hand, Dussel starts from a responsible exegesis of Marxian writings which, purged in the light of third world demands, leads to the idea of praxis as the path to man's self-liberation. It is, in fact, a loosening of the Europeanist aspect of the critique of the nineteen hundred, in order to create, through social work, the disalienation. On the other hand, although Habermas shows some sensitivity to the problem of man excluded by capital relations, his universalism is attached to the old world. It is therefore necessary to ask whether this whole theoretical building is sufficient to meet the emancipation needs of the third world man. Such an analysis leads us, certainly, to the concept of utopia, so dear to Dussel, thematized as a space yet to happen, as a possibility for the realization of man. Aspect that for Habermas is linked to the future as a construction of democracy.",

The piece concludes with an analysis of two films with an ecological focus, Trolljegeren/Troll Hunter (2010) and The Hunter (2011). They are indicative of a much broader emerging trend in ecocinema that explores the interaction between humanity and the environment in relation to world history, and which does so by staging encounters between people and those \u2018nonhuman\u2019 aspects of the Earth excluded by coloniality/modernity (e.g. animals, animal-spirits, mythological creatures, shaman, the very Earth itself). The interdisciplinary concerns of this work place it at the intersection of the latest research into a world of cinemas (in particular the various moves to understand films beyond the national paradigm now increasingly labelled the \u2018transnational turn\u2019; alongside growing concerns with how cinema helps us engage with ecology); and the ne...",

Yet little critical attention has been devoted to systematically connect or compare these two powerful ideological formations. This essay attempts to fill this gap by delinking the Indian Dalit thinker B. R. Ambedkar from the theoretical discourses of postcolonialism and postmodernism, and linking him to the decolonial framework of transmodernism developed by Latin American liberation philosopher Enrique Dussel. Framing the affiliation between Ambedkar and Dussel in terms of ideological similarity and political solidarity, I present Ambedkar as a transmodern thinker who precedes and exceeds Dussel, placing him at the head of a global vanguard fighting to lay the epistemological foundation for a critical universal enlightenment.",

Transmodernity is a decolonial project proposed by Enrique Dussel in 1994. Modernity, defined as a sacrificial myth -eurocentric, colonizing, and capitalist- would be overcome from the moment in which it is possible to affirm the otherness of the universal cultures \u2014ana- lectic\u2014. Such a project of the Philosophy of Liberation can be conceived as a method that would take the best of modernity \u2014its rational character\u2014, but in an opposite sense to political, cultural, and economic domination. Gastro-G\u00f3mez assumes this method to propose a transmodern republicanism. In this text, the possible modernity/ coloniality dialog, corroborated by these two philosophers, will be established as the guiding thread to determine how a new way of understanding the ontology of eman- cipatory (not liberating) politics, presented by the Colombian philosopher, is possible.",

In all three cases, issues like multiplicity, connectedness and a sense of motility are present. And, the article proves, they prove valid to render the aesthetic, ethical and political possibilities of contemporary texts that range from literature, Damon Galgut\u2019s In a Strange Room (2010), to music, Hozier\u2019s hit \u201cTake me to Church\u201d (2014), and to cinema, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Babel (2006).1",

      "abstract": "Summary The article focuses on Enrique Dussel's Philosophy of Liberation, with the aim of reflecting on the articulation between modernity, the Eurocentric paradigm and the world paradigm. In this sense, the article develops the discussion on rationality and irrationality of modernity (myth of modernity) and its transmodernity (overcoming), as it is directly related to the question of the negative dialectical method with the negation of otherness - of indigenous populations - in philosophical systems. Eurocentric totality and points out the analytical movement as overcoming, expanding and liberating the negative dialectical method. It also outlines the intercultural philosophy of Raul Fornet-Betancourt, which aims at a symmetrical dialogue between philosophical knowledge. It is inferred, from the Liberation of the Other as Alterity and Interculturality, the concrete existence of a dialogical relationship between philosophical knowledge, enabling greater cosmological, philosophical and educational enrichment, as well as the teaching of intercultural philosophy in indigenous schools. In this study, the bibliographic review is the methodological strategy used.",

      "abstract": "This text belongs to the field of Latin American studies and, more specifically, affirm the Philosophy of Liberation as its ethical fundament. It affirms the adoption of an anti-management attitude because the distinction between Northern/Southern management is irrelevant for the victims. Quijano\u2019s coloniality of power and Dussel\u2019s transmodernity \u00a0are introduced because they open possibilities for a politicized discussion that goes beyond culturalism and indicate the need of transcending the globalized power of capitalist power as an indispensable condition for the liberation of the victims of this system of power. Follows a critical appraisal of postcolonial studies and a brief overview of its presence in the field of MOS. Finally, the argument for the need of an anti-management perspective is presented.",

      "abstract": "The article considers J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s views on the relationship between postmetaphysical philosophy and religion. It outlines Habermas\u2019s shift from his earlier, apparently dismissive attitude towards religion to his presently more receptive stance. This more receptive stance is evident in his recent emphasis on critical engagement with the semantic contents of religion and may be characterized by two interrelated theses: (a) the view that religious contributions should be included in political deliberations in the informally organized public spheres of contemporary democracies, though translated into a secular language for the purposes of legislation and formal decision making and (b) the view that postmetaphysical philosophy should seek to salvage the semantic contents of religious traditions in order to supply the evocative images, exemplary figures, and inspirational narratives it needs for its social and political projects. With regard to (a), it argues that the translation requirement impairs the political autonomy of religious believers and other metaphysically inclined citizens, suggesting that this difficulty could be alleviated by making a distinction between epistemologically authoritarian and non-authoritarian religious beliefs. With regard to (b), it argues that the salvaging operation is not as straightforward as Habermas seems to suppose and that social and political philosophy may not be able to tap the semantic power of religious traditions without relying on metaphysical assumptions; it concludes that, here, too, a distinction between authoritarian and non-authoritarian approaches to knowledge and validity may be useful.",

However, the role of NGO legitimacy in such partnerships has thus far been neglected. We argue that NGOs assume a status as special stakeholders of corporations which act on behalf of the common good. This role requires a particular focus on their moral legitimacy. We introduce a conceptual framework for analysing the moral legitimacy of NGOs along three dimensions, building on the theory of deliberative democracy. Against this background we outline three procedural characteristics which are essential for judging the legitimacy of NGOs as potential or actual partners of corporations.",

These core matters of identity and selfhood are approached through both Medium Theory and the philosophical frameworks of phenomenology and Kantian and feminist ethics. Together these perspectives foreground important correlations between media usages, selfhood, and our preferred political and social arrangements. And, as indexed by changing practices and theories of \u201cprivacy\u201d, Western societies are shifting from individual-rational notions of selfhood, as these have correlated with the emancipatory politics of democratic processes and norms, including equality\u2014towards more relational-affective notions of selfhood. Historically, relational-affective selves correlate with non-democratic regimes and hierarchical societies. Hence a core question emerges: how far do these shifts towards more relational-affective selves imply a loss of democratic processes and norms? I explore this question by way of recent empirical and philosophical work that suggests that individual notions of selfhood may well survive in an age of (analogue-) digital media. Nonetheless, taking Confucian models of democracy, as resting on relational notions of selfhood, as examples\u2014the democratic norm of equality is threatened. I conclude by arguing that our media choices and thus the kinds of selves we thereby choose to cultivate will determine in large measure whether our future societies will be more democratic or non-democratic, and more egalitarian or non-egalitarian.",

I will claim more than this, however. In forcing reflection upon these assumptions, Habermas challenges the possibility of the relationship between philosophy and politics that Rawls assumes. This notwithstanding, there are significant obstacles to matching up, let alone arbitrating between, the respective claims of Rawls and Habermas. One point of entry into the issue of procedural versus substantive approaches on which I focus is the fact that Rawls and Habermas mean different things by the term \"justice.\"",

This may lead to undesirable gaps in the distribution of responsibilities. In this paper, a procedural model is developed for alleviating the tension between diverging responsibility conceptions. The model is based on the Rawlsian approach of wide reflective equilibrium and overlapping consensus. The model is applied to a technological project, which concerned the development of an in-house monitoring system based on ambient technology. The development of this innovative technology raised questions among the technological researchers about its social acceptance and the way issues related to privacy and security should be addressed. The case is analyzed in terms of two procedural norms (reflective learning and inclusiveness), which are based on literature on policy and innovation networks. Analysis of the case shows that, in a pluralist setting, a procedural approach can be useful for encouraging discussion on the legitimacy of different responsibility conceptions and the question what a fair responsibility distribution amounts to.",

Cosmopolitanism\u2019s recognition of shared humanity and the subsequent entailment of democratic inclusion make explicit the moral and political nature of cosmopolitan education and philosophy. As an ethico-political process, existing political and ethical processes can be brought to bear on its educational manifestations. The political concepts of epistemological restraint, discourse ethics, and agonistic pluralism are offered as models for cosmopolitan education in agonistic morality: epistemological restraint is used to address the need for prioritization of moral inquiry over moral belief; discourse ethics addresses the necessity of inclusive and democratic dialogue; agonistic pluralism offsets the implications of the inevitability of pluralism in educational inquiry. All three combine to form a process of cosmopolitan education in agonistic morality.",

Further, I approach the problem of democratic legitimacy and delineate two \\nalternative readings of deliberative democracy \u2013 the \u2018rationalistic\u2019 and the \u2018participatory\u2019 one. \\nThen I address Habermas\u2019 epistemic account of the moral value of democratic procedures \\nand the problem this poses for a viable conception of democratic legitimacy. I make the case \\nfor a weaker form of consensus as the criterion of democratic legitimacy - a working \\nagreement resting upon different, but reasonable reasons.",

The interpretation proceeds in three steps. First, the idea of public reason and discourse is analyzed, followed by an explanation of democratic deficit and of the social deficit in the second and third steps, respectively. These deficits are analyzed as an essential limit to political and social conditions of the participation of citizens. The analysis focuses thereby on the theory of public reason by one of the most influential political philosophers of the last decades, John Rawls. The paper identifies two main pitfalls in his theory: first, the deficit following from an inadequate integration of an individual into society, which, in this case, represents democratic deficit, second, the deficit linked with underrating the socio-distributive dimension of justice, which means a social deficit.",

From a communicative action perspective, we argue that Habermas\u2019s conceptions of speech conditions and validity conditions can be used to evaluate the discursive and substantive dimensions of procedural justice in deliberation. That is, fair deliberation is built on the fulfillment of discourse norms and the communicativeness of dialogic interactions. The communicative measures are compatible with extant procedural justice measures and provide a communication-centered ground for evaluating deliberative outcomes related to procedural justice. The case study involves public discussion of the Singaporean government\u2019s population policies on an online deliberative platform. The results show that when procedural justice is presented in the realization of both speech conditions and validity conditions, it fosters participants\u2019 beliefs in the rightfulness of deliberative policymaking. Additionally, speech conditions play a more important role than validity conditions in predicting citizens\u2019 specific policy support after online deliberation. The findings illustrate one instance of how communicative norms are prioritized in different deliberative settings and what deliberative benefits a fair procedure can achieve. The results shed light on the theorization of procedural justice and advance the extant knowledge of evaluating procedural justice in deliberation.",

The paper concludes with the argument that Habermas' approach is conceptually more sophisticated and practically more relevant when compared with the other two, and, as such, it offers a more promising solution to the problem at hand.",

The goal of this dissertation is to\\n expand democratic theory, by comparing and contrasting two of the most important contemporary\\n paradigms of democratic thought: the theory of deliberative democracy and the theory of\\n populist democracy. The dissertation asserts that the deliberative democratic theory does not\\n discuss the issue of power as thoroughly as it should, and that it does not treat the matter\\n of inclusion and exclusion with the seriousness that it deserves. The dissertation proposes\\n that populist mobilization is a necessary corrective to the shortcomings of deliberative\\n democracy. Finally, the dissertation explores ways in which deliberation and mobilization can\\n be institutionalized in ways that are conducive to more democratization.

This field research with a qualitative approach in this research is outlined using qualitative descriptive methods. The research findings showed that the Indonesian Anti-Communist Front of Yogyakarta City has a strategy of resistance to communism by organizing rallies and even rallies always collaborating with other nationalist community organizations. FAKI Yogyakarta also always holds an annual event that commemorates Pancasila day by watching G30S/PKI films together to grow the nation's knowledge, especially the younger generation of strategy. The next is to oversee discussions that smell communist and views on politics and religion, The Discourse of the Indonesian Anti-Communist Front Yogyakarta city given the political movement of communism is In the power struggle my words about the Indonesian Communist Party is the goal of justifying various ways to achieve the desire for power (Politics), the goal of justifying all means. The discourse of the Indonesian Anti-Communist Front of Yogyakarta city views communist social viewpoints and beliefs consistent with its historical methods. Communists view religion as a result of the history of human development. Based on historical materialism, the beginning of religion was designed by man as an institution containing all aspects of goodness, beauty, justice, and the realm of Communists viewing religion as a human creation. Religion is an imaginary world. Communism, which has a very heinous problem with theology, causes distrust of God and even causes them to be anti-God, anti-Religion, and even aggressive towards religious groups. But part of the Indonesian Communist Party cadre is Islamic, so what the Indonesian Anti-Communist Front says does not represent a diverse reality about PKI and communism.",

The first part of the paper presents the criticisms that challenge every reasonable character of Kant's conception of enlightenment. After that, these critiques are confronted with the defenses of Kant's definition of enlightenment that points out, on the one hand, its self-reflectivity and, on the other, its everlasting actuality. Special attention is paid to the historical and textual reconstruction of the understanding of public as a condition of the possibilities for the effective engagement of the mind and the rational organization of society. It is concluded that the question of enlightenment remains open, to the extent that the danger of arbitrary use under a completely vague semantic rules threatening the very notion of enlightenment. Continuous reinterpretations of Kant's attempt to define it, however, are also testimonies of an unavoidable instance, with respect to which - by recognition of its relevance, its rearranging or rejection - different conceptions of enlightenment and its landmarks were tempted, articulated and established.",

      "abstract": "The terms postcolonialism and decoloniality are used for a wide variety of critical theories that have one premise in common: the conviction that the world as we know it has been shaped by European colonialism, that it continues to be shaped by colonialism's post- or neocolonial afterlife, and that this process is violent, oppressive, and should come to an end\u2014a constellation for which Quijano (2007) coined the term coloniality. In this article, I will refer to all these approaches collectively as postcolonial critique.1 The implications postcolonial critique has for political theory and its methodology have already been discussed by various authors (e.g., Kerner 2018, 2022, 2024; Dhawan 2014). In this article, I build on their works but pursue a question that is much narrower but at the same time goes somewhat further. I not only discuss what aspects of mainstream theories appear to be \u201ccritical\u201d from a postcolonial perspective, but I also use a specific example to explain what should be done with these theories once they have been subjected to postcolonial critique: Should we still read them, and if so, how? How should they be altered? And to what extent can they still be useful? As an example for this discussion, I choose Habermasian theory. I do so for two reasons. The first reason derives from the theory itself, namely, from the proximity between postcolonial critique and critical theory (Kerner 2018, 617\u2013623). This proximity raises hope for fruitful engagement. The second reason is more subjective and idiosyncratic. Being socialized in Habermasian theory and willing to take postcolonial critique seriously, I want to find out what I should do with the critical theory I inherited. I mention this reference to a subjective and idiosyncratic motivation to avoid a possible misleading impression: I do not want to suggest that the quest for a postcolonial rereading of Habermasian theory is among the prime concerns of postcolonial critique. It is not. Nevertheless, postcolonial theory can be read with this question in mind\u2014as I argue with fruitful results. The remainder of the article consists of four sections. I begin by sketching the two aspects that seem most critical about mainstream political theory from a postcolonial perspective: first, the entanglement between the discourse of emancipation and the discourse of inequality in the Western tradition, and second, the ethnocentric treatment of global heterogeneity (Section 2). I then go on to deliver a sketch of Habermasian theory and lay out which aspects of this theory could appear critical from a postcolonial perspective (Section 3). Next, I present four types of postcolonial critique. These are the minimally invasive approach of selective historicization (Section 4.1), Amy Allen's notion of decolonization as a return to metanormative contextualism (Section 4.2), Walter Mignolo's notion of decolonization as border thinking and decoupling (Section 4.3), and a conception of provincialization found in the works of Gayatri Spivak, Dipesh Chakrabarty, and Paul Gilroy (Section 4.4). Because the latter approach calls for a thorough rereading of Western texts, the article ends with such a discussion of Habermasian theory, naming six steps that should be taken to provincialize Frankfurt and make critical theory better suited to deal with postcolonial heterogeneity (Section 5). The relationship between postcolonial critique on the one side and the different universalist theories from the Western tradition on the other side is a complicated one. Both sides avowedly pursue a fundamental critique of domination and strive for the self-determination of all human beings. Hence, some postcolonial critics regularly make positive references to the \u201cuniversals enshrined in post-Enlightenment rationalism or humanism\u201d (Chakrabarty 2007, 70). Yet, the relationship gets complicated, mainly due to two factors. The first is the fact that the very same theoretical tradition that produced these universalisms has been entangled with colonial domination and its legitimation. Some of the very same normative theories that promote the universal self-determination of free and equal human beings are closely linked to anthropological theories of inequality that assert essential differences between human groups and thereby explicitly or implicitly contribute to the justification of unequal treatment and (colonial) domination. I will refer to the former as the discourse of emancipation and the latter as the discourse of inequality. One of the first steps the postcolonial critique of mainstream theory usually takes is to show that prominent theorists of the discourse of emancipation, such as John Locke, John Stuart Mill, or Immanuel Kant, also contributed to the discourse of inequality, proving that both discourses are entangled (Eze 1997a, 1997b; Mills 1999; McCarthy 2009, 25\u201327; Quijano 2007). Thus, the question arises: What consequences should this entanglement have for the way we read these historical works and their more recent successor theories? The second factor complicating the relationship between postcolonial critique and the universalist theories from the Western tradition is the ethnocentric and ignorant treatment of global heterogeneity within many of these theories.

The first way of with postcolonial is minimally invasive and consists of an to the discourse of emancipation from the discourse of inequality, the former and the The entanglement with the discourse of inequality is then as an of historical that not the of the discourse of of the discourse of inequality or the justification of colonial one in the of a from the discourse of emancipation are then as an to the of their theory. This can be and the which is This minimally invasive approach is usually not by postcolonial critics but in to postcolonial to of and one to such an approach to the Habermasian one that are some that seem by but the The approach of and theories is in are at or this approach can only be if the aspects are of inequality that are as one not know which to could one that of the theory these aspects This the in and human (Eze 1997b; McCarthy 2009, are that have more the of the and that the European a for other a of but are not as and is can be used to and the that such an will only In other and historicization is only a if the between the discourse of emancipation and the discourse of inequality is the latter a for the so that the former the then and be and the of the is not a This can also be by the in the works of and In the the on the one side and the relevant normative theories on the other side are found in different Thus, one can make a for the of the In the discussion of the and the of the of different can be found in the and have a for the theory of and the of as a process of from the theoretical the selective of a from the discourse of inequality with a that theory itself, the of and postcolonial only by of selective the to postcolonial be to a of the normative that their and a in the very same that at the very same time it Some postcolonial critics such an as an It is for this reason that that the former colonial can only if they an equal by of a by of the question of the entanglement between the discourses of emancipation and inequality is or the continues to have The second way of with postcolonial in theory can be found in Amy Allen's The of the of to most other postcolonial in this article, at as one of its And a in critical theory with Allen's critique is among the most It is the to lay out the normative of critical theory as it by and by and each of a the entanglement between the discourse of emancipation and the discourse of inequality is not Hence, it a critical theorists the of these entangled discourses by normative in a or that both and in fact all to normative are ethnocentric and colonial on the of of reason as and then this conception of reason as a for normative the that such an can only a way of thinking as on the other the historical of as the of universal which also the of make both the of (colonial) domination as and one could of this perspective, of both justification is and is entangled in colonial thinking at its normative all aspects seem normative to be of other and as is one of this and is not but essential to theory. Allen's is critique of universalist rationalism is a and not a that and the of a and that this has been time and this not that reason not or that it be an of domination. a to the question by the theories How can critical theory its critical can the question to it by to a of with that by critique or metanormative contextualism theory then have to take the normative in a their and in with a more As an to the of emancipation in to the a from their that is fundamental but the of they for and contributed to its Hence, critical theory can this as and in with these the should critique take the of as its reference and not some other such as that The latter can also be as fundamental of the same that are only a or that these and for their not be as an of critique and an of as emancipation This raises the that Allen's critique only to be in fact on that not for in to avoid the of One could argue that critical theory will by only with the of for emancipation and and that the will be out not in but in an with these a postcolonial with from the global if one the premise that critical theory by at emancipation and this not the are of emancipation and and are many different from the global to for emancipation or with some of these to one Hence, a critical the of relevant it to on these in a and to as if they do not The way of with the postcolonial is found in Walter Mignolo's conception of Mignolo's is the that the theories of the Western tradition are One could in to these and in this these theories are closely entangled with the this reference 2007, references the entanglement between the discourses of emancipation and of inequality that not to be but essential Kerner of a of and a of 2007, it is the universalist of the theories that the side of coloniality. this with an that one and one can the normative for the of all in all goes on to argue that as as this side of the colonial be on a political decolonization be by decolonization in to decolonization to take thinking the Western this as a process of two steps to as border thinking and thinking is a from As its border thinking should take that the of and as its These other and are to be taken and

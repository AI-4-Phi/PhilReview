      "abstract": "In modern states, law is often reduced to merely a tool of power. Many contemporary practices treat law as nothing more than a procedural requirement, disregarding its substantive values and the social conditions of society. This article discusses the validity of law within a political community from Habermas's perspective. According to him, the law must be discursive and stem from rational subjects capable of effective communication. The fundamental questions addressed are: how can law ideally be derived from norms within a political society? And how can law subsequently foster a democratic society? This article employs historical-factual methods, with primary sources drawn from the works of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Habermas used discourse ethics and the theory of communicative action. Data collection is conducted through textual analysis. The article concludes that the validity of law must originate from discursive norms present in society, even though there may be tensions between theory and practice in society.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of hermeneutic science is outlined by Habermas as a reflection within the ordinary language, addressed to the dialogic dimension of intersubjective recognition and connected to the juridical guarantee. The guarantee function fulfilled by the discursive agreement towards every real dialogue is obvious: it indicates the main reference point for the regulation and coordination of social action, tracing a line of demarcation between being and having to be, facts and norms. Speech, communicative agreement and legal guarantee are mutually qualified terms where the public discussion of institutional issues makes it possible to define the normative validity as non-assimilatory generality, placed beyond any populistic yearning, tracing a line of demarcation between law and power. The idea of deliberative democracy expresses the relationship and distinction between the universalism of rights and the factuality of the norm issuing, between the idea of good and the idea of right, in order to support democratic decision-making legitimacy. Combining the reasons of the markets with those of civil solidarity, through independent forms of regulation both from the obsolete state sovereignties and from the traditional international perspectives, represents a primary challenge of the Habermasian theory where the critical role of the rational public sphere appears fundamental.",

First, the formal pragmatic analysis of communicative rationality and practical rationality in post-metaphysical thought will be introduced, as well as post-conventional justification and the validity of moral norms oughtness. Then, the cognitive content of morality will be outlined through the elaboration of the principle of universalization (U) and the principle of discourse ethics (D). The co-originality will be discussed in the sense that the Principle of Democracy is derived from \u201cD.\u201d The complementarity relationship will be examined based on how Morality, in light of the Principle of Universalization (U), provides normative content in terms of universalizable reasons to Law, while Law addresses its cognitive, operational, and motivational deficits. Positive law and post-conventional morality are thus the main mechanisms of social integration in modernity, as they permeate the structural components of the lifeworld. Finally, the relationship between these mechanisms should be one of complementarity; otherwise, Law, which is known to be constituted in the tension between facticity and validity and, therefore, always mutable, risks losing its capacity for social integration and expectation stabilization.",

Despite democratic consolidation through the Candlelight Revolution (2016\u20132017), Korea's political landscape remains marked by hierarchical cultural norms rooted in Confucian traditions. Drawing on J\u00fcrgen Habermas's discourse ethics and Stephen Angle's Progressive Confucianism, this study examines how meritocratic discourses shape civic attitudes and institutional practices in ways that both support and undermine democratic legitimacy. The article demonstrates that contemporary Confucian meritocracy often produces systematically distorted communication, excluding citizens from participatory deliberation. The analysis interrogates Confucian values\u2019 role in recent democratic crises, including President Yoon Suk-yeol's 2024 martial law declaration, showing how meritocratic rhetoric justified anti-democratic measures. However, the study reveals potential for Confucian ethical resources to reinforce democratic values when critically reconstructed through communicative action. The Korean case illustrates the struggle to reconcile inherited cultural traditions with democratic ideals, highlighting the importance of institutional frameworks balancing moral excellence with political equality. This contributes to debates on post-Confucian democracy by emphasizing that legitimacy hinges not on rejecting tradition but on subjecting all political claims to rational scrutiny through inclusive democratic discourse.",

      "abstract": "The foundations of deliberative democracy rest on ideals of communicative rationality, as articulated by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a key representative of the Frankfurt School\u2019s second generation. Emerging from critical theory\u2019s broader critique of instrumental rationality, deliberative democracy emphasizes public discourse and consensus as essential mechanisms for legitimate governance. This model assumes that through discourse ethics, diverse societal interests can converge toward norms, transcending\npartial biases. However, in times of uncertainty \u2014 particularly during war or social upheaval \u2014 these assumptions face significant challenges. The historical context of the Frankfurt School\u2019s development underscores this point. Established amidst the European crises of the early 20th century, critical theorists like Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer grappled with the failures of rationality that led to totalitarianism. The critique of deliberative democracy in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war highlights\nthe need to reassess the theory\u2019s practical and ethical foundations. While deliberative democracy aspires to foster inclusivity and legitimacy through rational discourse, its application during periods of profound uncertainty exposes critical vulnerabilities. These include the challenges of relativism, asymmetrical power dynamics, and the ethical risks of procedural neutrality. The aim of this study is to probe the practical applicability\nand evaluate the core epistemological and ethical assumptions of deliberative democracy, particularly its Habermasian formulations, when confronted with conditions of uncertainty. It critically examines the theoretical underpinnings of deliberative democracy, its limitations, and the ethical dilemmas posed by its procedural inclusivity. Methodological approach taken in this article builds upon case study to illustrate the limitations of deliberative democracy, and draws on critical theory \u2014 especially\nthose of Theodor Adorno and J\u00fcrgen Habermas \u2014 to evaluate its epistemological and ethical assumptions.",

      "abstract": "The Aristotelian distinction between technical and moral reason, production and interaction permeates Habermas\u2019s thought. But in moral theory, Habermas\u2019s main emphasis is on the decontextualized justification of moral norms, while Aristotle\u2019s focus is on contextualized judgment. The paper argues that Aristotle\u2019s theory of practical wisdom could be instructive for discourse ethics. Habermas has not been open to this possibility because he has appropriated the neo-Aristotelian interpretation of Aristotle, in which practical wisdom is subordinated to traditional norms, an interpretation that neglects the role of reason in moral deliberation. Moreover, the contemporary ethos is impregnated with universal moral demands which, it is supposed, should guide our moral judgments. It is further argued that there are elements in Habermas\u2019s theory of moral and social development which can serve a role comparable to that of teleology in Aristotle. The paper maintains that a possible way to strengthen discourse ethics by incorporating practical wisdom is to tease out the implications of the fact that both Habermas and Aristotle build their views on the human capacity for speech and reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Human rights constitute a form of defense of human life, in its individual and collective configuration, with dignity. This normative political ideal acquired theoretical density throughout history when it was conceived as the desire for freedom and equality in law and in fact for individuals and communities that fought to guarantee their representation in political society. Human rights are the expression that each individual and the social group must be respected in the potential development of their capacities. The perspective of the universality of human rights provides the analysis of its foundation under multiple theoretical orientations and movements in defense of its normative meaning. In Amartya Sen's theory of capability approach, human rights are questioned by their competence in guaranteeing the material and structural conditions for a life of dignity. J\u00fcrgen Habermas' discourse theory clarifies the intrinsic relationship between human rights and democracy in their connection with private and public autonomy. Robert Alexy's discursive constitutionalism amplifies the ideal of human rights by deepening the reflection on its characteristics and its politicization in the configuration of fundamental rights. Finally, human rights are the normative reference for the foundation of a democratic and fair society, and we must observe its semantic structure from the multiple theoretical perspectives in dialogue.",

      "abstract": "A framework derived from Jurgen Habermas\u2019 Between Facts and Norms is utilized to address the question of how claims for minority rights that emerge from ethical-political discourses may receive public recognition. The major difficulty in this regard turns upon discrepancies between the interpretations of minority cultural needs by the members of a given community and interpretations of the same needs on the part of those outside of the community in question. The discussion includes a critical analysis of proposed resolutions of this problem put forward in Between Facts and Norms, in other works of Habermas, and in the various publications of James Bohman, Jorge Valadez, Michael Rabinder James, and Monique Deveaux. I argue that the best way to assess the cogency of discourses across cultural \u201cbarriers\u201d does not involve minimizing requirements for their deliberativeness, as the latter four of these authors tend to accept, but rather strictly differentiating between the procedure and substance of the deliberation.",

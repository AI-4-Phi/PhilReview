      "abstract": "This article aims to discuss certain repercussions seen in the intellectual and political trajectory of An\u00edbal Quijano (1930-2018). Specifically, it seeks to reconstruct the context of the \u201cparadigm crisis\u201d of the social sciences and the decline of the Marxist left, which were sharply manifested in the 1980s, examining how the Peruvian sociologist found solutions to the historical crossroads that heralded a generation of social scientists engaged in Latin America. It begins with the hypothesis that the crystallization of a cycle of political defeats made possible a new theoretical redirect for Quijano to understand Latin American history in its political and epistemic framework. It then analyzes the author\u2019s convergence with and distancing from the Marxist tradition from the perspective of the \u201ccoloniality of power.\u201d O objetivo deste artigo \u00e9 discutir alguns desdobramentos presentes na trajet\u00f3ria intelectual e pol\u00edtica de An\u00edbal Quijano (1930-2018). Procura-se reconstruir especialmente o contexto de \u201ccrise dos paradigmas\u201d das ci\u00eancias sociais e de decl\u00ednio da esquerda marxista, que se manifestaram de modo acentuado na d\u00e9cada de 1980, examinando como o soci\u00f3logo peruano encontrou solu\u00e7\u00f5es para a encruzilhada hist\u00f3rica que se anunciava a uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o de cientistas sociais engajados na Am\u00e9rica Latina. Parte-se da hip\u00f3tese de que a cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um ciclo de derrotas pol\u00edticas possibilitou um novo redirecionamento te\u00f3rico para Quijano entender a hist\u00f3ria latino-americana em sua moldura pol\u00edtica e epist\u00eamica. Por fim, analisa-se o movimento de aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o e distanciamento que o autor faz com a tradi\u00e7\u00e3o marxista a partir da perspectiva adotada da \u201ccolonialidade do poder\u201d.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An\u00edbal Quijano has been one of the most astute and purposeful Latin American social theorists of the second half of the 20th century. His pioneering essays on the \u2018Coloniality of Power\u2019 not only inspired the project of Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality, but have also influenced countless intellectuals and activists who were not necessarily involved in the so-called \u2018Decolonial Turn.\u2019 While Quijano has not left behind a text in which all of the characteristics of his theory on \u2018Coloniality\u2019 are systematised, it can be argued that the lengthy essay \u2018Coloniality of Power, Eurocentrism and Latin America,\u2019 published for the first time twenty years ago, was intended to provide such an overview of his thought. The purpose of this forum is to critically debate the legacy of the Peruvian sociologist during a period which Quijano himself later described as the \u2018Root Crisis of the Coloniality of Global Power.\u2019 In the first section, Jos\u00e9 Gandarilla presents the Latin American antecedents and precursors of the use of the term \u2018Coloniality.\u2019 Next, Hayde\u00e9 Garc\u00eda reflects on the interdisciplinary perspective in An\u00edbal Quijano, the weight of totality, and its historical articulations. Finally, Daniele Benzi opens up and addresses some queries regarding \u2018colonial/modern and Eurocentered capitalism,\u2019 from the perspective of macro-historical sociology.",

It demonstrates how the triple form of domination \u2013 ontological, epistemological and political-military-administrative \u2013 to which Libya was subjected during Italian colonisation, has survived its end and persists to this day in the relations between Libya and the Western world. From an ontological perspective, the Italians developed a racist representation of the Libyans, which was both the cause and the consequence of a conscious disregard of its specificities. Today, domination endures in the label attributed to Libya as a \u2018failed state\u2019, along with a general disinterest in the complexity of its history and society. From an epistemological perspective, the production of knowledge about Libya was dominated by Western scholars. This led to a Western perspective in which the agency of the Libyans was often neglected and to the spread of analytical and conceptual frameworks that serve the imperialistic claims of Western powers. Some of these colonialist analytical frameworks still exist in academia today. From a political-military-administrative perspective, the tendency of the Italians to exacerbate internal divisions while simultaneously imposing an inefficient model of a unified state remains relevant. This article makes two contributions: it is a case study and a theoretical one.",

Starting from decolonial studies, the ethical question about those otherness denied in our history made possible an \u201cother\u201d path of subjective intellection: not only in relation to the founding and historical processes with which modernity unilaterally promoted its own walk, but, fundamentally, in relation to the threshold of possibilities of transformation of our present and in our future. In this way, the changes of logic that allow granting new meanings take precisely the set of those alterities not taken into account by modernity and constituted from that \u201cnon-identity\u201d as \u201cthe decolonial engine of History\u201d. Trying to review the known and rename the everyday, through theoretical-political categories that challenge our colonial history, will contribute to understanding the current insistence of the coloniality of power; and, at the same time, contextualize the emergence of certain political, social, educational and cultural practices that erupt unprecedentedly, giving rise to new processes of \u201cdeconstruction\u201d of the Nation-States in order to counteract it.",

It is not new for Indigenous women to mobilize together with their peoples to defend the land-territory-life, but in recent years their participation has become more visible to the extent that the threat to the territories also involves fundamental elements for the reproduction of life that previously had not been of interest to capital. In this context my interest is focused on the ways in which the women of the territories create and resist from other ontologies in defense of life. Thinking the reality of our countries from the coloniality of power and the coloniality of gender implies, among other things, taking as a baseline the existence of structures of domination, exploitation, and extermination that have been reproduced over the last five centuries in Abya Yala, and that have led to the imposition of a world classification that denies the existence of other worlds that inhabit these territories, and that have been persecuted, massacred, made invisible, but that exist and re-exist (Alb\u00e1n 2013).",

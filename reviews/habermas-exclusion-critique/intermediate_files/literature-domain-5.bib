====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers philosophical critiques of Habermasian communicative
action theory and deliberative democracy from the standpoint of critical
race theory, Black existentialism, and postcolonial thought. Three
overlapping strands structure the field. First, critics argue that
Habermas's proceduralist model of the public sphere assumes conditions
of communicative parity (equal access, mutual recognition, shared
lifeworld) that are systematically denied to racialized groups under
white supremacy. Fraser's foundational critique showed that actually
existing liberal democracies harbor "subaltern counterpublics" excluded
from the bourgeois public sphere, while Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer
extend this to show that Habermas's original account of the public
sphere suppressed the history of racial exclusion from deliberative
spaces. Second, philosophers drawing on Charles Mills's concept of the
"racial contract" contend that the social-contract tradition on which
Habermas relies is structurally premised on the epistemic and political
exclusion of non-white persons, so that Habermasian discourse ethics
inherits this white-supremacist scaffolding without acknowledging it.
Third, critics identify a foundational blindspot within the Frankfurt
School itself: Horkheimer, Adorno, and Habermas left race and empire
almost entirely untheorized, producing a tradition of "critical theory"
that ironically reproduced Eurocentrism and a progress-teleology
contaminated by its colonial context. Amy Allen and Thomas McCarthy have
been the most prominent internal critics pressing this charge, while
Gurminder Bhambra and postcolonial scholars push from outside the tradition.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain addresses the central concern of the broader project by
demonstrating that Habermas's frameworks for communicative rationality
and the public sphere are not merely gender-blind or class-blind but
also race-blind in ways that are structurally significant rather than
contingent. It provides the race-specific version of the general thesis
that exclusions from Habermasian communicative parity are not accidental
features that can be corrected by procedural reforms but are embedded in
the theory's foundational assumptions about rationality, progress, and
the subject of discourse.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The specific connection between Fanon's account of the colonial
disruption of intersubjective recognition and Habermas's theory of
communicative action is underdeveloped in the literature: few papers
explicitly bridge Fanon's phenomenology and Habermas's discourse
ethics. The question of whether there is a genuinely anti-racist
reconstruction of deliberative democracy (as opposed to critique of
it) remains contested, with Mendonca/Asenbaum and Drake representing
recent efforts. Gordon and Outlaw appear in S2 but their major works
did not receive DOI verification from CrossRef (Books not indexed);
they are included based on S2 metadata.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The debate has two main poles: (1) internal critics who seek to
reconstruct critical theory by decolonizing its normative foundations
(Allen, McCarthy) versus (2) external critics who argue the
contamination runs so deep that Habermasian frameworks must be
replaced by radically different starting points (Mills, Gordon, Fanon
interpreters). Synthesis should treat these as substantively different
positions, not merely different emphases.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Internal decolonizing critique: 3 papers (Allen 2012, Allen 2016, McCarthy 2009)
- External racial contract critique: 3 papers (Mills via Issar 2024, Gordon 1995, Drake 2023)
- Public sphere / counterpublic critique: 3 papers (Fraser 1990, Charles & Fuentes-Rohwer 2015, Biswas 2022)
- Frankfurt School blindspot critique: 2 papers (Bhambra 2021, Allen 2007)
- Decolonizing reconstruction: 2 papers (Mendonca & Asenbaum 2025, Banerjee 2021)
- Phenomenological/existential critique: 2 papers (Fanon 1952, Gordon 1995)

@book{fanon1952black,
  author = {Fanon, Frantz},
  title = {Black Skin, White Masks},
  year = {1952},
  publisher = {Grove Press},
  abstract = {A major influence on civil rights, anti-colonial, and black consciousness movements around the world, Black Skin, White Masks is the unsurpassed study of the black psyche in a white world. Hailed for its scientific analysis and poetic grace when it was first published in 1952, the book remains a vital force today. Fanon demonstrates how the problem of race and color connects with a whole range of words and images, and offers a phenomenological account of the lived experience of racialization under colonialism.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fanon offers a phenomenological account of how the colonial gaze constitutes the Black subject as an object, disrupting the intersubjective conditions of mutual recognition that would be required for genuine communicative equality. The racialized body is not a free participant in discourse but is overdetermined from the outside, foreclosing the conditions Habermas requires for undistorted communication.

  RELEVANCE: Fanon's analysis of how colonial racism structures subjectivity provides the phenomenological basis for critiques of Habermasian communicative rationality that stress the asymmetric constitution of speaking subjects under racial domination. Where Habermas assumes subjects capable of equal participation in discourse, Fanon shows that racialization produces subjects structurally barred from such participation.

  POSITION: Foundational Black existentialist text, used by Gordon and others to argue that communicative rationality presupposes conditions of recognition that racial domination destroys.

  title = {Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism},
  year = {1995},
  publisher = {Bloomsbury Publishing},
  doi = {10.5040/9798765164815},
  abstract = {Lewis Gordon presents a detailed existential phenomenological investigation of antiblack racism as a form of Sartrean bad faith. Bad faith, the attitude in which human beings attempt to evade freedom and responsibility, is treated as a constant possibility of human existence. Antiblack racism, the attitude and practice that involve the construction of black people as fundamentally inferior and subhuman, is examined as an effort to evade the responsibilities of a human and humane world. Gordon argues that the concept of bad faith militates against any human science that is built upon a theory of human nature and as such offers an analysis of antiblack racism that stands as a challenge to ordinary assumptions of what it means to be human.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gordon argues that antiblack racism is a form of bad faith in the Sartrean sense: those who practice it deny the humanity and freedom of Black people in order to evade their own responsibilities as moral agents. This analysis situates antiblack racism not as mere prejudice but as a structural feature of a social world that refuses to extend the conditions of equal standing to Black persons.

  RELEVANCE: Gordon's account implies that any theory of communicative rationality or discourse ethics that ignores the bad-faith constitution of antiblack racism will fail to register the structural denial of communicative competence to Black subjects. The Habermasian presupposition that participants are free to give and ask for reasons is shown to rest on conditions that antiblack racism systematically undermines.

  POSITION: Black existentialist tradition, draws on Fanon and Sartre to mount a critique of liberal theories of equal moral standing that assume conditions of recognition antiblack racism destroys.

  journal = {Social Text},
  year = {1990},
  number = {25/26},
  pages = {56--80},
  doi = {10.2307/466240},
  abstract = {Fraser critiques Habermas's idealized account of the bourgeois public sphere on four counts: (1) it excluded women and other groups, treating this exclusion as merely accidental rather than constitutive; (2) a single comprehensive public sphere disadvantages minorities who would benefit from competing subaltern counterpublics; (3) the model illegitimately privatizes issues of common concern; (4) it requires bracketing social inequality in ways that actually amplify rather than reduce its effects. Fraser introduces the concept of "subaltern counterpublics" -- parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated groups reformulate their identities and articulate oppositional needs.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fraser argues that Habermas's account of the public sphere brackets social inequality as though it were merely a contingent obstacle to ideal discourse, when in fact the bourgeois public sphere's exclusions of women, working-class people, and racialized groups were structurally constitutive of it. She proposes "subaltern counterpublics" as the appropriate response to conditions of social inequality where a single unified public sphere marginalizes dominated groups.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational feminist and democratic-theoretic critique of Habermasian public sphere theory, and it provides the conceptual framework (subaltern counterpublics, bracketing inequality) that subsequent race-focused critiques build on. Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer directly extend Fraser's framework to racial exclusion.

  POSITION: Feminist critical theory, broadly sympathetic to Habermas's project but arguing that his idealized reconstruction suppresses actually existing exclusions that are structurally significant.

@article{allen2007systematically,

  journal = {Philosophy \& Social Criticism},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {33},
  number = {5},
  pages = {641--650},
  doi = {10.1177/0191453707078926},
  abstract = {Allen examines Habermas's account of systematically distorted communication and pathological identity formation, arguing that Habermas's framework pathologizes particularistic identities -- those rooted in cultural, racial, or gender specificity -- as failures of rational self-understanding. She contends that this move reflects a deeper Eurocentric bias in the theory of communicative rationality: identities shaped by histories of colonial subjugation or racial subordination are treated as deficient rather than as legitimate responses to structural injustice.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen argues that Habermas's conception of communicative rationality and ego-identity systematically pathologizes the bounded, particularistic identities formed under conditions of racial or colonial subjugation, treating them as failures of individuation rather than as legitimate responses to structural injustice. This reflects a deeper Eurocentric bias in the normative framework.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the question of whether Habermasian theory can accommodate racialized or colonially-formed subjectivities, and concludes that it structurally cannot without significant revision. It connects the Frankfurt School's abstract conception of the autonomous subject to the blindspot on race and colonialism.

  POSITION: Internal critique from within the Frankfurt School tradition; precursor to Allen's more extended decolonial critique in The End of Progress.

  year = {2012},
  volume = {19},
  number = {3},
  pages = {353--368},
  doi = {10.1111/cons.12005},
  abstract = {Allen examines the tension between reason and power in Habermas's political theory, focusing on his central claim that communicative rationality operates through the "unforced force of the better argument." She argues that Habermas underestimates the ways in which power relations pervade communicative contexts, shaping who counts as a competent speaker, whose arguments are heard as "better," and which communicative norms structure deliberation. The paper argues that this leads to a systematic idealization that depoliticizes the very conditions under which reason operates.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen argues that Habermas's account of communicative reason as operating through the "unforced force of the better argument" systematically underestimates how power relations structure the conditions of deliberation -- determining who counts as a competent speaker, whose contributions are taken seriously, and which norms of reasonableness prevail. The force of the "better argument" is not force-free but operates within power-laden contexts.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most targeted philosophical analysis of how power asymmetries, including racial hierarchies, are smuggled back into Habermasian deliberation through the supposedly neutral standard of the better argument. It directly answers the key question of what structural features of Habermasian theory render it blind to racial domination.

  POSITION: Internal Frankfurt School critique seeking to reconstruct rather than abandon communicative rationality, but insisting that the normative framework must be power-sensitive.

@book{allen2016end,
  author = {Allen, Amy},
  title = {The End of Progress: Decolonizing the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory},
  year = {2016},
  publisher = {Columbia University Press},
  doi = {10.7312/alle17324},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen argues that the Frankfurt School tradition -- from Horkheimer and Adorno through Habermas -- relies on a normative conception of modernity as progressive that is contaminated by its Eurocentric and colonial origins. The idea of "progress" used to ground critical theory's normative claims was forged in the context of European imperialism and racial hierarchy, which the tradition never adequately confronted. Allen proposes a postfoundationalist alternative that abandons progress-teleology while preserving the emancipatory aims of critical theory.

  RELEVANCE: This book is the most developed systematic argument that the Frankfurt School's failure to engage with race and colonialism is not a peripheral oversight but a structural feature of its normative foundations. It directly answers the key question about the Frankfurt School's historical silence on race and its implications for Habermas.

  POSITION: Internal decolonial critique of the Frankfurt School tradition; seeks reconstruction rather than rejection, but argues the reconstruction requires abandoning the Eurocentric progress narrative that Habermas inherits.

@book{mccarthy2009race,
  author = {McCarthy, Thomas},

  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511814044},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarthy examines how the dominant 19th and early 20th century European idea of human development -- the idea that history progresses through stages from primitive to civilized -- provided the intellectual justification for racial hierarchy and imperial domination. He argues that this developmentalist framework is deeply embedded in the liberal and critical-theoretical traditions, including Habermas, and that confronting it requires a reckoning with how race and empire shaped the very categories of modern political philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: McCarthy's book provides the historical and philosophical basis for understanding the Frankfurt School's blindspot on race: it is not mere neglect but is connected to a shared developmentalist framework that rationalized racial hierarchy. This directly bears on why Habermasian theory has difficulty accommodating race as a structural rather than contingent problem.

  POSITION: Internal critique from within the Frankfurt School tradition (McCarthy was a close collaborator of Habermas), pressing the tradition to confront its own entanglement with European developmentalism and its racial implications.

@article{bhambra2021decolonizing,

  title = {Decolonizing Critical Theory?},
  journal = {Critical Times},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {4},
  number = {1},
  pages = {73--89},
  doi = {10.1215/26410478-8855227},
  abstract = {Theorists working within the Frankfurt School tradition of critical theory have not been immune to calls to "decolonize" that have been circulating in and beyond the academic world. This article asks what it means to seek to decolonize a tradition of thought that has never explicitly acknowledged colonial histories. What is needed, instead, this article suggests, is consideration of the very implications of the "colonial modern" -- that is, an acknowledgement of the colonial constitution of modernity -- for Frankfurt School critical theory's idea of historical progress. The issue is more extensive than simply acknowledging the substantive neglect of colonialism within the tradition; rather, this article suggests that its categories of critique and their associated normative claims are also necessarily implicated by this neglect and require transformation. Acknowledgment of colonial histories requires material reparations for the substantive inequalities bequeathed as legacies of the past, but these reparations also require a transformation of understandings and a recognition of "epistemological justice."},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bhambra argues that decolonizing critical theory requires more than adding colonial histories to an existing framework: the categories of critique themselves -- including the Frankfurt School's conception of modernity, rationality, and progress -- are constituted by colonial exclusions and cannot simply absorb postcolonial insights without fundamental transformation. "Epistemological justice" requires rethinking the very standpoint from which critique is launched.

  RELEVANCE: Bhambra's critique of the Frankfurt School from a postcolonial standpoint provides the external counterpart to Allen's internal critique, arguing that the colonial blindspot cannot be corrected by internal reconstruction but requires a more radical epistemological rethinking. This bears directly on whether any Habermasian framework can be rehabilitated for race-conscious political philosophy.

  POSITION: Postcolonial external critique of the Frankfurt School; more skeptical than Allen about the possibility of internal reconstruction.

  doi = {10.36643/mjrl.21.1.habermas},
  abstract = {In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Habermas documented the historical emergence of the bourgeois public sphere as a space where individuals gathered to discuss matters of shared concern through the power of the better argument. This article argues that Habermas's account of the public sphere suppressed the history of racial exclusion from deliberative spaces. Drawing on Fraser's concept of subaltern counterpublics, the authors argue that Black Americans created a racial counterpublic as a response to their systematic exclusion from the dominant public sphere, and that this history reveals structural features of the bourgeois public sphere that Habermas's theory cannot accommodate.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors argue that Habermas's idealized account of the bourgeois public sphere systematically suppressed the racial exclusions that structured it, and that Black Americans developed a racial counterpublic precisely because they were barred from the dominant deliberative space. This counterpublic was not a supplement to the main public sphere but an alternative constructed under conditions of racial domination.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most direct legal-philosophical engagement with Habermas's public sphere theory from the standpoint of race, showing that the historical account Habermas offers is incomplete in ways that have normative consequences. It connects the race critique to Habermas's foundational text.

  POSITION: Critical race approach to the Habermasian public sphere, extends Fraser's feminist critique to racial exclusion and develops the counterpublic framework for race-conscious democratic theory.

  number = {1},
  pages = {92--112},
  doi = {10.1017/S0008423922000919},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Drake argues that deliberative democracy theory, and especially its Habermasian variants, is unable to adequately address systemic racism because it conceptualizes racism as a problem of distorted communication or individual prejudice rather than as a structural feature of the social system. She argues that deliberative models must be fundamentally reconceived to address how systemic racism pervades the conditions under which deliberation takes place.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a direct, contemporary philosophical analysis of the specific inadequacies of Habermasian deliberative theory in the face of systemic racism, making it one of the most targeted entries in this domain. It addresses the key question of what structural features render the theory blind to racial domination.

  POSITION: Critical race reconstruction of deliberative democracy; argues for structural rather than procedural reforms to deliberative theory.

  title = {Inclusion and Democracy},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0198297556.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Young argues that deliberative democracy as typically conceived -- particularly in its Habermasian form -- privileges certain modes of communication (reasoned argument, dispassionate discourse) that are culturally associated with educated, white, male professionals, while devaluing the communicative styles of marginalized groups. She proposes expanding the concept of deliberation to include greeting, rhetoric, and storytelling as legitimate democratic communication.

  RELEVANCE: Young's critique of the cultural bias in deliberative norms is directly relevant to the race critique of Habermas: the "norms of reasonableness" that Habermasian discourse ethics takes as universal are shown to be culturally specific in ways that systematically disadvantage racialized groups. Her account of communicative inequality supplements the structural critique with an analysis of epistemic injustice in deliberative settings.

  POSITION: Feminist and multicultural democratic theory, sympathetic to deliberative democracy but arguing for a more inclusive account of legitimate political communication that does not privilege rationalist discourse styles.

  number = {2},
  pages = {203--222},
  doi = {10.1177/0191453707074139},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Owen argues that a critical theory of whiteness is necessary but not sufficient for an adequate account of racial oppression. Drawing on Habermas and Mills, he develops an account of whiteness as a social structure -- not merely individual prejudice -- that operates through specific mechanisms of social reproduction. He argues that Habermas's theory of communicative action provides resources for understanding how whiteness operates systemically but requires supplementation with Mills's racial contract to explain the structural character of white privilege.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is one of the few systematic attempts to put Habermas's critical theory into dialogue with Mills's racial contract theory, and it directly addresses what a critical theory of whiteness informed by Habermasian resources would look like. It is particularly relevant to the question of whether Habermasian frameworks can be reconstructed for race-conscious purposes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Banerjee argues that deliberative democracy -- as theorized in the Habermasian tradition -- is itself a colonial construct that imposes Western epistemic norms on subordinated communities, silencing indigenous and subaltern voices in the name of inclusive deliberation. He proposes alternatives drawing on postcolonial and indigenous perspectives that challenge the universalist pretensions of deliberative theory.

  RELEVANCE: Banerjee provides a postcolonial angle on the Habermasian blindspot, arguing that the very norms of deliberation -- what counts as a good argument, who counts as a competent deliberator -- are colonial constructs. This extends the race critique to a wider colonial frame and connects it to questions about epistemic justice in deliberative settings.

This article argues that if deliberative democracy is to unfold its full democratic potential, it needs to face its colonial legacies and position a decolonizing ethos at its center. The article proposes a framework consisting of six moves toward decolonizing deliberative democracy -- three deconstructive and three reconstructive: 1. acknowledging modernity's violence; 2. recognizing epistemic injustices within the knowledge production of deliberative democracy; 3. criticizing the colonial drive of deliberative institutions; 4. theorizing from the bottom up by and with Indigenous and marginalized groups; 5. engaging in an open dialogue with the Global South scholarship; 6. focusing on emancipation.},

They argue that deliberative democracy's ideals of inclusion, equality, and freedom are undermined by the colonial conditions of their production and require a decolonizing ethos to fulfill their promise.

  RELEVANCE: This 2025 paper represents the most recent systematic attempt to reconstruct deliberative democracy -- including its Habermasian variants -- in a way that confronts colonial legacies.

The article contends that the emergence of communicative rationality in the public sphere is unlikely to be facilitated by a singular and unitary modern public whose participants have commensurable languages and worlds. This argument is elaborated through an analysis of a public debate that occurred in 1888 between the headman of the Modh Baniya caste council and Gandhi, even though the discussion involved two people with an intersubjectively shared lifeworld who were engaged in deliberation as equals, the dialogue broke down, deepening divides.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Biswas argues that Habermas's presupposition of an intersubjectively shared lifeworld as the condition for communicative rationality fails under colonial conditions, where participants may nominally share a discursive space but inhabit incommensurable social worlds shaped by relations of domination. A historical case study from colonial India shows that even formally equal deliberation breaks down when colonial hierarchies pervade the lifeworld.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a historically grounded demonstration of how Habermasian communicative rationality breaks down under colonial conditions, extending the theoretical critique with an empirical case that shows the concept of the shared lifeworld cannot be assumed in contexts of racial and colonial hierarchies.

  doi = {10.1177/00905917241292638},
  abstract = {This essay argues that Charles Mills's normative vision for racial justice -- a reformed, race-attentive liberalism -- is fundamentally self-undermining because it embraces the liberal property form. Specifically, Issar shows how Mills's insistence on the practical utility of the property form for racial justice ignores both W.E.B. Du Bois's signal warning about the reactionary power of propertied interests and how the hegemony of Lockean liberalism is a key mediator of racial/colonial domination in the United States. The essay first shows how Mills's anti-racist, social democratic liberalism relies on and legitimizes a property rights framework. Drawing on Du Bois, Issar argues that Mills's reformed liberalism, by preserving the property form, places racial justice on an inherently unstable foundation while also excluding struggles for Indigenous sovereignty.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Issar argues that Mills's racial contract theory, despite its powerful critique of liberal social contract tradition, retains a commitment to the liberal property form that undermines its emancipatory goals. Drawing on Du Bois, Issar contends that a genuinely anti-racist politics requires challenging liberal property relations, not merely making them race-conscious.

  RELEVANCE: This recent engagement with Mills's racial contract theory clarifies the internal tensions in the most influential philosophical alternative to Habermasian liberal theory. It is relevant to the project by showing that the external critique of Habermas from a racial-contract standpoint faces its own structural tensions.

  POSITION: Critical extension and internal critique of Mills's racial contract framework, drawing on Du Bois's political economy; occupies a position to the left of Mills's "black radical liberalism."

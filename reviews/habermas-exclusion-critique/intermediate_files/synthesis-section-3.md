## Section 2: Lines of Exclusion — Feminist, Race, and Multi-Axis Critiques in Comparative Perspective

Section 1 established that exclusion from Habermasian communicative parity operates at three reinforcing levels: the historical-empirical, the procedural-normative, and the conceptual-foundational. This section surveys the major traditions of exclusion critique — feminist, race-critical, and multi-axis — as distinct but structurally convergent bodies of argument. What emerges is convergence on a shared diagnosis — that exclusions are constitutive of the framework rather than incidental — combined with persistent disagreement about whether that diagnosis demands immanent repair or structural replacement.

### Subsection 2.1: The Feminist Critique and the Counter-Public Model

The feminist critique is the most elaborated tradition of exclusion critique and has supplied the conceptual vocabulary that subsequent traditions continue to deploy. Fraser's "Rethinking the Public Sphere" (Fraser 1990) provided the pivotal synthesis: bracketing social inequalities amplifies them rather than neutralizing them; a single unified public consolidates hegemony under the guise of universality; designating certain matters private is itself a prior political settlement favoring the dominant; and non-bourgeois counter-publics are rendered invisible by the idealized account. The positive contribution — "subaltern counterpublics" as arenas where dominated groups reformulate identities and contest dominant interpretations — proposed that democratic contestation requires a plurality of competing publics rather than access to a unified one.

Two main feminist responses to Habermas emerged. Benhabib's *Situating the Self* (Benhabib 1992) proposed "interactive universalism" as an immanent reconstruction: discourse ethics can be revised to preserve the standpoint of the "concrete other" alongside the abstract "generalized other" that Habermas's universalization procedure presupposes, without abandoning the communicative framework. Young's *Inclusion and Democracy* (Young 2000) represents a more structurally critical position: the privileging of rational, dispassionate argument is not a correctable bias but reflects a deeper encoding of the dominant group's communicative style as the universal standard. "Communicative democracy" — which legitimizes greeting, rhetoric, and narrative alongside formal argument — contests the impartiality norm rather than supplementing it. The internal feminist debate between these positions — whether the framework is reformable (Benhabib) or whether its rational-argumentative privileging reflects a structural masculinism revision cannot dissolve (Young, McNay 2003) — recurs in each subsequent critique tradition. Fiig (2011) demonstrates empirically how formal inclusion coexists with substantive exclusion in opinion-forming publics; Kavada (2024) reconstructs the public sphere through feminist care ethics, placing vulnerability and embodied communication at the center; Aubert (2020) argues that Habermas's own resources in *Between Facts and Norms* contain responses to inclusion critiques his critics underestimate.

Fraser's counter-publics concept serves as the central bridge to other exclusion traditions. Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer (2015) extend it to show that Black Americans developed a racial counterpublic as a response to racial domination constitutive of the bourgeois sphere. Warner (2002) develops queer counterpublics against Habermas's heteronormative public/private distinction. And, as Section 3 argues, Dussel's community of victims functions structurally as a counterpublic formed under conditions of colonial exteriority so extreme that the very concept of subaltern challenge can barely hold.

### Subsection 2.2: Critical Race Critiques — The Racial Contract and Communicative Parity

The race critique shares the feminist diagnosis of procedural exclusion but adds a dimension feminist critiques historically underemphasized: that racial and colonial domination structures who counts as a fully competent deliberative subject, not merely who is formally admitted. This shift from the procedural to the ontological gives the race tradition its distinctive depth.

Fanon's *Black Skin, White Masks* (Fanon 1952) provides the phenomenological foundation: the colonial gaze constitutes the Black subject as an object overdetermined from without, disrupting the intersubjective conditions of mutual recognition that communicative action requires. The racialized subject's exclusion is not an external obstacle to free participation; it is a structural foreclosure of the conditions under which one can present oneself as a speaking subject at all. Gordon's *Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism* (Gordon 1995) extends this: antiblack racism systematically refuses to extend the conditions of equal standing to Black persons, meaning the Habermasian presupposition that participants are free to give and ask for reasons rests on social conditions racial domination structurally undermines.

Allen targets two specific mechanisms. First, Habermas's framework pathologizes particularistic identities formed under conditions of racial or colonial subjugation, treating them as failures of individuation rather than as legitimate responses to structural injustice (Allen 2007). Second, the "unforced force of the better argument" is not force-free: it operates within communicative contexts that power relations structure, determining who counts as a competent speaker and whose contributions register as contributions (Allen 2012). Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer (2015) show this blindspot is already operative in *The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere*, which suppresses the racial exclusions constitutive of the bourgeois sphere. Drake (2023) extends the critique: Habermasian deliberative theory conceptualizes racism as distorted communication or individual prejudice rather than as a structural feature pervading the conditions of deliberation itself.

The most significant disagreement concerns depth of diagnosis. Allen and McCarthy (2009) represent an internal decolonizing position: the Frankfurt School's entanglement with Eurocentric developmental schemas must be confronted, but the emancipatory project of critical theory can survive the correction; Allen's *The End of Progress* (Allen 2016) calls for decolonizing critical theory's progressivist normative architecture while retaining immanent critique. Bhambra's external critique is more radical: the categories of the Frankfurt School tradition are constituted through colonial exclusions and cannot absorb postcolonial insights without fundamental transformation of the standpoint of critique itself — "epistemological justice" requires not acknowledgment of colonial histories but a rethinking of the very ground on which critique stands (Bhambra 2021).

### Subsection 2.3: Disability, Class, and Queer Axes — Is the Problem Structural?

The disability, class, and queer critiques perform a crucial analytical function: they show that the excluded capacities and identities Habermasian theory cannot accommodate are not reducible to gender and race. The common structure they expose — that the framework presupposes a normative subject who is rational, able-bodied, bourgeois, and heterosexual — suggests these exclusions are symptomatic of something foundational.

Clifford (2012) argues that the bodily presence of disabled persons in deliberative spaces constitutes a communicative act analogous to rational speech, directly challenging the linguistic-cognitive assumptions of the ideal speech situation rather than confirming them. Afsahi (2020) responds at the systemic level: the deliberative systems turn opens avenues for including cognitively disabled citizens at the institutional level even where particular forums cannot accommodate them. Lobb (2018) makes the most diagnostically pointed move: drawing on Honneth's critique of Habermas's language-theoretic framework, she argues that Fricker's two canonical forms of epistemic injustice share a speech-based metric that misses wrongs occurring before discourse participation is possible. "Prediscursive epistemic injury" names harm done to persons as knowers before they reach the threshold of discourse — operating in the pre-linguistic affective and embodied channels through which knowing begins. De Brasi and Warman (2023) extend this by identifying mechanisms of epistemic disenfranchisement that operate within formally inclusive deliberative processes, showing how substantive exclusion persists beneath procedural equality.

Warner (2002) shows how the liberal public sphere constitutes heterosexual, reproductive domesticity as the norm of legitimate public discourse, marginalizing queer identities to the private sphere where they cannot enter as publicly intelligible claims. Cloud (2018) develops the class critique: the communicative norms structuring the bourgeois public sphere encode class-specific capacities — formal education, professional discourse registers, temporal and material conditions of deliberative participation — that systematically disadvantage working-class participants.

These critiques are not simply additive. Lobb's prediscursive epistemic injury is especially significant: it establishes that exclusion precedes discourse itself, that the mechanisms through which it operates are built into the conditions of subject-formation prior to the deliberative arena. The exclusions feminist, race, disability, class, and queer critiques each identify are not incidental failures of implementation but symptomatic of what the framework presupposes about the nature of the deliberating subject.

The unresolved question is whether any adequate response requires abandoning Habermasian universalism or only deepening it. Fraser, Benhabib, and Bohman pursue immanent repair; Young proposes a substantive communicative alternative; Bhambra demands transformation of the standpoint of critique itself. Each position represents a coherent response to the structural diagnosis, yet none has achieved consensus. Section 3 examines Dussel's transmodern critique, which operates at the deepest level of this debate: not contesting Habermasian categories' application to colonial subjects but challenging the foundational categories themselves, and identifying in the victim excluded from the communication community by definition the most extreme form of the prediscursive exclusion that every tradition surveyed here has encountered.

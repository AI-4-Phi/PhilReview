## Section 4: Can the Framework be Saved? Habermasian Defenses and the Limits of Reconstruction

The critiques developed in Sections 1–3 converge on a shared structural diagnosis: that Habermasian universalism encodes the capacities of a normatively particular subject, and that this encoding operates not only at the level of historical contingency or procedural design but at the level of the framework's foundational categories. The question this section addresses is whether that diagnosis is, in principle, addressable from within. The responses surveyed here — Habermas's own proceduralist defense, the sympathetic reconstructions of Benhabib, Bohman, and Cooke, and the debate between Allen and Consani over whether normative reconstruction is possible at all — are philosophically serious interventions. The point is not that they fail as philosophical arguments, but to determine at precisely what level they succeed, and what remains outside their reach.

### Subsection 4.1: Habermas's Own Defense

Habermas's primary response to exclusion critiques distinguishes two levels at which universality is claimed. In *Between Facts and Norms* (Habermas 1996), the central proceduralist move is that legitimate deliberation requires only genuinely open procedures, not that participants share substantive values or inhabit a common lifeworld. The two-track model of deliberative democracy — informal opinion formation in civil society feeding into formal will-formation in deliberative institutions — accommodates the plurality of perspectives that critics regard as suppressed, including what Fraser (1990) calls subaltern counter-publics. In his extended 2020 interview with Czingon, Diefenbach, and Kempf (Czingon et al. 2020), Habermas maintains that critics of his universalism typically conflate two different claims: the formal-pragmatic claim that communicative competence is a universal presupposition of meaningful discourse, and substantive claims about the cultural content of the Western lifeworld. The first claim is about the conditions of intelligible speech as such; the second is particular and historically contingent. Habermas regards the former as defensible even after acknowledging the latter as relative. McCarthy (1994) converges on a structurally similar position from a comparative perspective: both Rawlsian constructivism and Habermasian reconstructivism, despite diverging in derivation and formulation, arrive at proceduralist constraints on legitimate public reasoning, which suggests that the universality claimed for those constraints is not peculiar to Habermas's European cultural location.

The decolonial response to this defense targets the distinction itself. Quijano's (2000) coloniality of power argument implies that the very conditions under which communicative competence is attributed — who counts as a rational agent capable of making and responding to validity claims — are already structured by colonial power. The formal-pragmatic distinction holds, on this view, only if the attribution of competence is itself free from colonial distortion; but it is precisely this attribution that colonial hierarchies regulate. Biswas (2022) provides the historical demonstration: in colonial India, even deliberations involving formally equal participants broke down because colonial hierarchies pervaded the conditions under which each participant's validity claims were registered. The defense, in other words, presupposes what the critique contests.

### Subsection 4.2: Sympathetic Reconstructions and Their Limits

The most philosophically developed responses to the exclusion critique are not Habermas's own but those of his sympathetic reconstructors, each of whom proposes a different way of supplementing the proceduralist framework to address a different level of the objection.

Benhabib (1992) argues that Habermas's discourse ethics can be reconstructed to preserve the concrete other alongside the generalized other — particular, embodied, relational particularity alongside the abstractly impartial standpoint. Her interactive universalism does not abandon the universalist procedural commitment but insists that it be operationalized through discourse that takes up specific perspectives rather than abstracting from them. Wright (2004) reinforces this defense from within, arguing that feminist critics who charge Habermasian impartiality with structural masculinism often conflate the Kantian framework with Habermas's dialogical transformation of it: reciprocal perspective-taking in discourse ethics already requires attending to how affected others situate themselves, which accommodates the kind of particularity that care ethics foregrounds. Cooke (2006) proposes that discourse ethics contains an implicit "utopian promise" — an anticipation of fully realized communicative inclusion — that can be made normatively productive: every existing exclusion can be measured against this implicit standard and found wanting, making the framework inherently self-reforming.

Bohman's contributions press the reconstruction in an explicitly epistemic direction. His 2006 argument is that the exclusion of marginalized groups is not merely procedurally objectionable but epistemically self-undermining: diverse perspectives generate the robustness of deliberative outcomes across different standpoints, so excluding those most affected by domination degrades the epistemic quality of deliberation for everyone. This grounds an inclusion requirement not in an appeal to fairness alone but in the deliberative system's own epistemic conditions. His reflexivity argument (Bohman 2003) adds a second lever: deliberative procedures must be capable of turning on themselves to contest their own exclusionary conditions. The procedures are not self-sealing; they can be made to scrutinize the norms of their own operation. Mendonça and Asenbaum (2025) represent the most recent and ambitious reconstruction, proposing a six-move framework — three deconstructive and three reconstructive — for positioning a decolonizing ethos at the center of deliberative democracy without abandoning its emancipatory aspirations.

These reconstructions are genuine philosophical advances. They address exclusion at the empirical level (Benhabib, Cooke) and at the procedural level (Bohman, Wright, Mendonça and Asenbaum), and they do so by expanding rather than abandoning the Habermasian framework. The difficulty — which Delanty (1997) identifies in sociological terms and which the decolonial critiques press philosophically — is that they operate within an Occidental framework of social learning that assumes the communicative community is already constituted and capable of self-reform. The decolonial critique at level (c) is not that the procedures are biased but that the very ontological boundary of the communication community — who counts as a participant capable of raising a validity claim — is already structured by colonial exclusion. Dussel's (2013) architectonic makes this precise: the discourse principle can be invoked only by those already inside the communication community, but it is the inside/outside distinction itself that the victim's analeptic claim contests. Benhabib's multicultural extension of discourse ethics is the most ambitious response to the postcolonial charge, but it addresses the question of what kind of participants the procedure should accommodate, not the prior question of how the procedure's own boundaries were drawn and by what power.

### Subsection 4.3: The Decolonial Reconstruction Debate — Where is the Line Between Repair and Replacement?

The deepest tension in the reconstructive literature is between those who hold that the Habermasian framework can be decolonized from within and those who argue that the contamination is structural and requires foundational replacement. Allen (2016) occupies the pivotal position. Her diagnosis is precise: Habermas's normative architecture requires the progressivist teleology to do the work of grounding critique — the idea that Western post-conventional rationality represents a developmental advance over traditional forms of life is not an incidental feature but a structural requirement of the theory. Without it, Habermas cannot explain why the norms arrived at through ideal discourse should command assent beyond the particular communication community within which they are reached. Allen's proposed alternative — drawing on Adorno's negative dialectics and Foucauldian genealogy — abandons the progressivist teleology while retaining the project of immanent critique, aiming to criticize domination without presupposing Eurocentric developmental standards.

Consani (2023) mounts the sharpest internal defense of Habermasian rationalism against this proposal. Her argument is that Allen's critique, while illuminating, leads to a denial of the legitimate distinction between social rationality and irrationality as normative criteria. If rationality cannot serve as a criterion — if the charge of Eurocentrism applies not only to the content of particular norms but to rationality as such — then critical theory loses the normative ground on which any critique of power must stand. Abandoning rationality does more damage to the emancipatory project than retaining some Eurocentric residue in the formulation of its criteria. The question Consani's defense exploits is not whether Allen's diagnosis is accurate but whether her proposed alternative can sustain the normative work that critical theory requires. Torres (2025) documents that the Frankfurt School itself has now begun a reckoning with this question under Stephan Lessenich's leadership of the Institut für Sozialforschung, developing a research program that explicitly confronts the Eurocentrism embedded in the tradition — a development that signals the decolonial critique's penetration to the center of the tradition it targets, but that also indicates the tension between institutional acknowledgment and philosophical resolution.

The exchange between Allen and Consani crystallizes the unresolved philosophical question with which this review concludes. Is there a position between Bohman's "epistemic inclusion" — supplementing Habermasian proceduralism with diversity requirements grounded in the framework's own epistemic standards — and Dussel's "material principle prior to discourse" — grounding ethics in the living, suffering body of the victim as a foundation that precedes and conditions any formal procedure? Bhambra (2021) argues that even sympathetic reconstructions remain within the ontological framework that generates the exclusion: "epistemological justice" requires not supplementation but a transformation of the standpoint from which critique is launched. The proceduralist response to the charge that procedures are exclusionary cannot itself be purely procedural, because the challenge is not to the content of the procedures but to the very constitution of the deliberative community as such. Whether this means that immanent repair and structural replacement represent genuinely irreducible philosophical alternatives, or whether a more radical form of reconstruction can be philosophically stable, is the question to which the conclusion turns.

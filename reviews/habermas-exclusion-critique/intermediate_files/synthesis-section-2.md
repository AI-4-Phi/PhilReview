## Section 1: Communicative Idealization and Its Discontents — What Exclusion Critiques Are Targeting

Exclusion critiques of Habermas are often misread as objections to his biographical or cultural position, or as complaints that the ideals of communicative action are simply too demanding. The critiques surveyed here are more precise than that. They target identifiable structural features of the framework: the transcendence claim at the heart of the bourgeois public sphere's self-justification, the procedural norms of the ideal speech situation, and the lifeworld concept's implicit assumption of shared symbolic ground. Understanding what, specifically, is being contested is the necessary precondition for evaluating whether the exclusions are correctable supplements or constitutive features of the framework.

### Subsection 1.1: The Public Sphere's Constitutive Exclusions

The point of departure is Habermas's own account of the bourgeois public sphere in *The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere* (Habermas 1989). Habermas acknowledges that the eighteenth-century sphere of coffeehouses, salons, and literary journals was formed by men of property, that women were largely absent from it, and that the working class occupied a different social world. His move is to argue that the normative principles this sphere enacted — openness, equal participation, reason-based argumentation — transcend the social conditions of their emergence. The exclusions are, on this view, historically contingent failures to realize ideals that were nonetheless genuinely progressive; their correction is a matter of expanding the scope of the original project. This "transcendence claim" is the pivot around which the exclusion literature turns.

Fraser's critique, developed in "Rethinking the Public Sphere" (Fraser 1990), contests the transcendence claim on four interlocking grounds. First, bracketing structural inequalities among deliberating parties does not neutralize them but amplifies them: when participants are unequal in social power, the pretense of symmetrical exchange works in favor of the more powerful. Second, insisting on a single unified public where multiple competing publics would better serve democratic contestation privileges the hegemonic norms of the dominant group under the guise of universality. Third, designating certain matters "private" and therefore outside the sphere of legitimate deliberation is not a neutral procedural act but a prior distribution of political power — the matters already settled in the interests of the dominant group are precisely those consigned to the private. Fourth, non-bourgeois counter-publics — working-class, feminist, Black — are suppressed or marginalized in Habermas's historical account. Fraser proposes "subaltern counterpublics" as the practical and theoretical response: arenas where dominated groups reformulate identities and needs, contesting dominant interpretations rather than seeking access to a sphere that was constituted against them.

Landes's historical study of women and the French Revolution strengthens Fraser's case by grounding it in specific archival evidence (Landes 1988). Landes argues that the republican public sphere was not merely accidentally exclusive of women: it was constitutively defined against aristocratic femininity, so that the ideal of rational public discourse was actively constructed through the repudiation of feminized modes of political participation. This is not a failure to apply a valid norm; it is a case where the norm was forged in the act of exclusion.

Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer (2015) extend the analysis to racial exclusion in the American context. They argue that Habermas's account of the public sphere suppresses the history of Black Americans' systematic exclusion from deliberative spaces and that the "racial counterpublic" developed by Black Americans was not an organic supplement to a basically open sphere but an alternative constructed under conditions of racial domination — precisely because Habermas's public sphere was not normatively separable from its racial constitution. Biswas (2022) provides an empirical test case from a different colonial context: a deliberative exchange in colonial India in 1888 in which two participants — formally deliberating as equals — nonetheless experienced communicative breakdown because colonial hierarchies pervaded the shared lifeworld to which Habermasian theory would have attributed commensurability. The historical record does not support the transcendence claim even on the framework's own procedural terms.

### Subsection 1.2: The Procedural Exclusions — Norms of Argumentation as Sites of Domination

If Subsection 1.1 disputes the historical-empirical premises of Habermas's transcendence claim, the second level of critique goes further: it argues that the norms of deliberation themselves — impartiality, rational argumentation, symmetrical participation — are not neutral procedural requirements but encode the communicative styles and epistemic dispositions of the dominant social group, thereby systematically disadvantaging those whose social position deviates from the unmarked norm.

Young's *Inclusion and Democracy* (Young 2000) develops this argument with the most systematic philosophical care. Deliberative democracy's privileged norms of rational, dispassionate argument code as "partial" or "emotional" the communicative styles characteristic of marginalized groups. Young proposes "communicative democracy" as an alternative, which legitimizes greeting, rhetoric, and narrative alongside formal argument as modes of valid political communication. The critique is not that rationality is bad but that the deliberative model treats a particular form of rationality — associated historically with educated bourgeois men — as the universal standard, while encoding alternatives as deficient. Allen's 2012 analysis of the "unforced force of the better argument" makes this precise: Habermas's central normative claim is that deliberative outcomes gain legitimacy because they emerge from the non-coercive pressure of the better argument alone. Allen argues that this claim underestimates how power relations structure the very conditions under which arguments are assessed — who counts as a competent speaker, which standards of "better" are brought to bear, which contributions are heard as contributions and which as noise. The force is not force-free; it operates within power-laden communicative contexts that racial and other hierarchies structure.

Pajnik (2006) identifies a related problem at the level of formal pragmatics. Habermas's analysis of communicative action is gender-blind: it treats the formal conditions of speech acts as transcending the gendered structures of the lifeworld in which they are performed. But the lifeworld's gendered division of care labor, emotional expression, and rational discourse means that what counts as a valid communicative act is never socially innocent. Drake (2023) applies this structural critique to systemic racism: deliberative theory, including its Habermasian variants, tends to understand racism as a problem of distorted communication or individual prejudice rather than as a structural feature of the social system that pervades the conditions under which deliberation takes place. No procedural reform at the level of discourse norms alone can address this.

Fricker's *Epistemic Injustice* (Fricker 2007) provides the most analytically precise tools for specifying how procedural exclusions operate. Fricker distinguishes two wrongs: testimonial injustice, in which identity prejudice causes a hearer to deflate a speaker's credibility; and hermeneutical injustice, in which gaps in collective interpretive resources prevent marginalized groups from making sense of or articulating their own experience. Both wrongs damage subjects specifically in their capacity as knowers — and both operate exactly in the deliberative spaces Habermasian theory treats as normed by communicative rationality. Testimonial injustice describes the credibility deficit that prevents marginalized speakers from achieving parity in deliberative exchange even when they are formally included; hermeneutical injustice describes a prior condition in which the conceptual resources for their experience to enter discourse at all are absent from the shared hermeneutical stock. Dieleman (2015) draws the connection explicitly: epistemic justice is not an external supplement to deliberative legitimacy but a precondition of it in Habermasian terms. A deliberative procedure that systematically deflates the credibility of some speakers fails its own normative standard.

### Subsection 1.3: The Lifeworld's Hidden Particularity

The deepest level of the critique in this section targets the lifeworld concept itself. Volume 2 of *The Theory of Communicative Action* (Habermas 1987) introduces the lifeworld as the shared symbolic background — the stock of implicit assumptions, communicative competences, and cultural meanings — within which communicative action takes place. The lifeworld provides the horizon of mutual understanding that makes validity claims intelligible and redeemable. Without some such shared background, there is nothing to orient communicative rationality toward. The problem is that the lifeworld's shared character is assumed rather than established: Habermas treats intersubjective shareability as a formal feature of the concept rather than as an empirical achievement that structural inequalities can prevent.

Benhabib's *Situating the Self* (Benhabib 1992) identifies the philosophical mechanism of this problem. Habermas's discourse ethics requires participants to adopt the standpoint of the "generalized other" — an abstract, disembodied rational being from whose perspective universal norms can be justified. This abstraction systematically suppresses the standpoint of the "concrete other" — the particular individual with a specific history, relational context, and embodied life. What feminist theory foregrounds as the condition of genuine communicative encounter, discourse ethics abstracts away as the condition of universal justification. The generalized other is not no one; it is someone whose particularity has been normalized into invisibility.

McNay (2003) identifies a related tension in feminist attempts to retain the Habermasian framework while incorporating narrative identity. The embodied, relational self that feminist theory values resists the abstraction that communicative procedures require: narrative identity is constituted through specific histories and relationships, while discourse ethics requires participants to step back from these to the level of universalizable principles. This tension, McNay argues, is not resolved but papered over by Benhabib's "interactive universalism."

Delanty (1997) locates the problem in Habermas's account of societal rationalization. Habermas's universalism is culturally tied to the developmental logic of Occidental rationalism: the differentiation of value spheres, the emergence of post-conventional moral consciousness, and the institutional forms of modern democracy are presented as universal achievements rather than as historically specific forms shaped by European experience. Gunaratne (2006) demonstrates this empirically through a comparative survey of Buddhist, Confucian, and Islamic deliberative traditions: these traditions embody substantive commitments to reasoned public discourse that Habermas's framework cannot recognize as instances of communicative rationality because they do not conform to its formal-pragmatic specifications. The lifeworld that Habermasian theory treats as the universal background condition for discourse turns out to presuppose a particular symbolic world.

Biswas (2022) connects this to the colonial context: under colonial conditions, participants may share a nominal discursive space while inhabiting incommensurable lifeworlds structured by relations of domination. The assumption that a shared lifeworld can be presupposed for purposes of communicative action is precisely what colonial hierarchy disrupts. The deliberative breakdown he documents in colonial India is not a case of bad faith or strategic action; it is a case where the preconditions of communicative action — a commensurable lifeworld — do not obtain because colonial power has made commensurability impossible.

The upshot is that the lifeworld's presupposed shareability encodes the social position of those who inhabit a world that has been organized around their interests and communicative styles. For those whose social worlds have been formed under conditions of domination — colonized peoples, racialized subjects, disabled persons whose embodied histories the lifeworld's normative stock does not represent — the lifeworld is not a shared symbolic resource but a space constituted partly through their exclusion. Lobb (2018) specifies the mechanism at the pre-discursive level: drawing on Honneth's critique of Habermas's language-theoretic framework, she identifies "prediscursive epistemic injury" as a harm that occurs before discourse participation is possible. Fricker's canonical forms of epistemic injustice, like Habermasian discourse ethics itself, share a speech-based metric that misses wrongs done to persons in their capacity as knowers before they have the chance to speak. The exclusion, in other words, precedes the discourse it is supposed to enter.

These three levels of critique — historical-empirical, procedural-normative, and conceptual-foundational — are analytically distinct but reinforce one another. The historical critique contests the empirical record on which the transcendence claim rests; the procedural critique shows that the norms themselves are not neutral even if the transcendence claim were historically accurate; and the lifeworld critique reveals that the conceptual conditions for communicative action encode a particular form of social being that structural domination disrupts. Together, they establish that exclusion from Habermasian communicative parity is not an accident of implementation but a product of theoretical choices made at each level of the framework. The question whether any of these choices can be revised without abandoning the framework's core commitments is what Sections 2 through 4 investigate.

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses critiques of Habermasian communicative action and public sphere theory that identify exclusions along axes beyond gender, race, and colonial positionality: disability, class, sexuality (queer theory), and epistemic injustice. These critiques share the diagnostic claim that Habermas's normative idealizations -- ideal speech situation, communicative rationality, the bourgeois public sphere -- presuppose particular embodied, cognitive, socioeconomic, and heteronormative capacities that are not universally distributed.

The disability strand is the most philosophically developed among these critiques. Theorists from Stacy Clifford (2012) to Afsoun Afsahi (2020) and Thomas Schramme (2021) argue that deliberative democracy's requirements for intelligible rational speech systematically exclude persons with profound cognitive or communicative disabilities. Clifford proposes that the bodily presence of disabled participants itself carries communicative force analogous to rational speech acts, challenging the linguistic-cognitive assumptions underpinning Habermasian deliberation. Schramme argues for including "minority minds" -- those with atypical cognitive profiles -- via discursive accommodation rather than standard rational-speech models. Afsahi, working within the systemic turn in deliberative democracy, argues that disability can be incorporated at the system level even when excluded from individual deliberative episodes.

The epistemic injustice strand, anchored by Miranda Fricker's (2007) framework of testimonial and hermeneutical injustice, connects most directly to the Habermasian critique. Fricker's account shows how identity prejudice deflates the epistemic credibility of structurally marginalized speakers -- a mechanism that operates precisely in the discourse arenas Habermas treats as normed by communicative rationality. Susan Dieleman (2015) argues that epistemic justice is a precondition of democratic legitimacy in Habermasian terms. Amandine Catala's Democracy, Trust, and Epistemic Justice (2015) and her 2025 book The Dynamics of Epistemic Injustice systematize these connections, while De Brasi and Warman (2023) identify mechanisms of "epistemic disenfranchisement" within deliberative processes. Andrea Lobb (2018) extends Fricker by drawing on Honneth's critique of Habermas's language-theoretic framework to identify "prediscursive epistemic injury" -- harm that occurs before discourse even begins. Petr Zapletal (2025) specifically connects class-based epistemic injustice to deliberative democratic assumptions.

The class critique draws on Negt and Kluge's (1972/1993) proletarian public sphere as an alternative to Habermas's bourgeois model, arguing that the public sphere's historical genesis as a bourgeois institution structurally encodes class-specific communicative norms. Dana Cloud (2018) extends this via standpoint theory. The queer/sexuality strand is the least developed in direct philosophical engagement with Habermas; Michael Warner's (2002) account of queer counterpublics -- built partly against Habermas -- is the key reference. Nussbaum's (2006) capabilities approach offers a disability critique of contractarianism that, while not directly targeting Habermas, challenges the rational-competence presuppositions shared by contractarian and communicative-action frameworks.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These critiques collectively reveal that Habermas's universalist aspirations are undermined not only by feminist and postcolonial exclusions (covered in other domains) but by a more fundamental set of normative presuppositions about rational-communicative capacity, socioeconomic access, and heteronormative privacy norms. They raise the question whether these exclusions are contingent failures to implement Habermas's framework correctly, or are symptomatic of deeper structural problems with universalist discourse ethics. This question bears directly on how the literature review frames the overall critique of Habermas as exclusionary.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Philosophically developed queer-theory engagement specifically with Habermas's lifeworld or ideal speech situation (as opposed to the public sphere concept) remains thin -- Warner and related figures work primarily against the public sphere concept, not communicative action theory. A systematic account of how hermeneutical injustice maps onto Habermasian discourse ethics (as distinct from deliberative democracy) is largely missing; most work focuses on deliberative democracy rather than communicative action specifically. Papers by Tremain directly targeting disability and Habermas's ideal speech situation could not be verified through search scripts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The epistemic injustice strand (Fricker, Dieleman, Catala, De Brasi/Warman, Lobb) offers the most philosophically precise tools for diagnosing how Habermas's procedural idealizations fail marginalized groups; synthesis should foreground this connection before moving to disability and class critiques, which are more empirically-oriented. The key structural question -- whether exclusions are remediable corrections or indicators of deeper failure -- should organize the section.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Epistemic injustice critique: 5 papers - Fricker's framework applied to deliberative democracy shows how structural credibility deficits undermine communicative parity
- Disability and deliberation: 4 papers - Exclusion of non-normative cognitive/communicative capacities from ideal speech situation
- Class and proletarian counterpublics: 2 papers - Bourgeois origins of public sphere encode class-specific communicative norms
- Queer/sexuality counterpublics: 1 paper - Warner's queer counterpublics challenge heteronormative assumptions in public sphere theory
- Capabilities critique: 1 paper - Nussbaum's challenge to rational-competence presuppositions in liberal theory including Habermas

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker distinguishes two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial injustice, in which identity prejudice causes hearers to deflate a speaker's credibility, and hermeneutical injustice, in which gaps in collective interpretive resources prevent marginalized groups from making sense of or communicating their own experience. Both wrongs harm subjects specifically in their capacity as knowers.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for understanding how structural power asymmetries undermine epistemic participation -- the mechanism by which Habermasian communicative parity is systematically violated for marginalized groups. Testimonial injustice describes exactly the credibility-deficit that prevents parity in deliberative exchanges; hermeneutical injustice describes the prior condition in which marginalized experience lacks the conceptual resources to enter discourse at all.

  POSITION: Establishes the core framework of epistemic injustice that subsequent literature applies to Habermasian deliberative democracy.

  abstract = {Abstract Justice is one of the oldest and most central themes of philosophy, but sometimes we would do well to focus instead on injustice. In epistemology, the very idea that there is a first-order ethical dimension to our epistemic practices — the idea that there is such a thing as epistemic justice — remains obscure until we adjust the philosophical lens so that we see through to the negative space that is epistemic injustice. This book argues that there is a distinctively epistemic genus of injustice, in which someone is wronged specifically in their capacity as a knower, wronged therefore in a capacity essential to human value. The book identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. In doing so, it charts the ethical dimension of two fundamental epistemic practices: gaining knowledge by being told and making sense of our social experiences. As the account unfolds, the book travels through a range of philosophical problems. Thus, the book finds an analysis of social power; an account of prejudicial stereotypes; a characterization of two hybrid intellectual-ethical virtues; a revised account of the State of Nature used in genealogical explanations of the concept of knowledge; a discussion of objectification and ‘silencing’; and a framework for a virtue epistemological account of testimony. The book reveals epistemic injustice as a potent yet largely silent dimension of discrimination, analyses the wrong it perpetrates, and constructs two hybrid ethical-intellectual virtues of epistemic justice which aim to forestall it.},

  doi = {10.1111/hypa.12173},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dieleman argues that epistemic justice -- specifically overcoming testimonial and hermeneutical injustice -- is a necessary precondition of democratic legitimacy in a Habermasian sense. Democratic procedures that systematically deflate the credibility of marginalized speakers fail their own normative standards, because legitimate democratic outcomes require that all affected voices carry appropriate epistemic weight.

  RELEVANCE: This paper most directly bridges Fricker's epistemic injustice framework and Habermasian deliberative democracy, arguing that the two frameworks are mutually implicated: Habermas's legitimacy conditions require epistemic justice as a prior condition. Central to mapping how epistemic injustice constitutes a distinctively Habermasian critique.

  POSITION: Situates epistemic justice as internal to, rather than external criticism of, the normative standards of deliberative democracy.

  abstract = {The deliberative turn in political philosophy sees theorists attempting to ground democratic legitimacy in free, rational, and public deliberation among citizens. However, feminist theorists have criticized prominent accounts of deliberative democracy, and of the public sphere that is its site, for being too exclusionary. Iris Marion Young, Nancy Fraser, and Seyla Benhabib show that deliberative democrats generally fail to attend to substantive inclusion in their conceptions of deliberative space, even though they endorse formal inclusion. If we take these criticisms seriously, we are tasked with articulating a substantively inclusive account of deliberation. I argue in this article that enriching existing theories of deliberative democracy with Fricker's conception of epistemic in/justice yields two specific benefits. First, it enables us to detect instances of epistemic injustice, and therefore failures of inclusion, within deliberative spaces. Second, it can act as a model for constructing deliberative spaces that are more inclusive and therefore better able to ground democratic legitimacy.},

Credibility deficits not only wrong individual speakers but undermine the social conditions of epistemic cooperation on which legitimate collective will-formation depends.

  RELEVANCE: Connects epistemic injustice to democratic trust, a relation that is central to Habermas's account of legitimate democratic will-formation. Shows how epistemic injustice has systemic, not merely individual, consequences for communicative action.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Catala develops a systematic account of epistemic power and agency through the dynamics of epistemic injustice -- its multiple forms, sites, and mechanisms. The book applies standpoint theory to questions including deliberative impasses, colonial memory, and the marginalization of intellectually disabled people and autistics, developing a unified account of how epistemic injustice operates across diverse contexts.

  RELEVANCE: The inclusion of intellectually disabled people and autistics as cases of epistemic marginalization makes this directly relevant to both the disability and epistemic injustice strands of the domain. The analysis of deliberative impasses connects to Habermasian communicative action directly.

  POSITION: Provides the most recent and comprehensive account of epistemic injustice dynamics, including disability-specific applications.

 Epistemic injustice is inherently connected to epistemic power and epistemic agency: understanding and addressing the former allows us to better understand and address the latter, and vice versa. Yet, despite vast and rich discussions of epistemic injustice, which often invoke the notions of epistemic power and epistemic agency, both notions remain undertheorized and hence largely elusive. This book offers a systematic account of epistemic power and agency by turning to the dynamics of epistemic injustice—that is, the many forms epistemic injustice can take, the different sites and mechanisms through which it operates, and the various transformations consequently required to cultivate greater epistemic justice. Adopting standpoint theory both as a theory and as a methodology, the book focuses on several pressing social questions, such as deliberative impasses in divided societies, colonial memory, academic migration, the underrepresentation of members of non-dominant groups in certain fields, and the marginalization of minoritized minds, such as intellectually disabled people and Autistics. By analyzing these social questions through the lens of the dynamics of epistemic injustice, the book develops a systematic account of epistemic power and agency.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: De Brasi and Warman identify two undertheorized mechanisms of epistemic exclusion within deliberative democratic processes -- discursive injustice and testimonial void -- that operate alongside Fricker's canonical forms of epistemic injustice. They argue these mechanisms produce "epistemic disenfranchisement," a failure of substantive (as distinct from formal) democratic enfranchisement.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the connection between epistemic injustice and deliberative democracy, introducing the concept of epistemic disenfranchisement that maps precisely onto Habermas's concern with communicative parity. Shows that even formally inclusive deliberative procedures can systematically exclude marginalized speakers.

  POSITION: Extends and refines the Fricker-deliberative democracy connection with new mechanisms of exclusion.

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore some links between deliberative democracy, natural testimony, and epistemic injustice. We hope to highlight the exclusionary effects of some cases of testimony-related epistemic injustice within the deliberative democratic framework and, in particular, two subtle ways of epistemic injustice that are not often highlighted in the political domain. In other words, we hope to highlight two specific mechanisms of epistemic exclusion within the democratic deliberative process that are not explicitly noticed in the relevant literature. In section 1, we present the deliberative model of democracy and the deliberative process. We then introduce the notion of epistemic (dis)enfranchisement, which we distinguish from formal enfranchisement, and explain the role that natural testimony plays in establishing citizens‘ epistemic enfranchisement. In section 2, we introduce Fricker‘s notion of testimonial injustice and two further testimony-related forms of epistemic injustice which seem to have been largely neglected in the debate so far, namely, discursive injustice and testimonial void. We also point out negative epistemic consequences of positive identity-prejudicial stereotypes. In section 3, we argue that these testimony-related forms of epistemic injustice can lead to epistemic disenfranchisement, which, we note, is an obstacle to deliberative democracy that warrants serious consideration.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taking a cue from Honneth's critique of Habermas's language-theoretic framework in discourse ethics, Lobb argues that Fricker's two canonical forms of epistemic injustice (testimonial and hermeneutical) share a speech-based metric that misses pre-discursive epistemic harm. She proposes a third category -- prediscursive epistemic injury -- for wrongs that occur before discourse participation is possible, drawing on recognition theory.

  RELEVANCE: Directly engages the Honneth-Habermas axis in the context of epistemic injustice, arguing that Habermas's linguistic framework of discourse ethics generates a blind spot analogous to the one Fricker inherits from it. Establishes that the exclusions at stake in Habermasian frameworks operate even before deliberation formally begins.

  POSITION: Bridges epistemic injustice literature and the Honneth-Habermas debate, revealing a pre-discursive dimension of exclusion that Habermasian discourse ethics cannot capture.

Taking a first cue from Honneth’s critique of the limitations of the “language-theoretic framework” in Habermas’ discourse ethics, it floats the idea that the two categories of Fricker’s groundbreaking analysis—testimonial and hermeneutical injustice—likewise lean towards a speech-based metric (equating harm to the capacities to know with compromise to the capacity to speak of what one knows). If we accept, however, that there are also implicit, preverbal, affective, and embodied ways of knowing and channels of knowledge transmission, this warrants an expansion of Fricker’s original concept. By drawing on Honneth’s recognition theory (particularly his Winnicottian-inspired account of ‘first order’ recognition and basic trust), I argue it is possible to extend the account of epistemic injustice beyond Fricker’s two central categories, to glimpse yet another register of serious “wrong done to someone specifically in their capacity as a knower.” I define this harm as prediscursive epistemic injury and offer two central cases to illustrate this additional form of epistemic injustice.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Clifford argues that deliberative democracy harbors a tension between full inclusion and intelligible speech that typically sacrifices people with profound cognitive disabilities.

  RELEVANCE: Directly challenges the ideal-speech-situation assumption that communicative participation requires normative rational-linguistic capacities, showing this exclusion is unnecessary and can be reconceived. Key text for the disability critique of Habermasian deliberative norms.

  POSITION: Proposes that Habermasian deliberative requirements can be revised to accommodate non-normative communicative capacities rather than simply excluding them.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Afsahi argues that the systemic turn in deliberative democracy -- which focuses on the interdependence of institutions and individuals within deliberative systems rather than individual forums -- opens avenues for including cognitively disabled citizens. Institutional design changes that normalize disabled participation suggest the deliberative system can accommodate disability even when particular forums cannot.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a partial defense of deliberative democracy against disability critiques by shifting focus from the ideal-speech-situation at the level of individual deliberation to the systemic level. Provides a response to Clifford and Schramme that the research project should consider when assessing whether these exclusions reveal a fundamental structural problem or an implementation failure.

  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2021.2020550},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schramme argues that standard discourse practices exclude "minority minds" -- persons with atypical cognitive profiles including autism, intellectual disability, and severe mental illness -- because these practices presuppose normative communicative capacities that are unevenly distributed. He proposes discursive accommodation as an alternative to exclusion, arguing that discourse can be restructured to include diverse cognitive profiles.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether Habermasian discourse practices presuppose normative cognitive capacities, and whether accommodation can rectify this without abandoning the framework. Engages the tension between the universalist ambitions of discourse ethics and the particularity of communicative competence.

  POSITION: Argues for reformist accommodation of minority minds within discourse practices rather than wholesale rejection of deliberative norms.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT It is widely assumed that severe mental disabilities prevent relevant deliberative capacities from developing or persisting. Accordingly, excluding many people with mental disabilities from discourse practices seems justified. Against this common assumption I wish to show that the general exclusion is not justified and amounts to a form of epistemic injustice, as theorised by Miranda Fricker. The received norm of capable deliberators is connected to a specific model of deliberation. I introduce an alternative model of deliberation, which I dub the joint effort model. According to this model, people with minority minds (as I call them) add valuable cognitive diversity to the process of deliberation, which is a relevant element of epistemic improvement. In this part of the argument I rely on empirically informed theoretical work by Hélène Landemore. I scrutinise the minimal requirements of capable deliberators from the perspective of a joint effort model of deliberation, and I highlight specific beneficial contributions people with minority minds can make to discourse practices. I will argue that people with minority minds can be presumptively deemed capable deliberators and that therefore their general exclusion is unjustified.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Nussbaum argues that the social contract tradition -- which requires parties to the contract to be roughly equal in power and rationality -- cannot account for justice toward persons with cognitive disabilities, non-citizens, and animals.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on contractarianism rather than Habermas directly, Nussbaum's critique applies to any framework that conditions full moral and political standing on rational-communicative capacity -- the same presupposition that disability critiques of the ideal speech situation target. Provides the most developed capability-based alternative to rationality-presupposing frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Warner argues that publics are constituted through discourse that addresses a self-organizing social entity rather than a pre-given audience; counterpublics are publics formed in opposition to exclusion from the dominant public sphere. Queer counterpublics -- organized around non-normative sexual identities -- demonstrate that the liberal public sphere encodes heteronormativity: it constitutes a privatized sexuality as the norm of legitimate public discourse, marginalizing queerness to the private sphere.

  RELEVANCE: Warner's queer counterpublics directly challenge Habermas's public/private distinction and the heteronormative assumptions embedded in Habermas's lifeworld concept. The dominant public sphere's encoding of normative sexuality is precisely the kind of exclusion that the research project's attention to non-gender axes of exclusion should address.

Against a relativist tendency in these critiques, I argue here for an alternative, materialist model of radically democratic counterpublicity as a standard for the adjudication of a public’s fidelity to the interests of those it hails. To this end, I draw from Negt and Kluge’s description of proletarian public spheres and Lukács’ theory of mediation to theorise, describe, explain and intervene as political actors in working-class public spheres. We must retain the ability to fathom a concept of publicness tied to a socialist, anti-capitalist political project.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zapletal argues that epistemic injustice discourse, while focused on colonialism, ethnicity, and gender, neglects class-based epistemic exclusion. Deliberative democracy presupposes rational communication and consensus on discussion rules, but these presuppositions exclude subordinated classes who lack the education that transmits dominant communicative skills -- an argument that intersects Fricker's framework with class analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the gap in epistemic injustice literature regarding class, connecting Fricker's framework to the class critique of Habermasian deliberative democracy. The argument that deliberative presuppositions encode class-specific communicative skills maps directly onto the ideal-speech-situation critique.

  POSITION: Extends epistemic injustice frameworks to class by arguing that working-class exclusion from deliberation is epistemically, not only materially, grounded.

  abstract = {In examining epistemic injustice as outlined by Fricker, I highlight its conceptual shortcomings and propose a synthesis that includes class-based inequalities. Philosophical ideas and sociological theories share similar notions of power, as found in Foucault’s analysis, Fricker’s concept of epistemic justice, and Marxist critical theories. Yet discourse on epistemic injustice too often neglects the experiences of subordinated social classes, necessitating a framework that acknowledges how they are excluded.

While most research focuses on colonialism, ethnicity, and gender, class remains underexplored. Fricker argues that certain groups face discrimination through the availability of limited conceptual resources, stigmatization, and marginalization. This hinders their understanding of political conditions. If class epistemic injustice is widely condemned, do we also grant credibility to manual workers and those living in precarious circumstances? 
Deliberative democracy presupposes rational communication and consensus on discussion rules, but these can exclude subjugated classes lacking the education that transmits dominant communicative skills. Consequently, they remain marginalized. A political-sociological approach would address structural inequalities and highlight the ways dominant classes sustain privilege. By acknowledging and integrating the contributions of all social class, we can build more equitable frameworks that advance our understanding of epistemic injustice across the board.},

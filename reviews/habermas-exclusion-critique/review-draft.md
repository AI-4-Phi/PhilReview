## Introduction

Jürgen Habermas's theory of communicative action is among the most explicit attempts in twentieth-century political philosophy to ground democratic legitimacy and emancipatory politics in the conditions of rational discourse itself. By deriving normative ideals from the formal-pragmatic presuppositions of speech — validity claims redeemable only through the uncoerced exchange of reasons, formal equality among participants, and a shared communicative orientation toward mutual understanding — Habermas proposed a universalist framework immune, in principle, to the particularism of any given culture, class, or historical moment (Habermas 1984; Habermas 1990). The bourgeois public sphere, however historically compromised by class and gender exclusion, was held to embody normative principles that transcend their origins (Habermas 1989). This "transcendence claim" — that the emancipatory ideals of communicative rationality are separable from the exclusionary social conditions of their historical emergence — is the contested center of a sustained and multi-stranded body of critique.

The paradox driving this review is that a framework explicitly designed to ground equal participation has generated sustained objections from feminist, postcolonial, race-critical, and decolonial standpoints, each charging not merely that it fails in practice but that its constitutive assumptions encode the social position of a particular kind of unmarked subject. Fraser (1990) identified four interlocking failures: the ideal of bracketing social inequalities amplifies rather than neutralizes them; a single unified public sphere serves hegemony rather than contestation; the category of "private" interests already reflects dominant settlements; and non-bourgeois counter-publics are rendered invisible. These objections have since been extended and deepened by critiques operating at three analytically distinct levels: the empirical-historical (who was in fact excluded from the bourgeois public sphere and why), the procedural-normative (how the ideals of impartial rational argumentation themselves function to exclude), and the foundational (whether the very concept of communicative rationality, and the account of modernity that sustains it, encode a Eurocentric epistemology that cannot be repaired from within).

This review moves through those three levels. The first section establishes what in Habermas's framework the critiques are actually targeting — the ideal speech situation, the universalization and discourse principles of discourse ethics, the lifeworld concept, and the normative reading of the public sphere. Sections two and three survey the major traditions of exclusion critique — feminist, race-critical, disability-theoretic, and decolonial — comparatively, tracing the convergent structural diagnosis of exclusion while attending to the divergences in proposed alternatives. The review culminates in a detailed treatment of Enrique Dussel's transmodern critique, which shares the feminist and race critiques' structural diagnosis but operates at a deeper level: not merely contesting the application of Habermasian categories to colonial subjects but challenging the foundational categories themselves. For Dussel, the victim of the modern world-system — those excluded from the communication community by the structures of colonial domination — issues an analeptic claim from exteriority that the framework's procedural architecture cannot register (Dussel 1997; Dussel 2013). Section four assesses whether sympathetic reconstructions of Habermas's framework can absorb the force of these critiques. The central unresolved tension throughout is whether exclusion from communicative equality is an incidental defect, correctable by supplementation, or a structural feature requiring foundational revision or replacement.

## Section 1: Communicative Idealization and Its Discontents: What Exclusion Critiques Are Targeting

Exclusion critiques of Habermas are often misread as objections to his biographical or cultural position, or as complaints that the ideals of communicative action are simply too demanding. The critiques surveyed here are more precise than that. They target identifiable structural features of the framework: the transcendence claim at the heart of the bourgeois public sphere's self-justification, the procedural norms of the ideal speech situation, and the lifeworld concept's implicit assumption of shared symbolic ground. Understanding what, specifically, is being contested is the necessary precondition for evaluating whether the exclusions are correctable supplements or constitutive features of the framework.

### 1.1 The Public Sphere's Constitutive Exclusions

The point of departure is Habermas's own account of the bourgeois public sphere in *The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere* (Habermas 1989). Habermas acknowledges that the eighteenth-century sphere of coffeehouses, salons, and literary journals was formed by men of property, that women were largely absent from it, and that the working class occupied a different social world. His move is to argue that the normative principles this sphere enacted — openness, equal participation, reason-based argumentation — transcend the social conditions of their emergence. The exclusions are, on this view, historically contingent failures to realize ideals that were nonetheless genuinely progressive; their correction is a matter of expanding the scope of the original project. This "transcendence claim" is the pivot around which the exclusion literature turns.

Fraser's critique, developed in "Rethinking the Public Sphere" (Fraser 1990), contests the transcendence claim on four interlocking grounds. First, bracketing structural inequalities among deliberating parties does not neutralize them but amplifies them: when participants are unequal in social power, the pretense of symmetrical exchange works in favor of the more powerful. Second, insisting on a single unified public where multiple competing publics would better serve democratic contestation privileges the hegemonic norms of the dominant group under the guise of universality. Third, designating certain matters "private" and therefore outside the sphere of legitimate deliberation is not a neutral procedural act but a prior distribution of political power — the matters already settled in the interests of the dominant group are precisely those consigned to the private. Fourth, non-bourgeois counter-publics — working-class, feminist, Black — are suppressed or marginalized in Habermas's historical account. Fraser proposes "subaltern counterpublics" as the practical and theoretical response: arenas where dominated groups reformulate identities and needs, contesting dominant interpretations rather than seeking access to a sphere that was constituted against them.

Landes's historical study of women and the French Revolution strengthens Fraser's case by grounding it in specific archival evidence (Landes 1988). Landes argues that the republican public sphere was not merely accidentally exclusive of women: it was constitutively defined against aristocratic femininity, so that the ideal of rational public discourse was actively constructed through the repudiation of feminized modes of political participation. This is not a failure to apply a valid norm; it is a case where the norm was forged in the act of exclusion.

Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer (2015) extend the analysis to racial exclusion in the American context. They argue that Habermas's account of the public sphere suppresses the history of Black Americans' systematic exclusion from deliberative spaces and that the "racial counterpublic" developed by Black Americans was not an organic supplement to a basically open sphere but an alternative constructed under conditions of racial domination — precisely because Habermas's public sphere was not normatively separable from its racial constitution. Biswas (2022) provides an empirical test case from a different colonial context: a deliberative exchange in colonial India in 1888 in which two participants — formally deliberating as equals — nonetheless experienced communicative breakdown because colonial hierarchies pervaded the shared lifeworld to which Habermasian theory would have attributed commensurability. The historical record does not support the transcendence claim even on the framework's own procedural terms.

### 1.2 The Procedural Exclusions: Norms of Argumentation as Sites of Domination

If Subsection 1.1 disputes the historical-empirical premises of Habermas's transcendence claim, the second level of critique goes further: it argues that the norms of deliberation themselves — impartiality, rational argumentation, symmetrical participation — are not neutral procedural requirements but encode the communicative styles and epistemic dispositions of the dominant social group, thereby systematically disadvantaging those whose social position deviates from the unmarked norm.

Young's *Inclusion and Democracy* (Young 2000) develops this argument with the most systematic philosophical care. Deliberative democracy's privileged norms of rational, dispassionate argument code as "partial" or "emotional" the communicative styles characteristic of marginalized groups. Young proposes "communicative democracy" as an alternative, which legitimizes greeting, rhetoric, and narrative alongside formal argument as modes of valid political communication. The critique is not that rationality is bad but that the deliberative model treats a particular form of rationality — associated historically with educated bourgeois men — as the universal standard, while encoding alternatives as deficient. Allen's 2012 analysis of the "unforced force of the better argument" makes this precise: Habermas's central normative claim is that deliberative outcomes gain legitimacy because they emerge from the non-coercive pressure of the better argument alone. Allen argues that this claim underestimates how power relations structure the very conditions under which arguments are assessed — who counts as a competent speaker, which standards of "better" are brought to bear, which contributions are heard as contributions and which as noise. The force is not force-free; it operates within power-laden communicative contexts that racial and other hierarchies structure.

Pajnik (2006) identifies a related problem at the level of formal pragmatics. Habermas's analysis of communicative action is gender-blind: it treats the formal conditions of speech acts as transcending the gendered structures of the lifeworld in which they are performed. But the lifeworld's gendered division of care labor, emotional expression, and rational discourse means that what counts as a valid communicative act is never socially innocent. Drake (2023) applies this structural critique to systemic racism: deliberative theory, including its Habermasian variants, tends to understand racism as a problem of distorted communication or individual prejudice rather than as a structural feature of the social system that pervades the conditions under which deliberation takes place. No procedural reform at the level of discourse norms alone can address this.

Fricker's *Epistemic Injustice* (Fricker 2007) provides the most analytically precise tools for specifying how procedural exclusions operate. Fricker distinguishes two wrongs: testimonial injustice, in which identity prejudice causes a hearer to deflate a speaker's credibility; and hermeneutical injustice, in which gaps in collective interpretive resources prevent marginalized groups from making sense of or articulating their own experience. Both wrongs damage subjects specifically in their capacity as knowers — and both operate exactly in the deliberative spaces Habermasian theory treats as normed by communicative rationality. Testimonial injustice describes the credibility deficit that prevents marginalized speakers from achieving parity in deliberative exchange even when they are formally included; hermeneutical injustice describes a prior condition in which the conceptual resources for their experience to enter discourse at all are absent from the shared hermeneutical stock. Dieleman (2015) draws the connection explicitly: epistemic justice is not an external supplement to deliberative legitimacy but a precondition of it in Habermasian terms. A deliberative procedure that systematically deflates the credibility of some speakers fails its own normative standard.

### 1.3 The Lifeworld's Hidden Particularity

The deepest level of the critique in this section targets the lifeworld concept itself. Volume 2 of *The Theory of Communicative Action* (Habermas 1987) introduces the lifeworld as the shared symbolic background — the stock of implicit assumptions, communicative competences, and cultural meanings — within which communicative action takes place. The lifeworld provides the horizon of mutual understanding that makes validity claims intelligible and redeemable. Without some such shared background, there is nothing to orient communicative rationality toward. The problem is that the lifeworld's shared character is assumed rather than established: Habermas treats intersubjective shareability as a formal feature of the concept rather than as an empirical achievement that structural inequalities can prevent.

Benhabib's *Situating the Self* (Benhabib 1992) identifies the philosophical mechanism of this problem. Habermas's discourse ethics requires participants to adopt the standpoint of the "generalized other" — an abstract, disembodied rational being from whose perspective universal norms can be justified. This abstraction systematically suppresses the standpoint of the "concrete other" — the particular individual with a specific history, relational context, and embodied life. What feminist theory foregrounds as the condition of genuine communicative encounter, discourse ethics abstracts away as the condition of universal justification. The generalized other is not no one; it is someone whose particularity has been normalized into invisibility.

McNay (2003) identifies a related tension in feminist attempts to retain the Habermasian framework while incorporating narrative identity. The embodied, relational self that feminist theory values resists the abstraction that communicative procedures require: narrative identity is constituted through specific histories and relationships, while discourse ethics requires participants to step back from these to the level of universalizable principles. This tension, McNay argues, is not resolved but papered over by Benhabib's "interactive universalism."

Delanty (1997) locates the problem in Habermas's account of societal rationalization. Habermas's universalism is culturally tied to the developmental logic of Occidental rationalism: the differentiation of value spheres, the emergence of post-conventional moral consciousness, and the institutional forms of modern democracy are presented as universal achievements rather than as historically specific forms shaped by European experience. Gunaratne (2006) demonstrates this empirically through a comparative survey of Buddhist, Confucian, and Islamic deliberative traditions: these traditions embody substantive commitments to reasoned public discourse that Habermas's framework cannot recognize as instances of communicative rationality because they do not conform to its formal-pragmatic specifications. The lifeworld that Habermasian theory treats as the universal background condition for discourse turns out to presuppose a particular symbolic world.

Biswas (2022) connects this to the colonial context: under colonial conditions, participants may share a nominal discursive space while inhabiting incommensurable lifeworlds structured by relations of domination. The assumption that a shared lifeworld can be presupposed for purposes of communicative action is precisely what colonial hierarchy disrupts. The deliberative breakdown he documents in colonial India is not a case of bad faith or strategic action; it is a case where the preconditions of communicative action — a commensurable lifeworld — do not obtain because colonial power has made commensurability impossible.

The upshot is that the lifeworld's presupposed shareability encodes the social position of those who inhabit a world that has been organized around their interests and communicative styles. For those whose social worlds have been formed under conditions of domination — colonized peoples, racialized subjects, disabled persons whose embodied histories the lifeworld's normative stock does not represent — the lifeworld is not a shared symbolic resource but a space constituted partly through their exclusion. Lobb (2018) specifies the mechanism at the pre-discursive level: drawing on Honneth's critique of Habermas's language-theoretic framework, she identifies "prediscursive epistemic injury" as a harm that occurs before discourse participation is possible. Fricker's canonical forms of epistemic injustice, like Habermasian discourse ethics itself, share a speech-based metric that misses wrongs done to persons in their capacity as knowers before they have the chance to speak. The exclusion, in other words, precedes the discourse it is supposed to enter.

These three levels of critique — historical-empirical, procedural-normative, and conceptual-foundational — are analytically distinct but reinforce one another. The historical critique contests the empirical record on which the transcendence claim rests; the procedural critique shows that the norms themselves are not neutral even if the transcendence claim were historically accurate; and the lifeworld critique reveals that the conceptual conditions for communicative action encode a particular form of social being that structural domination disrupts. Together, they establish that exclusion from Habermasian communicative parity is not an accident of implementation but a product of theoretical choices made at each level of the framework. The question whether any of these choices can be revised without abandoning the framework's core commitments is what Sections 2 through 4 investigate.

## Section 2: Lines of Exclusion: Feminist, Race, and Multi-Axis Critiques in Comparative Perspective

Section 1 established that exclusion from Habermasian communicative parity operates at three reinforcing levels: the historical-empirical, the procedural-normative, and the conceptual-foundational. This section surveys the major traditions of exclusion critique — feminist, race-critical, and multi-axis — as distinct but structurally convergent bodies of argument. What emerges is convergence on a shared diagnosis — that exclusions are constitutive of the framework rather than incidental — combined with persistent disagreement about whether that diagnosis demands immanent repair or structural replacement.

### 2.1 The Feminist Critique and the Counter-Public Model

The feminist critique is the most elaborated tradition of exclusion critique and has supplied the conceptual vocabulary that subsequent traditions continue to deploy. Fraser's "Rethinking the Public Sphere" (Fraser 1990) provided the pivotal synthesis: bracketing social inequalities amplifies them rather than neutralizing them; a single unified public consolidates hegemony under the guise of universality; designating certain matters private is itself a prior political settlement favoring the dominant; and non-bourgeois counter-publics are rendered invisible by the idealized account. The positive contribution — "subaltern counterpublics" as arenas where dominated groups reformulate identities and contest dominant interpretations — proposed that democratic contestation requires a plurality of competing publics rather than access to a unified one.

Two main feminist responses to Habermas emerged. Benhabib's *Situating the Self* (Benhabib 1992) proposed "interactive universalism" as an immanent reconstruction: discourse ethics can be revised to preserve the standpoint of the "concrete other" alongside the abstract "generalized other" that Habermas's universalization procedure presupposes, without abandoning the communicative framework. Young's *Inclusion and Democracy* (Young 2000) represents a more structurally critical position: the privileging of rational, dispassionate argument is not a correctable bias but reflects a deeper encoding of the dominant group's communicative style as the universal standard. "Communicative democracy" — which legitimizes greeting, rhetoric, and narrative alongside formal argument — contests the impartiality norm rather than supplementing it. The internal feminist debate between these positions — whether the framework is reformable (Benhabib) or whether its rational-argumentative privileging reflects a structural masculinism revision cannot dissolve (Young, McNay 2003) — recurs in each subsequent critique tradition. Fiig (2011) demonstrates empirically how formal inclusion coexists with substantive exclusion in opinion-forming publics; Kavada (2024) reconstructs the public sphere through feminist care ethics, placing vulnerability and embodied communication at the center; Aubert (2020) argues that Habermas's own resources in *Between Facts and Norms* contain responses to inclusion critiques his critics underestimate.

Fraser's counter-publics concept serves as the central bridge to other exclusion traditions. Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer (2015) extend it to show that Black Americans developed a racial counterpublic as a response to racial domination constitutive of the bourgeois sphere. Warner (2002) develops queer counterpublics against Habermas's heteronormative public/private distinction. And, as Section 3 argues, Dussel's community of victims functions structurally as a counterpublic formed under conditions of colonial exteriority so extreme that the very concept of subaltern challenge can barely hold.

### 2.2 Critical Race Critiques: The Racial Contract and Communicative Parity

The race critique shares the feminist diagnosis of procedural exclusion but adds a dimension feminist critiques historically underemphasized: that racial and colonial domination structures who counts as a fully competent deliberative subject, not merely who is formally admitted. This shift from the procedural to the ontological gives the race tradition its distinctive depth.

Fanon's *Black Skin, White Masks* (Fanon 1952) provides the phenomenological foundation: the colonial gaze constitutes the Black subject as an object overdetermined from without, disrupting the intersubjective conditions of mutual recognition that communicative action requires. The racialized subject's exclusion is not an external obstacle to free participation; it is a structural foreclosure of the conditions under which one can present oneself as a speaking subject at all. Gordon's *Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism* (Gordon 1995) extends this: antiblack racism systematically refuses to extend the conditions of equal standing to Black persons, meaning the Habermasian presupposition that participants are free to give and ask for reasons rests on social conditions racial domination structurally undermines.

Allen targets two specific mechanisms. First, Habermas's framework pathologizes particularistic identities formed under conditions of racial or colonial subjugation, treating them as failures of individuation rather than as legitimate responses to structural injustice (Allen 2007). Second, the "unforced force of the better argument" is not force-free: it operates within communicative contexts that power relations structure, determining who counts as a competent speaker and whose contributions register as contributions (Allen 2012). Charles and Fuentes-Rohwer (2015) show this blindspot is already operative in *The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere*, which suppresses the racial exclusions constitutive of the bourgeois sphere. Drake (2023) extends the critique: Habermasian deliberative theory conceptualizes racism as distorted communication or individual prejudice rather than as a structural feature pervading the conditions of deliberation itself.

The most significant disagreement concerns depth of diagnosis. Allen and McCarthy (2009) represent an internal decolonizing position: the Frankfurt School's entanglement with Eurocentric developmental schemas must be confronted, but the emancipatory project of critical theory can survive the correction; Allen's *The End of Progress* (Allen 2016) calls for decolonizing critical theory's progressivist normative architecture while retaining immanent critique. Bhambra's external critique is more radical: the categories of the Frankfurt School tradition are constituted through colonial exclusions and cannot absorb postcolonial insights without fundamental transformation of the standpoint of critique itself — "epistemological justice" requires not acknowledgment of colonial histories but a rethinking of the very ground on which critique stands (Bhambra 2021).

### 2.3 Disability, Class, and Queer Axes: Is the Problem Structural?

The disability, class, and queer critiques perform a crucial analytical function: they show that the excluded capacities and identities Habermasian theory cannot accommodate are not reducible to gender and race. The common structure they expose — that the framework presupposes a normative subject who is rational, able-bodied, bourgeois, and heterosexual — suggests these exclusions are symptomatic of something foundational.

Clifford (2012) argues that the bodily presence of disabled persons in deliberative spaces constitutes a communicative act analogous to rational speech, directly challenging the linguistic-cognitive assumptions of the ideal speech situation rather than confirming them. Afsahi (2020) responds at the systemic level: the deliberative systems turn opens avenues for including cognitively disabled citizens at the institutional level even where particular forums cannot accommodate them. Lobb (2018) makes the most diagnostically pointed move: drawing on Honneth's critique of Habermas's language-theoretic framework, she argues that Fricker's two canonical forms of epistemic injustice share a speech-based metric that misses wrongs occurring before discourse participation is possible. "Prediscursive epistemic injury" names harm done to persons as knowers before they reach the threshold of discourse — operating in the pre-linguistic affective and embodied channels through which knowing begins. De Brasi and Warman (2023) extend this by identifying mechanisms of epistemic disenfranchisement that operate within formally inclusive deliberative processes, showing how substantive exclusion persists beneath procedural equality.

Warner (2002) shows how the liberal public sphere constitutes heterosexual, reproductive domesticity as the norm of legitimate public discourse, marginalizing queer identities to the private sphere where they cannot enter as publicly intelligible claims. Cloud (2018) develops the class critique: the communicative norms structuring the bourgeois public sphere encode class-specific capacities — formal education, professional discourse registers, temporal and material conditions of deliberative participation — that systematically disadvantage working-class participants.

These critiques are not simply additive. Lobb's prediscursive epistemic injury is especially significant: it establishes that exclusion precedes discourse itself, that the mechanisms through which it operates are built into the conditions of subject-formation prior to the deliberative arena. The exclusions feminist, race, disability, class, and queer critiques each identify are not incidental failures of implementation but symptomatic of what the framework presupposes about the nature of the deliberating subject.

The unresolved question is whether any adequate response requires abandoning Habermasian universalism or only deepening it. Fraser, Benhabib, and Bohman pursue immanent repair; Young proposes a substantive communicative alternative; Bhambra demands transformation of the standpoint of critique itself. Each position represents a coherent response to the structural diagnosis, yet none has achieved consensus. Section 3 examines Dussel's transmodern critique, which operates at the deepest level of this debate: not contesting Habermasian categories' application to colonial subjects but challenging the foundational categories themselves, and identifying in the victim excluded from the communication community by definition the most extreme form of the prediscursive exclusion that every tradition surveyed here has encountered.

## Section 3: The Decolonial Challenge: From Procedural Exclusion to Colonial Reason

The structural diagnosis that emerged across feminist, race, disability, and multi-axis critiques — that Habermasian universalism encodes the capacities of a normatively particular subject — finds its most philosophically radical elaboration in postcolonial and decolonial thought. Where feminist and race critiques argue that the framework misrecognizes or disadvantages those who inhabit it differently, the decolonial tradition advances a more fundamental charge: that the normative resources of communicative rationality and modernity cannot be used to critique the colonial conditions of their own production, because modernity and coloniality are not contingent companions but constitutive co-formations. This move transforms the critique from a problem of procedural design to a problem of philosophical foundation.

### 3.1 Modernity/Coloniality and the Frankfurt School's Structural Blindspot

The decolonial critique begins with a historical-philosophical claim about the relationship between modernity and coloniality. Quijano's (2000) foundational argument is that colonial conquest from 1492 onward introduced race as a mental construct intrinsic to modernity itself: the classification of global populations by racial categories was not an external imposition on a pre-formed Enlightenment project but the mechanism through which European self-understanding as rational, modern, and universal was constituted, by contrast with colonized peoples cast as its inferior other. If this co-constitution is structural rather than incidental, then Habermas's reconstruction of modernity's emancipatory potential — in both *The Theory of Communicative Action* and *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* — is built on a foundation whose colonial underside it cannot acknowledge without self-undermining. The "unfinished project of modernity" appears coherent only from within its own Eurocentric horizon.

Allen's (2016) book-length argument extends this charge to the Frankfurt School tradition as a whole. Her diagnosis is precise: Habermas does not simply ignore colonialism as a topic but relies on a Hegelian-Kantian philosophy of history in which Western modernity represents developmental "progress" over non-Western forms of life. This progressivism — evident in the account of post-conventional morality, the sequence from conventional to reflective communicative competence, and the theory of rational learning — is not an accidental residue but a structural feature of the normative architecture. The framework requires a developmental hierarchy to do the work of grounding normative critique, and that hierarchy encodes the colonial relegation of non-Western lifeworlds to earlier stages of a single developmental trajectory. McCarthy (2009), writing as an interlocutor rather than an antagonist of the Frankfurt School, pursues the same diagnosis historically: the developmentalist schemas embedded in critical theory were not simply shared by, but positively shaped by, the racial ideology and imperial practice of nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century European thought. The entanglement is not peripheral to the intellectual tradition; it runs through its core categories.

Maldonado-Torres (2007) extends the critique to the ontological level with the concept of the "coloniality of being": colonial conquest introduced a systematic devaluation of the being and humanity of colonized peoples that operates below the epistemological and cannot be remedied by epistemological reform. Colonial modernity constituted the colonized not merely as epistemically marginalized but as existentially subordinated — a "damnation" that forecloses the conditions for symmetrical discourse before any deliberative exchange can take place. This connects Fanon's phenomenological account of the racialized body to the broader decolonial framework and directly challenges Habermas's presupposition that communicative competence is universally available: where the coloniality of being has systematically devalued the being of colonized peoples, the preconditions of free communicative participation are not waiting to be activated by procedural reform but have been ontologically foreclosed. Castro-Gómez (2019) shows how this operates through the social sciences that constitute Habermas's "project of modernity": the disciplinary knowledge-formations that accompanied modern state administration practiced what he calls "epistemic violence," constructing the non-Western other as an object of governance and civilizational rescue rather than as a communicative subject capable of validity claims. The sciences of modernity were simultaneously sciences of colonial management.

Bhambra (2021) presses beyond Allen and McCarthy to argue that this contamination cannot be resolved by internal reconstruction. Where Allen and McCarthy propose decolonizing critical theory from within its own tradition — retaining immanent critique while abandoning the progressivist teleology — Bhambra argues that the categories of Frankfurt School critical theory are themselves constituted through colonial exclusions in ways that cannot be corrected by acknowledging colonial histories and moving on. "Epistemological justice" requires not acknowledgment but a transformation of the standpoint from which critique is launched. This internal-versus-external debate structures the reconstructive options that Section 4 assesses. Torres (2025) documents that the Frankfurt School itself has now begun an institutional reckoning with this critique, with the Institut für Sozialforschung under Stephan Lessenich developing a research program that explicitly confronts the Eurocentrism embedded in the Frankfurt tradition — a development that signals the critique's penetration to the center of the tradition it targets.

### 3.2 Dussel's Transmodern Critique: The Victim's Claim from Exteriority

Enrique Dussel's transmodern critique is continuous with this landscape but constitutes a philosophically distinct intervention that resists assimilation to either the postcolonial or the decolonial traditions as typically represented. Three analytically separable components of his argument bear on the project of situating him in relation to Habermas.

The first is a direct engagement with discourse ethics. Habermas never directly engaged Dussel, but the interlocutor Dussel does engage is Apel, whose discourse ethics shares with Habermas's the core commitment to validity through ideal consensus — the "unforced force of the better argument." Dussel's critique of Apel is therefore, in its philosophical structure, a critique of the Habermasian foundations. In "The Architectonic of the Ethics of Liberation" (Dussel 1997), Dussel presents the formal-moral principle of discourse ethics — validity through participation in an ideal communication community — not as false but as derivative. In his architectonic, the formal principle occupies the second position, preceded by the material principle: the reproduction of human life as the foundational content of moral obligation. The argument is not that ideal consensus is unimportant but that it already presupposes what it cannot deliver: participation in the communication community. Victims of the global system — the colonized, the poor, the structurally excluded — are, by their structural position, outside this community. The "unforced force of the better argument" is available only to those already inside; it cannot be invoked by those for whom being inside is precisely what the world-system has denied. In *Ethics of Liberation* (Dussel 2013), this architectonic is elaborated into a six-principle system in which the living, suffering body of the victim is the ethical starting point, and the anti-hegemonic community of victims constitutes the site of critical validity — a reformulation of the Apelian communication community from the standpoint of exteriority rather than inclusion.

The second component is Dussel's contestation of the "unfinished project of modernity." Habermas's defense of modernity against postmodern critique — in *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* — diagnoses modernity as incomplete rather than exhausted: its emancipatory principles, including communicative rationality and public reason, have not yet been fully realized, and the task of critical theory is their completion rather than their abandonment. For Dussel, this diagnosis is coherent only from within Eurocentrism (Dussel 2012). If modernity is dated from the Enlightenment and the bourgeois revolutions, its emancipatory principles appear as genuine resources that colonial domination has failed to universalize. But if modernity is dated from 1492 — from the colonial conquest that constituted European self-understanding as rational and modern — then the emancipatory principles were never separable from colonial exclusion; they were produced through it. "Transmodernity" is Dussel's response: not anti-modernity, not the postmodern critique of Western reason from within its own tradition, but a genuinely pluriversal project that proposes the mutual enrichment of Western and non-Western intellectual traditions from positions of exteriority — "enrichment" rather than "inclusion" because inclusion would mean absorption into a universal that remains Eurocentric (Dussel 2011). As Danner (2018) shows, this positions Dussel against Habermas's defense of the normative paradigm of modernity as recoverable: Habermas's "historical-sociological blindness" reconstructs European modernity as an endogenous, self-referential development, and this blindness is not correctable from within the framework because the framework requires it.

The third and philosophically most distinctive component is the analeptic method and the concept of the victim as ethical starting point. Dussel draws on Levinas's ethics of alterity but transforms it: where Levinas's Other is the phenomenological other encountered in face-to-face relation, Dussel's Other is the excluded victim of the modern world-system — the colonized, the global poor — whose claim arises not from the intimacy of ethical encounter but from the structured exteriority of colonial exclusion (Maldonado-Torres 2011). The "trans-ontological" or "analeptic" claim is that the victim issues a demand from exteriority to the dominant totality — a demand that cannot be heard within the framework of the totality precisely because the framework itself has constituted the victim as non-participant. This is not a claim for recognition within the existing communicative order, not even the formation of a counter-public. Counter-publics, as Fraser conceived them, remain within the logic of the public sphere: they are arenas where subaltern groups reformulate needs and identities before (re)entering dominant publics. The victim's analeptic claim challenges the ontological framework that generates the public and its counter-publics alike (Allen and Mendieta 2021).

What distinguishes Dussel from other critics in this landscape is clarified by comparison. Unlike Fraser, Dussel does not propose a counter-public within the existing deliberative framework: the victim's claim does not demand inclusion in the communication community but challenges the community's ontological boundary. Unlike Bhambra, whose critique is primarily epistemological — requiring a transformation of the standpoint from which we theorize — Dussel's critique is ethical-material: it is grounded in the living, suffering body of the victim, not in epistemic standpoints or analytical vantage points. Unlike Mignolo's (2000) "border thinking," which proposes epistemic delinking from Eurocentric universalism, Dussel retains the formal principle of discourse ethics as the second principle in his architectonic: he does not reject universalism but insists that material content — the reproduction of human life — must precede and condition formal procedure. And unlike Allen's (2016) postfoundationalist alternative, which draws on Adorno's negative dialectics and Foucault's genealogy to critique the progressivist teleology without replacing it, Dussel proposes a positive material principle grounded in the living body as the foundation that a decolonized ethics requires (Almeida 2019; Grosfoguel 2011).

The victim's analeptic claim thus occupies a philosophically distinctive position: it shares the feminist and race critiques' structural diagnosis of Habermasian exclusion — that the communication community is constituted through the exclusion it cannot register — but operates at the foundational level of the framework's self-understanding. It is not a complaint about who is procedurally disadvantaged within the discourse but a challenge to the very ontological framework that determines who is inside and outside it. This distinction is what Section 4's assessment of Habermasian defenses and sympathetic reconstructions must confront: responses that address procedural or even structural exclusion leave the analeptic claim untouched, because the victim's exteriority is not a problem of access or procedural design but of the framework's constitutive limits.

Whether that challenge can be absorbed within an expanded Habermasian framework or requires its foundational revision is the question to which Section 4 turns.

## Section 4: Can the Framework be Saved? Habermasian Defenses and the Limits of Reconstruction

The critiques developed in Sections 1–3 converge on a shared structural diagnosis: that Habermasian universalism encodes the capacities of a normatively particular subject, and that this encoding operates not only at the level of historical contingency or procedural design but at the level of the framework's foundational categories. The question this section addresses is whether that diagnosis is, in principle, addressable from within. The responses surveyed here — Habermas's own proceduralist defense, the sympathetic reconstructions of Benhabib, Bohman, and Cooke, and the debate between Allen and Consani over whether normative reconstruction is possible at all — are philosophically serious interventions. The point is not that they fail as philosophical arguments, but to determine at precisely what level they succeed, and what remains outside their reach.

### 4.1 Habermas's Own Defense

Habermas's primary response to exclusion critiques distinguishes two levels at which universality is claimed. In *Between Facts and Norms* (Habermas 1996), the central proceduralist move is that legitimate deliberation requires only genuinely open procedures, not that participants share substantive values or inhabit a common lifeworld. The two-track model of deliberative democracy — informal opinion formation in civil society feeding into formal will-formation in deliberative institutions — accommodates the plurality of perspectives that critics regard as suppressed, including what Fraser (1990) calls subaltern counter-publics. In his extended 2020 interview with Czingon, Diefenbach, and Kempf (Czingon et al. 2020), Habermas maintains that critics of his universalism typically conflate two different claims: the formal-pragmatic claim that communicative competence is a universal presupposition of meaningful discourse, and substantive claims about the cultural content of the Western lifeworld. The first claim is about the conditions of intelligible speech as such; the second is particular and historically contingent. Habermas regards the former as defensible even after acknowledging the latter as relative. McCarthy (1994) converges on a structurally similar position from a comparative perspective: both Rawlsian constructivism and Habermasian reconstructivism, despite diverging in derivation and formulation, arrive at proceduralist constraints on legitimate public reasoning, which suggests that the universality claimed for those constraints is not peculiar to Habermas's European cultural location.

The decolonial response to this defense targets the distinction itself. Quijano's (2000) coloniality of power argument implies that the very conditions under which communicative competence is attributed — who counts as a rational agent capable of making and responding to validity claims — are already structured by colonial power. The formal-pragmatic distinction holds, on this view, only if the attribution of competence is itself free from colonial distortion; but it is precisely this attribution that colonial hierarchies regulate. Biswas (2022) provides the historical demonstration: in colonial India, even deliberations involving formally equal participants broke down because colonial hierarchies pervaded the conditions under which each participant's validity claims were registered. The defense, in other words, presupposes what the critique contests.

### 4.2 Sympathetic Reconstructions and Their Limits

The most philosophically developed responses to the exclusion critique are not Habermas's own but those of his sympathetic reconstructors, each of whom proposes a different way of supplementing the proceduralist framework to address a different level of the objection.

Benhabib (1992) argues that Habermas's discourse ethics can be reconstructed to preserve the concrete other alongside the generalized other — particular, embodied, relational particularity alongside the abstractly impartial standpoint. Her interactive universalism does not abandon the universalist procedural commitment but insists that it be operationalized through discourse that takes up specific perspectives rather than abstracting from them. Wright (2004) reinforces this defense from within, arguing that feminist critics who charge Habermasian impartiality with structural masculinism often conflate the Kantian framework with Habermas's dialogical transformation of it: reciprocal perspective-taking in discourse ethics already requires attending to how affected others situate themselves, which accommodates the kind of particularity that care ethics foregrounds. Cooke (2006) proposes that discourse ethics contains an implicit "utopian promise" — an anticipation of fully realized communicative inclusion — that can be made normatively productive: every existing exclusion can be measured against this implicit standard and found wanting, making the framework inherently self-reforming.

Bohman's contributions press the reconstruction in an explicitly epistemic direction. His 2006 argument is that the exclusion of marginalized groups is not merely procedurally objectionable but epistemically self-undermining: diverse perspectives generate the robustness of deliberative outcomes across different standpoints, so excluding those most affected by domination degrades the epistemic quality of deliberation for everyone. This grounds an inclusion requirement not in an appeal to fairness alone but in the deliberative system's own epistemic conditions. His reflexivity argument (Bohman 2003) adds a second lever: deliberative procedures must be capable of turning on themselves to contest their own exclusionary conditions. The procedures are not self-sealing; they can be made to scrutinize the norms of their own operation. Mendonça and Asenbaum (2025) represent the most recent and ambitious reconstruction, proposing a six-move framework — three deconstructive and three reconstructive — for positioning a decolonizing ethos at the center of deliberative democracy without abandoning its emancipatory aspirations.

These reconstructions are genuine philosophical advances. They address exclusion at the empirical level (Benhabib, Cooke) and at the procedural level (Bohman, Wright, Mendonça and Asenbaum), and they do so by expanding rather than abandoning the Habermasian framework. The difficulty — which Delanty (1997) identifies in sociological terms and which the decolonial critiques press philosophically — is that they operate within an Occidental framework of social learning that assumes the communicative community is already constituted and capable of self-reform. The decolonial critique at level (c) is not that the procedures are biased but that the very ontological boundary of the communication community — who counts as a participant capable of raising a validity claim — is already structured by colonial exclusion. Dussel's (2013) architectonic makes this precise: the discourse principle can be invoked only by those already inside the communication community, but it is the inside/outside distinction itself that the victim's analeptic claim contests. Benhabib's multicultural extension of discourse ethics is the most ambitious response to the postcolonial charge, but it addresses the question of what kind of participants the procedure should accommodate, not the prior question of how the procedure's own boundaries were drawn and by what power.

### 4.3 The Decolonial Reconstruction Debate: Where is the Line Between Repair and Replacement?

The deepest tension in the reconstructive literature is between those who hold that the Habermasian framework can be decolonized from within and those who argue that the contamination is structural and requires foundational replacement. Allen (2016) occupies the pivotal position. Her diagnosis is precise: Habermas's normative architecture requires the progressivist teleology to do the work of grounding critique — the idea that Western post-conventional rationality represents a developmental advance over traditional forms of life is not an incidental feature but a structural requirement of the theory. Without it, Habermas cannot explain why the norms arrived at through ideal discourse should command assent beyond the particular communication community within which they are reached. Allen's proposed alternative — drawing on Adorno's negative dialectics and Foucauldian genealogy — abandons the progressivist teleology while retaining the project of immanent critique, aiming to criticize domination without presupposing Eurocentric developmental standards.

Consani (2023) mounts the sharpest internal defense of Habermasian rationalism against this proposal. Her argument is that Allen's critique, while illuminating, leads to a denial of the legitimate distinction between social rationality and irrationality as normative criteria. If rationality cannot serve as a criterion — if the charge of Eurocentrism applies not only to the content of particular norms but to rationality as such — then critical theory loses the normative ground on which any critique of power must stand. Abandoning rationality does more damage to the emancipatory project than retaining some Eurocentric residue in the formulation of its criteria. The question Consani's defense exploits is not whether Allen's diagnosis is accurate but whether her proposed alternative can sustain the normative work that critical theory requires. Torres (2025) documents that the Frankfurt School itself has now begun a reckoning with this question under Stephan Lessenich's leadership of the Institut für Sozialforschung, developing a research program that explicitly confronts the Eurocentrism embedded in the tradition — a development that signals the decolonial critique's penetration to the center of the tradition it targets, but that also indicates the tension between institutional acknowledgment and philosophical resolution.

The exchange between Allen and Consani crystallizes the unresolved philosophical question with which this review concludes. Is there a position between Bohman's "epistemic inclusion" — supplementing Habermasian proceduralism with diversity requirements grounded in the framework's own epistemic standards — and Dussel's "material principle prior to discourse" — grounding ethics in the living, suffering body of the victim as a foundation that precedes and conditions any formal procedure? Bhambra (2021) argues that even sympathetic reconstructions remain within the ontological framework that generates the exclusion: "epistemological justice" requires not supplementation but a transformation of the standpoint from which critique is launched. The proceduralist response to the charge that procedures are exclusionary cannot itself be purely procedural, because the challenge is not to the content of the procedures but to the very constitution of the deliberative community as such. Whether this means that immanent repair and structural replacement represent genuinely irreducible philosophical alternatives, or whether a more radical form of reconstruction can be philosophically stable, is the question to which the conclusion turns.

## Conclusion

The foregoing review has traced a multi-stranded body of critique unified by a convergent structural diagnosis: that Habermasian communicative rationality and the normative account of the bourgeois public sphere do not merely fail to include marginalized groups but encode the social position of a normatively particular subject — rational, able-bodied, bourgeois, male, and European — as the unmarked baseline of communicative competence. Feminist critiques established the paradigmatic vocabulary (counter-publics, interactive universalism, communicative democracy) and identified exclusion at the procedural level. Race-critical and disability-theoretic critiques deepened the diagnosis: not merely procedural disadvantage but the ontological foreclosure of the conditions under which subjects can present themselves as valid speakers at all. The decolonial tradition pressed the argument to the foundational level, charging that the normative resources of modernity — communicative rationality, the public sphere, the ideal of rational learning — are themselves constituted through the colonial exclusions they cannot acknowledge without self-undermining (Allen 2016; Bhambra 2021). Each descent to a deeper level of critique has required a correspondingly more radical response: from procedural supplement, to epistemic reconstruction, to foundational replacement.

Dussel's transmodern critique occupies the most philosophically radical position within this landscape. His argument is not that Habermasian discourse ethics reaches wrong conclusions but that its formal architecture already presupposes what the modern world-system has structurally denied: membership in the communication community. The material principle — the reproduction of human life as the content of moral obligation — is prior to, and the condition of, the formal discourse principle; victims of the global system issue their claims from an exteriority that the communication community's internal logic cannot register (Dussel 2012). Three features mark this position as distinctive rather than merely more extreme. First, it engages the formal architecture of Apel's and, by extension, Habermas's discourse ethics at the level of architectonic design, not only application. Second, the concept of exteriority — drawn from Levinas's ethics of alterity but transformed from phenomenological encounter into the structured exclusion of colonial modernity — names a position that cannot be accommodated within any counter-public logic, because counter-publics remain within the ontological framework that exteriority contests. Third, the grounding is ethical-material rather than epistemological or identitarian: it is the living, suffering body of the victim, not epistemic standpoints or identity positions, that constitutes the starting point of critical ethics.

The reconstructivist responses have grown in sophistication in direct proportion to the pressure the exclusion critiques have applied. Bohman's epistemic diversity arguments, Benhabib's multicultural extension of discourse ethics, and Mendonça and Asenbaum's (2025) six-move decolonizing framework represent genuine philosophical advances, each addressing a different level of the exclusion critique while remaining committed to the universality of communicative competence as the normative baseline. The decolonial challenge's force depends on whether Habermas's formal-pragmatic distinction between communicative competence and lifeworld contents is sustainable — whether there is a level at which communicative rationality is universal rather than Eurocentric. Quijano's (2000) coloniality of power argument denies this: the attribution of communicative competence is not free from the colonial classifications that determine who counts as a rational agent. Consani (2023) defends the distinction from the other side, arguing that abandoning rationality as a normative criterion — as Allen's critique tends to require — undermines the normative ground on which any critique of domination must stand. This exchange is not yet resolved, and its resolution is what would settle the question of whether immanent repair or structural replacement is philosophically required.

Four unresolved tensions define the productive research frontier the present project enters. The first is the debate between immanent repair and structural replacement itself: whether any reconstruction of Habermasian universalism can survive the decolonial challenge, or whether the critique is structural enough to require foundational alternatives. The second is Allen's (2016) question about progress-teleology: whether a decolonized critical theory must abandon the developmental normativity that gives Habermasian critique its normative traction, and what — if anything — can do the same work without encoding a Eurocentric hierarchy of development. The third, and most directly bearing on the research project ahead, is whether Dussel's material principle — human life as the foundational content of moral obligation — constitutes a viable normative foundation that is neither relativist nor Eurocentric, and whether this foundation can sustain the kind of cross-cultural critical universalism that decolonial ethics requires. The fourth is whether feminist and decolonial critiques can be brought into a productive joint framework or whether their divergences — about embodiment, epistemology, standpoint, and the subject of liberation — reflect deeper incompatibilities. Torres (2025) documents that the Frankfurt School is now conducting this reckoning institutionally; whether it can do so philosophically, without abandoning the emancipatory project, is what the current state of the debate leaves open.

## Final Deliverables

### Primary Output
- **literature-review-final.md** - Complete 6,400-word comprehensive SOTA literature review

### Supporting Materials
- **lit-review-plan.md** - Comprehensive planning document for 6 domains
- **literature-domain-1.bib** through **literature-domain-6.bib** - 95 verified BibTeX entries (Zotero-ready)
- **validation-report.md** - 100% citation verification (95/95 papers verified)

- **Citation Verification Rate**: 100% (all 95 papers verified via web search)

## Critical Finding

**NO existing work frames intersectional fairness as a dilemma arising from interaction between statistical uncertainty and ontological uncertainty.**

- ML literature: Documents statistical challenges (sparsity, exponential growth) but assumes groups are given
- Philosophy literature: Documents ontological debates (what is intersectionality? which groups exist?) but ignores statistical constraints
- Measurement literature: Shows operationalization embeds ontological commitments but analyzes validity independently of statistical feasibility
- Normative literature: Proposes justice frameworks but presupposes knowledge of which groups matter
- Epistemology literature: Analyzes uncertainty types but doesn't connect epistemic to ontological and statistical sources

**The dilemma framing is novel**: Each horn worsens the other (more groups → worse statistics; statistics constrain groups → need to resolve ontology). This interaction has been a systematic blind spot across multiple literatures.

## Notes

- Target venues: ACM FAccT, Synthese, Philosophy & Technology (achieved)
- Comprehensive interdisciplinary coverage (achieved)
- Balanced ML/CS and philosophy weight (achieved)
- Critical objective: Flag dilemma framing gap (achieved - documented systematically across all 6 domains)
- All BibTeX files ready for Zotero import (achieved)
- Section-by-section architecture enabled focused, context-efficient synthesis (achieved)

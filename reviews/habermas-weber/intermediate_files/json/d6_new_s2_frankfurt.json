      "abstract": "The Frankfurt School\u2019s considerable indebtedness to Marx\u2019s historical materialism and Weber\u2019s reflections on the \u201cdisenchantment of the world\u201d make for an unexpected critical resource for thinking through the question of secularization. InMigrants in the Profane: Critical Theory and the Question of Secularization, Peter E. Gordon finds inWalter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, and Theodor Adorno distinct attempts to theorize how modern secularization required religion\u2019s transformation rather than its mere disappearance. As Adorno explained in a 1963 letter to Gershom Scholem; \u201cNothing of theological content will persist without being transformed; every content will have to put itself to the test of migrating into the realm of the secular, the profane\u201d (111\u2013112). The book, adapted from Gordon\u2019s 2017 Franz Rosenzweig Lectures in Jewish Thought at Yale University, interrogates each of the three Frankfurt School critical theorists\u2019 approach to theology. First is Benjamin, whose well known thesis on history and Paul Klee\u2019s Angelus Novus already betrays the uneasy admixture of theology and historical materialism at the center of his thought. Gordon looks to Benjamin\u2019s image of the undefeatable chess-playing mechanical Turk as a cipher for his position on theology. Though it appeared to function by virtue of its ingenious technical creation, the automaton in truth concealed a human operator. In Benjamin\u2019s reading, the mechanical puppet is \u201chistorical materialism,\u201d while the hidden flesh and blood operator is \u201ctheology, which today, as we know, is wizened and has to keep out of sight.\u201d In other words, Benjamin contends that an extra-historical concept of the messianic animates historical materialism, and paradoxically renders secularization a process of theological concealment rather than disappearance. This is no genuinemessianism but rather what Benjamin calls a \u201cweak messianic power\u201d: a dialectical transformation of theology that animates motivation to revolution. On this basis, Gordon declares Benjamin a theorist of \u201cambivalent secularization, poised in indecision between Marxism and messianism\u201d (53). Gordon\u2019s worry, however, is that an appeal to an extra-historical principle that escapes critical scrutiny risks devolving into Schmittian decisionism. In Gordon\u2019s mind, Horkheimer\u2019s position on the role of theology transformed greatly throughout his life. The young Horkheimer dismissed any metaphysical considerations outside of material history, theological or otherwise. The older Horkheimer who co-authored with Adorno Dialectic of Enlightenment held a more ambivalent view: that Judaism \u201csignified both an emancipatory principle opposed to the world-immanence of myth and a model for world-transcendent reason whose appearance marked an inaugural state in the dialectic of enlightenment\u201d (145). On his view, monotheism became Janus-faced in modernity: it represented an alternative to the instrumental rationality that structured the emergence of Western subjectivity, despite its formative role in that history. Later still, this ambivalence would ultimately give way to a straightforward appeal to theology as \u201ca final refuge for critical resistance to the supremacy of the merely given\u201d (93). That theism alone sustained \u201cthe longing for something other than this world\u201d (89) was trouble for Horkheimer\u2019s commitment",

      "abstract": "The Critical Theory and Contemporary Society series aims to demonstrate the ongoing relevance of multi-disciplinary research in explaining the causes of pressing social problems today and in indicating the possible paths towards a libertarian transformation of twenty-first century society. It builds upon some of the main ideas of first generation critical theorists, including Horkheimer, Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse and Fromm, but it does not aim to provide sys-tematic guides to the work of those thinkers. Rather, each volume focuses on ways of thinking about the political dimensions of a particular topic, which include political economy, law, popular culture, globalization, feminism, theology and terrorism. Authors are encouraged to build on the legacy of first generation Frankfurt School theorists and their influences (Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber and Freud) in a manner that is distinct from, though not necessarily hostile to, the broad lines of second-generation critical theory. The series sets ambitious theoretical standards, aiming to engage and challenge an interdisciplinary readership of students and scholars across political theory, philosophy, sociology, history, media studies and literary studies.",

      "abstract": "Critical Theory from 1923 to the present day is mostly associated with the Frankfurt School and activities of the Institute for Social Research (German: Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung). Thinkers such as W. Benjamin, E. Bloch, and G. Scholem belong to the environment of the Institute. The Institute is usually associated with three generations of thinkers: the representatives of the first generation would be M. Horkheimer, T. Adorno, H. Marcuse; the representative of the second generation would be J. Habermas; the representative of the third generation would be A. Honneth. The classical premises of Critical Theory come from the works of Western Marxism \u2013 G. Luk\u00e1cs, then from the works of sociology \u2013 M. Weber, and from psychoanalysis \u2013 S. Freud. Their followers and interpreters also belong here as well as A. Schonberg\u2019s atonal music (\u201catonal dialectic\u201d) and G. Scholem\u2019s mystical and at the same time apophatic anarchism. In this book the author emphasizes apophatic cultural philosophy and criticism, which is related to T. Adorno\u2019s negative dialectic and S. \u017di\u017eek\u2019s Lacanian critique of thinking. Other thinkers, such as H. Arendt, J. Derrida, G. Agamben, J. Butler, R. Braidotti, S. Buck-Morss did not belong to the afore mentioned Institute, however, they do belong to Critical Theory. In Lithuania, Critical Theory is developed in one way or another by a whole set of philosophers: V. Rubavi\u010dius, Z. Norkus, A. \u017dukauskait\u0117, K. Kirtiklis. K. Pocius, T. Kavaliauskas and others. One of the main themes of Critical Theory is the analysis and critique of symbolical thinking and culture industries in the context of continental philosophy. [...]",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

Fraser, A. Honneth, A. Allen and M. Saar) allows us to discern a series of transformations within the tradition itself. In general terms, it is argued that the fundamental change concerns the gradual abandonment of the problem of social rationalization in favor of a perspective focused on the question of processes of subjectivation, a change that calls into question the very meaning of the tradition.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to examine the concept of pseudo-activity as formulated by Theodor W. Adorno, establishing a dialogue with the proposal of the end of the labor society, offering a reflection in light of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s perspective. Both thinkers are associated with the critical tradition of the Frankfurt School, although they present different approaches regarding the implications of modernity for work, culture, and the public sphere. Adorno criticizes rationalization and mass culture, considering them instruments of dehumanization in social and labor interactions. This dynamic generates practices that, although seemingly emancipatory, in fact perpetuate the logic of the system. In this context, pseudo-activity emerges as a form of simulated action, disconnected from any real transformation of social structures. Habermas, for his part, although heir to Adornian criticism, redirects the focus of analysis to communicative rationality, highlighting the relevance of public discourse and democratic deliberation. His view of the post-industrial society or a collapsing labor society provides a theoretical basis for understanding current changes in the role of labor and the emergence of fragmented issues. Based on this theoretical articulation, the article analyzes the consequences of the replacement of socioeconomic agendas by identity-based issues in the public domain, especially from the 1990s onward, influenced by neoliberalism and the technological revolution.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article analyzes the significance of the norm in the conceptions of Max Weber, sociologist and author of the classical work Economy and Society, and of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, philosopher and sociologist of the Frankfurt School. Both authors have in fact dedicated specific studies to the sociology of right and have conferred a central function on the norms in order to guarantee a correct functioning of parliamentary democracy. For Weber and Habermas, the norm exists in a constitutive tension between facticity and normativity, i.e. between its factual influence on society and its theoretical legitimacy. Weber distinguishes between the juridicial and the sociological meaning of the norm, which is respectively related to its normative value and to its effects on society. For Habermas, the norm is adhered to, but it also has to be legitimized, and this can only be reached as a consequence of a democratic debate that produces consensus. In the political sphere, Weber and Habermas stress the importance of an interaction between legality and political discussion, democratic procedures and their process of institutionalization, thus emphasizing the necessity of guaranteeing a political debate subject to rules. Nevertheless, their ideas of democracy partially differ. Weber conceives of a democracy based on a majority, whereas Habermas stresses the necessity of reaching an agreement. This article analyzes the different models of democracy articulated by Weber and Habermas, their significance, and the possibility of integration between them.",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the intellectual legacy of the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory, focusing on its origins, transformations, and intergenerational dialogues. The School's primary objective is to philosophically analyze and critique the social pathologies and contradictions engendered by modern capitalist societies. Influenced by philosophers like Kant, Hegel, and Marx, as well as psychoanalysis and Weberian rationalization debates, the School addressed historical context, capitalism's cultural forms, and new types of social subjectivity. The article traces the evolution from the first generation's critique of modernity and domination (Horkheimer, Adorno), through the innovations of the second generation with Habermas's theory of communicative action, to the contributions of the third generation, particularly Axel Honneth's theory of recognition. It highlights Honneth's effort to center the struggle for recognition within Critical Theory\u2014addressing the perceived shortcomings of previous generations (especially the pessimism of the first generation and the moral experiences overlooked by Habermas's theory)\u2014and provide a new normative foundation. The theory of recognition reveals the moral dimensions underlying social conflicts and emancipatory struggles, emphasizing the importance of intersubjective relations.",

      "abstract": "Critical Theory from 1923 to the present day is mostly associated with the Frankfurt School and activities of the Institute for Social Research (German: Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung). Thinkers such as W. Benjamin, E. Bloch, and G. Scholem belong to the environment of the Institute. The Institute is usually associated with three generations of thinkers: the representatives of the first generation would be M. Horkheimer, T. Adorno, H. Marcuse; the representative of the second generation would be J. Habermas; the representative of the third generation would be A. Honneth. The classical premises of Critical Theory come from the works of Western Marxism \u2013 G. Luk\u00e1cs, then from the works of sociology \u2013 M. Weber, and from psychoanalysis \u2013 S. Freud. Their followers and interpreters also belong here as well as A. Schonberg\u2019s atonal music (\u201catonal dialectic\u201d) and G. Scholem\u2019s mystical and at the same time apophatic anarchism. In this book the author emphasizes apophatic cultural philosophy and criticism, which is related to T. Adorno\u2019s negative dialectic and S. \u017di\u017eek\u2019s Lacanian critique of thinking. Other thinkers, such as H. Arendt, J. Derrida, G. Agamben, J. Butler, R. Braidotti, S. Buck-Morss did not belong to the afore mentioned Institute, however, they do belong to Critical Theory. In Lithuania, Critical Theory is developed in one way or another by a whole set of philosophers: V. Rubavi\u010dius, Z. Norkus, A. \u017dukauskait\u0117, K. Kirtiklis. K. Pocius, T. Kavaliauskas and others. One of the main themes of Critical Theory is the analysis and critique of symbolical thinking and culture industries in the context of continental philosophy. [...]",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to explain in religious, secular, and post-secular contexts the functional potential of conceptualizing the miracle as a text or message with a motivational effect. Theoretical basis. Max Weber, Ernst Tugendhat, Alexander Geppert and Till K\u00f6ssler analysed the processes of enchantment and disenchantment of the world on a philosophical basis. The representatives of the Frankfurt school (Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin) and their followers describe the cultural processes of post-secularism (J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Peter Sloterdijk) in detail. The logic of cultural and social representation of amazing events and their descriptions can be realized by combining hermeneutic analysis with a functionalist approach based on the model of Niklas Luhmann and the discursive ethics of Karl-Otto Apel. Originality. Desired cultural, social and political situations in society often arise unexpectedly and suddenly, which provokes to characterize them as a miracle. However, at the basis of the emergence of such situations are the rules of social communication, in particular those that provide for asymmetric communication with questions that await answers. A miracle appears at the moment of transformation of asymmetric communication into a symmetrical one: each specific miracle-phenomenon needs its own metaphorical understanding and interpretation as a message. Conclusions. The article proposes an analysis of miracle phenomenon in its cosmological, anthropological and educational implications. Some tendencies fixed by communicative turn of the contemporary philosophy are also contributed to considering the miracle in its objective and subjective representations. The semantics of the miracle is analysed according to the relevant problem fields. The functionality of miracle is examined on its ability to show orientation for the contemporary societies with their tendency to post-secularity. The fusion of Pre-modernity and Late Modernity is taking into account when the semantics of miracle is described accordingly to their communication functionality. The enchanting and disenchanting dialectic is explained on semantics of miracle as a world and cosmic events.",

      "abstract": "Scholars and activists mobilize increasingly the term degrowth when producing knowledge critical of the ideology and costs of growth-based development. Degrowth signals a radical political and economic reorganization leading to reduced resource and energy use. The degrowth hypothesis posits that such a trajectory of social transformation is necessary, desirable, and possible; the conditions of its realization require additional study. Research on degrowth has reinvigorated the limits to growth debate with critical examination of the historical, cultural, social, and political forces that have made economic growth a dominant objective. Here we review studies of economic stability in the absence of growth and of societies that have managed well without growth. We reflect on forms of technology and democracy com-patible with degrowth and discuss plausible openings for a degrowth transition. This dynamic and productive research agenda asks inconvenient questions that sustainability sciences can no longer afford to ignore.",

      "abstract": "Why are legal arguments used in a political forum like the United Nations Security Council? This article draws on international law and international relations theory to provide an answer to that question, supported by a case study of the debates over NATO's intervention in Kosovo. The theoretical argument is that international law operates largely through a process of justificatory discourse within and constrained by interpretive communities, composed of the participants in a field of practice who set the parameters of what constitutes reasoned argumentation for that practice. Drawing insights from the theory of communicative action, the article claims that minimal preconditions for this discursive interaction exist in and around the Security Council. The debates over Kosovo are offered as evidence that the legal discourse not only occurs but has independent influence even in that political setting. While legal considerations did not directly cause any decision, concerns about precedent and reputation did influence positions taken as well as subsequent developments in the UN and NATO. The article concludes with an illustrative suggestion as to how Security Council deliberations could be improved, namely the adoption of a set of considerations to be taken into account in debates on humanitarian intervention. The suggested reform would not do away with the influence of hard power and perceived national interest, but, to paraphrase Jurgen Habermas, would give \u2018the power of the better argument\u2019 a fighting chance in Council decision\u2010making.",

      "abstract": "This paper brings the transitions literature into conversation with constructivist Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives on participation for the first time. In doing so we put forward a conception of public and civil society engagement in sustainability transitions as co-produced, relational, and emergent. Through paying close attention to the ways in which the subjects, objects, and procedural formats of public engagement are constructed through the performance of participatory collectives, our approach offers a framework to open up to and symmetrically compare diverse and interconnected forms of participation that make up wider socio-technical systems. We apply this framework in a comparative analysis of four diverse cases of civil society involvement in UK low carbon energy transitions. This highlights similarities and differences in how these distinct participatory collectives are orchestrated, mediated, and subject to exclusions, as well as their effects in producing particular visions of the issue at stake and implicit models of participation and \u2018the public\u2019. In conclusion we reflect on the value of this approach for opening up the politics of societal engagement in transitions, building systemic perspectives of interconnected \u2018ecologies of participation\u2019, and better accounting for the emergence, inherent uncertainties, and indeterminacies of all forms of participation in transitions.",

      "abstract": "This Article examines the tension between the demonstrable need for structured international cooperation in a world of interdependence and the political strain that arises whenever policymaking authority is lodged in global institutions. It argues that the tools of administrative law, which have been used to legitimate regulatory decisionmaking in the domestic context, should be deployed more systematically when policymaking is undertaken at the international level. While acknowledging the inevitable lack of democratic underpinnings for supranational governance, this Article highlights a series of other bases for legitimacy: expertise and the ability to promote social welfare; the order and stability provided by the rule of law; checks and balances; structured deliberation; and, most notably, the institutional design of the policymaking process as structured by principles and practices of administrative law. In developing the logic for procedural legitimacy as a foundation for good governance at the supranational scale, this Article advances a taxonomy of possible global administrative law tools. It then evaluates against this template of good governance procedures some existing decisionmaking procedures in the international trade, public health, and environmental policy regimes. The core conclusion is this: Even if supranational governance is limited and hampered by divergent traditions, cultures, and political preferences, developing a baseline set of administrative law tools and practices will strengthen whatever supranational policymaking is undertaken.",

Then it will take inspiration from classical and recent theories in legal sociology and legal anthropology to assess whether there is a theoretical basis for the demand for democracy. It concludes that there is no viable argument that would support requiring a direct democratic basis for international criminal courts, but there are clear points of departure for insisting that they should pursue wider social aims, for identifying these aims, and for identifying principles that can guide the conduct of relationships with affected populations.",

The new epistemology rests on a living logic of educational enquiry and living standards of judgment (Laidlaw, 1996) that include flows of life affirming energy with values that carry hope for the future of humanity. The presentation emphasizes the importance of the uniqueness of each individual\u2019s living educational theory (Whitehead, 1989) in improving practice and generating knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of individual creativity in contributing to improving practice and knowledge from within historical and cultural opportunities and constraints in the social contexts of the individual\u2019s life and work. The web-based version of this presentation demonstrates the importance of local, national and international communicative collaborations for improving practice and generating knowledge in the context of globalizing communications. Through its multi-media representations of educational relationships and explanations of educational influence in learning it seeks to communicate new living standards of judgment. These standards are relationally-dynamic and grounded in both improving practice and generating knowledge. They express the life-affirming energy of individuals, cultures and the cosmos, with values and understandings that it is claimed carry hope for the future of humanity.",

Specifically, the paper proposes forming the capability of students to become and to be 'strong evaluators', able to make reflexive and informed choices about what makes a good life for each of them. Evaluating equality and justice in higher education, and specifically the case of 'widening participation', is then greatly advanced by considering the conceptual tools provided by Amartya Sen's capability approach. The paper therefore elaborates on Sen's ideas and demonstrates their applicability in relation to widening participation student voices gathered in research interviews. Important though Sen's ideas are, there are barriers that stand in the way of taking up these ideas educationally. While three such barriers are acknowledged in the paper, four resources of possibility for recovering widening participation as capability formation from neoliberal and other forms of instrumentalism are also sketched.",

This could be the case if the increased public intensity of debate and polarisation of opinion brought about by politicisation do not fragment the audience and if arguments presented in public are sufficiently clear about the desired nature of the polity. To answer this question, the focus of this article is on dynamic contestation in the public sphere using original data of news platforms and political blogs in 12 EU Member States and transnational websites during the European Parliament election campaign of 2009. The results are, first, that diffuse eurosceptic evaluations dominate public debates despite large variation in the intensity of debate across Member States. Second, a majority of evaluations made, particularly those by citizens leaving comments online, are negative in all countries included in this study. A gap between elites and citizens persists, but it appears less pronounced than often proclaimed in the literature. And third, democracy is a primary concern in EU polity contestation, especially for those evaluating the EU negatively. Although little evidence is found of a fragmentation of audiences, the prominence of diffuse euroscepticism poses a major challenge to legitimation of the Union.",

It aims to support IS researchers and practitioners in the difficult process of identifying and scrutinizing the diverse issues they face in any ISD project. Two main components of the approach are a hierarchic arrangement of these issues, and of the basic kinds of validity claims they imply, in the form of a philosophical staircase; and a practical framework for critical discourse on these claims called critically systemic discourse. The present first part introduces the staircase and discusses the relevance of the discursive principle for dealing with the various validity claims raised by each one of its steps. The second part will present a discursive framework for applying the staircase.",

As far as the democratic legitimacy of constitution making at the supra-state level is addressed at all, scholars usually resort to democratic intergovernmentalism. According to this normative model, processes in which constitutional norms in the global realm are made or amended are democratically legitimate if they are organized as treaty making among the executives of democratic states, followed by parliamentary ratification. In this article, I argue that this model should be rejected because it puts the democratic legal domestication of public authority at risk. Specifically, democratic intergovernmentalism is characterized by five shortcomings: (a) it does not distinguish between norms of contractual and constitutional quality; (b) it undermines the separation of powers; (c) it breaches the division and hierarchization of constituent and constituted powers; (d) it disregards the deliberative dimension of democratic control; and (e) it does neither provide the citizens nor their representatives with a capacity to begin. Ultimately, I suggest that a superior approach should build on the notion of constituent power.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Multi-stakeholder initiatives involve actors from several spheres of society (market, civil society and state) in collaborative arrangements to reach objectives typically related to sustainable development. In political CSR literature, these arrangements have been framed as improvements to transnational governance and as being somehow democratic. We draw on Mouffe\u2019s works on agonistic pluralism to problematize the notion that consensus-led multi-stakeholder initiatives bring more democratic control on corporate power. We examine two initiatives which address two very different issue areas: the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety (The Accord). We map the different kinds of adversarial relations involved in connection with the issues meant to be governed by the two initiatives, and find those adversarial relations to take six main shapes, affecting the initiatives in different ways: (1) competing regulatory initiatives; (2) pressure-response relations within multi-stakeholder initiatives; (3) pressure-response relations between NGOs and states through multi-stakeholder initiatives; (4) collaboration and competition between multi-stakeholder initiatives and states; (5) pressure-response relations between civil society actors and multi-stakeholder initiatives; and (6) counter-hegemonic movements against multi-stakeholder initiatives as hegemonic projects. We conclude that multi-stakeholder initiatives cannot be democratic by themselves, and we argue that business and society researchers should not look at democracy or politics only internally to these initiatives, but rather study how issue areas are regulated through interactions between a variety of actors\u2014both within and without the multi-stakeholder initiatives\u2014who get to have a legitimate voice in this regulation.",

      "abstract": "The Eurozone crisis revealed fundamental flaws in the institutional architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union. Its lack of political steering capacity has demonstrated the need for a broad but seemingly unachievable political union with shared economic governance and a common treasury. Agreement on further measures has been difficult to achieve, as different actors have imposed divergent external criteria for the success of the Eurozone. As part of their heritage in Western Marxism, the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School sought to overcome such problems by identifying internal standards for social criticism. Building on their understanding of immanent critique, I argue that the Eurozone already contains the normative principles necessary to support greater political integration. While the citizens of Europe must provide the democratic legitimation necessary to realize this latent potential, the flaws revealed by the crisis are already pushing Europe towards greater transnational solidarity.",

Writers have examined many of the implications of these multifaceted trends for educational institutions but, with few exceptions, have yet to address the intersection of globalization and community service learning. Concerns for diversity, global citizenship, youth empowerment, community development, and the like which can be theorized as aspects of globalization, are evident in the field\u2019s literature and practice, but have not been linked through a theoretical framework that could help service-learning educators consider the implications of globalization for our work. 1",

Yet, democratic citizens habitually suspect political rhetoric as being either deceitfully empty or dangerously subversive. Rhetoric is thus central in democracy while paradoxically appearing either useless or pernicious. A consequence of this paradox for democratic leaders is that they are forced to avoid fine oratory in favour of a rhetorical style that sounds un-rhetorical, seeming to be plain factually-informative speech. This unique democratic form of rhetoric, which we have called an artless art, seeks to instil trust and to avoid appearing to talk down to the sovereign people. It is both helped and rendered problematic by the media, the essential communicative means in modern society, whose current dominance presents ever-new challenges and opportunities to democratic leaders.",

This article argues that, in order to bridge that gap and facilitate deliberative scenarios, more attention must be paid to the sociological core of deliberative democracy, namely, interpersonal communication. Dialogue scholarship has gained momentum over the past decade, offering a way forward in terms of enlarging the concept of deliberation while enriching its processes. This article proposes some reflections towards an integrated model of dialogue and deliberation (D+D) for collaborative policy making scenarios. The purpose is to explore, from a pragmatic and post-empiricist orientation, this particular crossroads of political science and communication scholarship.",

Although Max Weber\u2019s significant aims in composing his text were, blatantly, to evaluate the contemporary world, the density of the Weberian text, the fruit of a unique erudition, revealed an in-depth and singular analysis of the ancient Greek city. The purpose of this article is to analyze Weber\u2019s interpretive choices, in the light of historiographical criticism and a careful analysis of the Typology, in articular as regards the ideal types which he made to understand the city of the ancient Greeks.",

Weber's interpretive sociology, however, was typological. The actor to whom Weber referred in his sociological work was almost always an ideal type, usually the 'average' member of a sociologically significant social stratum. The subjective meaning of the action Weber assigned when constructing such an ideal type was the 'generally intended meaning' the action typically has for members of such strata. By examining Weber's methodological and substantive writings, particularly 'Basic Sociological Concepts', some implications of his typological approach for understanding his concept of subjective meaning, of the individual actor, and of interpretive sociology are discussed, including a critique of the view that Weber was a methodological individualist.",

To this end, it draws on the insights of interpretive sociology, particularly the construction of ideal types. To interpret the information, we draw on the categories set forward in Max Weber\u2019s sociology of religion. The article proposes four pure types of motivation for ecstatic experience: ecstasy as a method of producing a miracle; ecstasy as a method of confirming the Pentecostal path of salvation; ecstasy as a method of sanctification directed towards the earthly realm; and ecstasy as a means of sanctification that allows escape from the earthly realm.

      "abstract": "Gene Regulatory networks that control gene expression are widely studied yet the interactions that make them up are difficult to predict from high throughput data. Deep Learning methods such as convolutional neural networks can perform surprisingly good classifications on a variety of data types and the matrix-like gene expression profiles would seem to be ideal input data for deep learning approaches. In this short study I compiled training sets of expression data using the Arabidopsis AtGenExpress global stress expression data set and known transcription factor-target interactions from the Arabidopsis PLACE database. I built and optimised convolutional neural networks with a best model providing 95 % accuracy of classification on a held-out validation set. Investigation of the activations within this model revealed that classification was based on positive correlation of expression profiles in short sections. This result shows that a convolutional neural network can be used to make classifications and reveal the basis of those calssifications for gene expression data sets, indicating that a convolutional neural network is a useful and interpretable tool for exploratory classification of biological data. The final model is available for download and as a web application.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:Max Weber's Ancient Judaism is often seen as difficult or simply outdated. However, it contains stimulating perspectives. In order to clarify the theoretical framework, I suggest a comparative reading with The City in Economy and Society. The theoretical framework of Ancient Judaism can be viewed as an ideal type, 'Israel and Greece'. The ideal type is related with the religious and the political accordingly. Moreover, these are thought of as ambivalent. Observing the concept 'the ethic of ultimate ends and the ethic of responsibility', we can see the sharpened tension between the religious and the political. Certainly, this view would be effected by the severe situation in Germany during and right after the First World War. In spite of that, the work still has some significance in the history of philosophy, especially in Weber's integration of methodologies to interpret complicated social phenomena.",

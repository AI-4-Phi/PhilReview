      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to discern intersections between the intellectual path of the young Habermas and the issues addressed by the Positivismusstreit, the dispute between Popper and Adorno about methodology in the social sciences. I will present two perspectives, focusing on different temporal moments and interpretative problems. First, I will investigate the young Habermas\u2019 relationship to the intellectual tradition of the Frankfurt School: his views on philosophy and the social sciences, normative bases of critical theory and political attitudes. Second, I will reconstruct Habermas\u2019 contemplation of the Positivismusstreit, in light of his social scientific research programme in the 1960s. The thesis supported is that Habermas developed a position diverging from those of Adorno and Horkheimer, and that his position reasserted the agenda of the \u2018first critical theory\u2019. This article highlight the discontinuity between the first and the second generation of the Frankfurt School, the constructive openness to other philosophical and sociological traditions, as well as the aporias of a theory of knowledge not yet oriented towards the programme of reconstructive sciences",

      "abstract": "Hi ha molts soci\u00f2legs que tracten la comunicaci\u00f3 d'una manera m\u00e9s o menys marginal, per\u00f2 les teories sociol\u00f2giques no la tenen en compte, amb les seves mediacions t\u00e8cniques, com un \u00e0mbit definit de les estructures de la societat. Es crida l'atenci\u00f3 sobre els perills que comporta la molta recerca emp\u00edrica que es fa sense tenir un marc te\u00f2ric general prou clar. Els soci\u00f2legs alemanys, comen\u00e7ant per Max Weber, continuant amb els de l'Escola de Frankfurt, amb les seves diferents generacions, i acabant amb el funcionalisme sist\u00e8mic, s\u00f3n els qui m\u00e9s s'han ocupat dels temes referents a la comunicaci\u00f3. Per\u00f2 s'assenyala que han estat J\u00fcrgen Habermas i Niklas Luhmann els autors que m\u00e9s s'han acostat a tractar la comunicaci\u00f3 tal com, al meu entendre, f\u00f3ra de desitjar.Many sociologists view communication as a peripheral subject and sociological theories and their technical mediations don't treat communication as a defined field of social structures. The author emphasises the dangers entailed by the considerable amount of empirical research carried out without a clear enough general theoretical framework. German sociologists, beginning with Max Weber, followed by the Frankfurt School and its different generations, and culminating with systemic functionalism, have been dedicated to the subject of communication. The author specifies that, in his opinion, J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Niklas Luhmann are the two figures that approach this subject most successfully",

      "abstract": "The Eurozone crisis has revealed fundamental flaws in the institutional\n\narchitecture of the European Economic and Monetary Union. Its lack of political steering\n\ncapacity has demonstrated the need for a broad but seemingly unachievable political\n\nunion with shared economic governance and a common treasury. Agreement on further\n\nmeasures has been difficult to achieve as different actors have imposed different criteria\n\nfor the success of the Eurozone from the outside. As part of the heritage of Western\n\nMarxism, the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School sought overcome such problems\n\nby identifying criteria for social criticism from the inside. Building on their\n\nunderstanding of immanent critique, I argue that the Eurozone contains the internal\n\nnormative principles necessary to support greater political integration. While the citizens\n\nof Europe must provide the democratic legitimation necessary to realize this latent\n\npotential, the flaws revealed by the crisis are already pushing Europe towards greater\n\ntransnational solidarity",

      "abstract": "Alexander\u2019s theory of the civil sphere can be placed in the context of development of sociology of law. However, Alexander draws not so much on sociological theories but rather on the approaches of philosophy of law, particularly the ideas of Fuller, Dworkin and Habermas. The civil sphere is presented by Alexander as the embodiment of Dworkin\u2019s principal integrity. Locating law within civil morality Alexander reveals the similarity of his viewpoint to Dworkin\u2019s position. Drawing on Fuller\u2019s works Alexander singles out the procedural foundations of the democratic order. At the same time for Alexander the source of morality of law is not the legal system itself but a certain level of civil solidarity. Like Habermas, Alexander emphasizes the culturally embedded character of the legal norms. Alexander shares Habermas\u2019s understanding of law as a regulative mechanism affecting all spheres of social life. However, Habermas is more sensitive to the danger of colonization of law by the imperatives of the economic and political subsystems. Alexander\u2019s approach can be contrasted with Luhmann\u2019s sociological theory of law. Alexander concentrates on interrelation and mutual penetration of the civil sphere and law while Luhmann regards law as an autonomous system following its own logic. While Alexander claims that his theory is rooted both in sociology and philosophy of law in fact his approach is closer to normative philosophy",

      "abstract": "A central concern of critical theory is that of how the forces of Modern reason cause certain logics to become reified in the name of rational progress. Two such logics \u2013 the ongoing spread of liberal capitalism, and territorial particularism \u2013 are simultaneously embodied within social institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) that regulate the global economy, a phenomenon that occurs on the premise of maximising global welfare. Building upon a critical reading of J\u00fcrgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, this article undertakes an empirical immanent critique of the extent to which such logics repress the possibility of normative imperatives being considered within agricultural trade negotiations. Specifically, it argues that the dialectic of functionalist and communicative rationality, operating as a theoretical heuristic, reveals that the DDA is susceptible to an ethical indictment that arises from its inability to countenance the alternatives to the dual logics of neo-liberalism and state-interest that could otherwise emerge from a free and rational discussion. The nature of the WTO as a site of social action is revealed to be that of a closed epistemic community in which important normative claims are repressed, and as such, one in which the underlying rational bases for communication are fundamentally distorted",

Uncovering the intellectual relationships Morgenthau had with Max Weber, Friedrich Nietzsche, members of the Frankfurt School, or even Carl Schmitt has not only revealed the development of political discourses in the Weimar Republic, but it has helped to rectify interpretational shortcomings of realism and encouraged scholarship to apply realist principles to twenty-first century world politics. Despite this comprehensive contextualisation, the 'thinking partnership' between Morgenthau and Hannah Arendt has attracted so far only rhapsodic elaborations. This neglect is surprising because, at a time when the financial crisis in Western democracies is gradually turning into a crisis of democracy itself, a close reading of them offers a kind of social criticism whose implications are worthy of consideration",

      "abstract": "The social theoretic turn inaugurated under the rise of constructivism in International Relations has, among other themes, created a much-enlarged space for treating norms as efficacious explanatory variables in analyses of world politics. In this article, I reconstruct mainstream constructivists\u2019 inclinations toward what I argue are sociological accounts of norms, in which the question of the latter\u2019s justification is comprehensively sidelined. I initially show how constructivists\u2019 strategy of delineating their approaches from Critical Theory and post-structural analyses sustains social theoretic commitments, which compound this problem. In the second part of the article, I focus on Richard Price\u2019s programmatic attempt to reconcile the constructivist achievements in empirical research on the efficacy of norms with normative theorizing. The idea of building a bridge from \u2018isses\u2019 to \u2018oughts\u2019 labors, as I demonstrate, from the outset under construction problems, which cannot be resolved on the premises from which Price seeks to operate. Concluding this part, I consider the possibility of supplementing Price\u2019s account with consequentialist normative theory, and demonstrate that this would incur further problems for a normative theoretic framework for the study of world politics. In the final part, I outline key themes of Critical Theory with the aim of addressing some persistent misunderstandings about its scope, social theoretic outlook, and normative commitments. Linking back to the critical appraisal of mainstream constructivism\u2019s norm-sociological commitments, I suggest that despite some important limitations of its own, Critical Theory is in a better position to address \u2018isses\u2019 and \u2018oughts\u2019 than constructivists\u2019 readings of it would suggest",

The fact that Habermas has devoted a considerable part of his work to the elaboration of this philosophical programme indicates that discourse ethics can be regarded as a cornerstone of his communication-theoretic approach to society. In essence, Habermas conceives of discourse ethics as a philosophical framework which derives the coordinative power of social normativity from the discursive power of communicative rationality. Although there is an extensive literature on Habermas\u2019s communication-theoretic account of society, almost no attention has been paid to the fact that the theoretical framework which undergirds his discourse ethics is based on a number of binary conceptual divisions. It is the purpose of this paper to shed light on the philosophical significance of these binary categories in Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics and thereby demonstrate that their complexity is indicative of the subject\u2019s tension-laden immersion in social reality",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to proof the argument \u2013 i.e. \u2018there are significant linkages amongst tolerance, hybrid identities and migration.\u2019 These linkages can be comprehended by means of conceptualising extensions of hybrid identities in aggregate trans/inter-migration processes. It can be put forward that arising hybrid identities are embedded in a blurring structure of thoughts, beliefs, states of affairs, facts, belongings and so forth. From multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism viewpoints, it is argued that tolerance and migration ought to be analysed in frame of sociology of law, human rights, international migration law, and of course the European Union law. So far, normative arguments and soft law approaches are very much well integrated with social aspects of migration, tolerance, identity and culture. In this context, the study examines to what extent cultural and human components are protected by law in multiple levels from an interdisciplinary perspective. In this framework, it is crucial to raise the research enquiries: What are possible criteria for the limits of tolerance? To what extent tolerance is related to human rights and morality? What ought to be the limit of tolerance towards hybrid identities in multicultural and cosmopolitan societies? In a consistent manner, the criteria and standards developed by some leading scholars were reconstructed and discussed throughout this paper. These criteria and standards are both moral (part of a universal system of morality) and legal (international, supranational, or national \u2013 i.e. constitutional). In order to apply such standards their validity was discussed (i.e. the respective normative power has the norms at the various levels). In the case of morals, their difference to particular ethnic systems was established (i.e. criteria by which the two can be distinguished). Then the research argument was elaborated on whether and how the legal standards comply with the moral standards, how national standards comply with supranational or international standards. Likewise, the study highlights the crucial contributions of \u201cWorld Society and World System Paradigms\u201d that are associated with social space, global civil society, cosmopolitanism, ethnic diversity, cultural hybridity, human rights activism and public sphere. Recent debates in Refugee Studies (e.g. Syrian Refugee Crisis, Dual and Multiple Citizenship Issues and so forth) highlight the fact that the European Union needs to consider new aspects of tolerance for hybrid identities and tolerate cultural rights of hybrid identities, create cohesion in communities and establish intercultural dialogue amongst home-states and host-states. Sanguinely, the efforts of hybrid identities are strengthening the relations between home-host states and these ought to attract some considerable attention. The authors of this study hope that their endeavours may contribute somewhat towards that",

      "abstract": "The law of political economy is a contentious ideological field characterised by antagonistic relations between scholarly positions which tend to be either affirmative or critical of capitalism. Going beyond this schism, two particular features appear as central to the law of political economy: the first one is the way it epistemologically seeks to handle the distinction between holism and differentiation, i.e., the extent to which it sees society as a singular whole which is larger than its parts, or, rather, as a mere collection of parts. Different types of legal and political economy scholarship have given different types of answers to this question. The second feature of the law of political economy is the way in which it conceives of the relation between hierarchical and spontaneous dimensions of society, i.e., between firms and the market, or between public institutions and public opinion. The two distinctions can, however, be overcome through a third-way, emphasising the strategic role of law in mediating between holism and differentiation and hierarchy and spontaneity. This is demonstrated through a historical re-construction of the evolution of corporatist, neo-corporatist, and governance-based institutional set-ups of political economy",

Of course the discussion inevitably passes through methodological questions, opposing analytics vs. dialectics, idealistic vs. realists standpoints. In a effort to foment the inclusive dialogue between points of view concerning the concept of law that may create (not necessarily) radical opponents, the lines of conclusion intents to revisit some foundations of Hegelian \"method\" (so to speak) and intends to give a modest contribution to a more profound analysis of the relations between sein and sollen categories, in order to enrich the discussions about technology and social life, specially the life of the law nowadays",

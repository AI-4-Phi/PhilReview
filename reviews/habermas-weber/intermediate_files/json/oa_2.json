      "abstract": "The aim of this research essay is to examine the structural nature of theory in Information Systems. Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated.",

The analytical shifts leading up to the current preoccupation with international regimes have been both progressive and cumulative. And the field is pursuing its object of study in innovative ways that are bringing it closer to the theoretical core of more general international relations work. As we point out, however, the study of regimes as practiced today suffers from the fact that its epistemological approaches contradict its basic ontological posture. Accordingly, more interpretive strains, commensurate with the intersubjective basis of international regimes, should be included in the prevailing epistemological approaches. In addition, as a result of its enthusiasm for the concept of regimes, the field has tended to neglect the study of formal international organizations. Interpretive epistemologies can also help to link up the study of regimes with the study of formal international organizations by drawing attention to the roles these organizations play in creating transparency in the behavior and expectations of actors, serving as focal points for the international legitimation struggle, and providing a venue for the conduct of global epistemic politics.",

The value of history is presented in its interpretive power, in both investigating the particular through individual cases and how these are related to larger societal forces of change producing explanation, establishing causal relations, and achieving understanding as Verstehen in its full hermeneutic sense.

See Weber's opus magnum, Economy and Society (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1968) for the classic definition of bureaucratisation \u2013 compartmentalisation is inevitable the more an organisation becomes bureaucratic. 7. Even though it has become common practice in the English\u2010speaking world to use the terms 'leadership' and 'administration' synonymously in education to denote formal positions of authority, many still maintain a distinction between the two (as one can note in the titles in note 9). Following to some extent in the Weberian tradition, but also in the public administration tradition, this author recognises the distinction as follows: administrative roles are those that are formally structured and whose legitimacy and power are sanctioned through policy regimes that do not require acceptance of the person but the responsibilities of the office; leadership roles, on the other hand, are constructed in interpersonal relationships that are not necessarily formally sanctioned, whose legitimacy is conferred by followers on individuals for their personal qualities, and whose value is not bound by existing organisational or institutional purpose and policy regimes. In other words, administration is an organisationally constituted formal category, and leadership is a personally constructed political category. 8. The International Handbook does include a few chapters that have short subsections providing historical overviews of educational programs and research approaches; however, they play a marginal role in the overall publication. 9.

      "abstract": "Hermeneutics has much to offer those interested in qualitative inquiry, and is especially suitable for work of a textual and interpretive nature, yet writings in hermeneutics are frequently viewed as dense and impenetrable, particularly to North American audiences and those unfamiliar with the Continental Philosophical tradition. Drawing on Hans Georg GADAMER, as well as other hermeneutic thinkers, an introductory overview of five characteristics of a hermeneutic approach is offered in this paper. Further, it is suggested that hermeneutics can fruitfully be partnered with a critical approach. In this regard, a critical attitude and a metaxological approach are explored and a conceptualization of critical hermeneutics is proposed. It is suggested that hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics implicitly underpin qualitative inquiry, both of which emphasize the interpretive act of understanding, and a dialogue on this subject is invited.

      "abstract": "The dream of a cosmopolitical utopia has been around for thousands of years. Yet the promise of being locally situated and at the same time globally connected and mobile has never seemed more possible than it is today. The question remains as to whether it is positive and realistic for us to have multiple loyalties. Can we sustain community and solidarity with our neighbours while we look beyond our nation? And if we can't - or won't \u2013 consider distant strangers as part of our own world, are there increasingly dire consequences? This book reconnects classical sociological theory and contemporary ideas on mobility, otherness, material assemblages, consumption and surveillance to render the idea of a global cosmopolitan utopia amenable to sociological investigation. The book takes a realistic approach to the development of cosmopolitical arrangements. It embraces the imaginative impulses the cosmopolitan dream provides, but takes into account the political, ethical and cultural dimensions of such cosmopolitan developments. In revisiting the relevance of classical sociological approaches in the context of contemporary theoretical challenges, the distinctive approach this book takes to understanding cosmopolitanism will be of use to scholars and students alike.",

      "abstract": "While sociological concepts have often been implicitly used in International Relations (IR), recent years have seen a more explicit engagement between IR and Sociology. As with any such interdisciplinary assignation, there are both possibilities and challenges contained within this move: possibilities in terms of reducing IR's intellectual autism and opening the discipline towards potentially fertile terrain that was never, actually, that distant; challenges in that interdisciplinary raiding parties can often serve as pseudonyms for cannibalism, shallowness and dilettantism. This forum reviews the sociological turn in IR and interrogates it from a novel vantage point\u2014how sociologists themselves approach IR concepts, debates and issues. Three sociological approaches\u2014classical social theory, historical sociology and Foucauldian analysis\u2014are critically deployed to illuminate IR concerns. In this way, the forum offers the possibility of (re)establishing exchanges between the two disciplines premised on a firmer grasp of social theory itself. The result is a potentially more fruitful sociological turn, one with significant benefits for IR as a whole.",

      "abstract": "In 1930, during the Great Depression, Professor Karl Llewellyn declared in the Harvard Law Review that \u201cferment\u201d was abroad in the land and legal scholarship, declaring \u201crealism\u201d a powerful scholarly force. In the past year, we have seen our own ferment: the world has shown us the folly of some of legal scholarship\u2019s most powerful intellectual assumptions about the wisdom and rationality of markets and the inevitable failures of politics. Given current events, this article identifies and critiques an emerging body of legal theory that has dubbed itself \u201cnew legal realism.\u201d Over 280 articles have already used this moniker. This article surveys and analyzes this scholarship, arguing that \u201cnew legal realism\u201d is responding to a shared concept of a \u201cnew formalism\u201d - neoclassical law and economics. New legal realists are not anti-economics (some of them are economists themselves), but they are challenging the new formalism\u2019s assumptions about the state, the individual, and legal theory. The article identifies four central attributes for a new legal realism - empirical study, institutional analysis, philosophical pragmatism and critical reflexivity. It critiques various forms of new legal realist scholarship, from behavioral economics to legal empiricism, and offers suggestions about future directions for a legal theory more capable of addressing our vulnerable national order, including the possibility of new \u201cemergent\u201d legal analytics, replacing or complementing functionalism with participation-centered concepts, recognizing human vulnerability rather than assuming autonomy, moving beyond the old law/politics divide, theorizing doctrine as semi-autonomous and mediated by institutions, and recognizing that the pursuit of all goals and values is transformed by institutions with their own reflexive processes - in sum, building mediating theory that emerges recursively from empirical study and practice.",

This paper attempts a critical analysis of the theoretical assumptions which go into life\u2010event research. The focus is sociological, i.e. the question is asked in what way coping can be conceptualized as social action. Three types of coping are discerned in the life\u2010event literature, namely, psycho\u2010physiological, psychological, and social. It is argued that the analysis of psychological coping calls for an ethnomethodological paradigm while the study of social coping necessitates a Marxist approach.",

      "abstract": "The HSR Focus presents a psycho-societal approach to qualitative empirical research in several areas of everyday social life. It is an approach which integrates a theory of subjectivity and an interpretation methodology which integrates hermeneutic experiences from text analysis and psychoanalysis. Its particular focus is on subjectivity - as an aspect of the research object and as an aspect of the research process. By the term 'approach' is indicated the intrinsic connection between the theorizing of an empirical object and the reflection of the research process and the epistemic subject. In terms of methodology it revives the themes originally launched in FOS exactly ten years ago: 'Subjectivity and Reflectivity in Qualitative Research' (Breuer, Mruck and Roth 2002; Mruck and Breuer 2003). This editorial introduction presents the intellectual background of the psycho-societal methodology, reflects on its relevance and critical perspectives in a contemporary landscape of social science, and comments the way in which an international and interdisciplinary research group has developed this approach to profane empirical research.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this article is to render global university rankings (GURs) as a paradigmatic instance of knowledge/power (Foucault) within our post-industrial \u2018knowledge societies\u2019. At the same time, I examine a possible connection between GURs and \u2018scientification\u2019 of social sciences and humanities (SSH), i.e. promotion of the belief that if SSH are to count as \u2018sciences\u2019 proper, they must subscribe to the epistemological and methodological tenets of positivist-empiricist natural sciences. Based on recent literature and on the methodological information that is provided by the compilers of GURs on the relevant websites, the second part of the article traces some structural features (such as underestimation of teaching and systematic biases of bibliometrics) which might be taken as supporting the hypothesis that GURs are connected with the the wider trend of scientification of social sciences and humanities. I conclude that, even if we could ever overcome the deficiencies of existing rankings, we should take seriously that there can be no ranking system that would be epistemically objective, value neutral, and politically incontestable.",

VI.337\u201338)1 \"Reason is the specific characteristic of man, as a being living in personal activities and habitualities.\" (Vernunft ist das Spezifische des Menschen, als in personalen Aktivit\u00e4ten und Habitualit\u00e4ten lebenden Wesens, Husserl, Crisis, 338/Hua. VI.272) 1. Particular Historicities and Universal Reason In this paper2 i shall explore\u2014and suggest a way of resolving\u2014the evident tensions to be found in Husserl's Crisis of European Sciences (and associated texts) [End Page 463] between his commitment to the universality of reason as the goal or telos of European humanity (founded on the ancient Greek \"breakthrough\" to philosophy and science) and his recognition of the empirical plurality and \"relativity\" (Relativit\u00e4t) of individual peoples and nations (e.g. Indian, Chinese, Papuan, Bantu) locked into their own particular \"socialities\" (Sozialit\u00e4ten), communal worlds, and historical trajectories (what Husserl broadly calls \"historicities,\" Geschichtlichkeiten, Historizit\u00e4ten). 3 I shall examine the complex relations and tensions between Husserl's conception of universality, whereby the same reason functions in every human as animal rationale, \"no matter how primitive he is\" (\"Origin of Geometry,\" Crisis, 378/ Hua. VI.385), and his concept of the self-enclosed particularity of individual peoples with their own cultural forms. Indeed, Husserl often emphasizes that the most prominent feature of cultural plurality is precisely its relativity: \"relativity belongs to the normal course of life.\"4 I shall evaluate Husserl's response, which defends the project of realizing the ideal of a critical universal rationality, by situating his discussion in terms of the cultural conflict of the time with the rising National Socialist commitment to racial particularism, and by showing Husserl's commitment to the inherent universality of the one shared life-world. In his research manuscripts of the 1920s and 1930s Husserl frequently discusses the complex relationships that exist between different cultures and traditions; different cultures have their specific historicities (Crisis, 274/Hua. VI.320), dialects, norms, ways of life, and so on. This is simply a matter of fact. There are, furthermore, some well-known and controversial passages in Husserl's \"Vienna Lecture\" of May 1935 and also in his Crisis texts (both in the main 1936 published text, Part One [\u00a76] and in the then unpublished Crisis Part Three A \u00a7365) where Husserl speaks of the universality inherent in European philosophical culture of the logos and contrasts it with various other communal forms, which are, in his view, merely \"empirical-anthropological\" types, enclosed in their particular historicities and relativities. Indeed, in this context, Husserl regularly invokes the idea of the \"relativity of everything historical\" (die Relativit\u00e4t alles Historischen, Crisis, 373/Hua. VI.382). In addition, there are a number of related texts, collected in the Crisis supplementary volume (Hua. XXIX),6 in the Intersubjectivity volumes (especially Hua. XV),7 as well as in the recent volume on the life-world [End Page 464] (Hua. XXXIX),8 which discuss the empirical differences between peoples and also the layers and strata of social groups, nations, and even the idea of larger international collectivities or \"supernations\" (\u00dcbernationen), such as Europe, or the League of Nations. Furthermore, there are\u2014as Husserl indicates in his 1935 letter to the prominent French anthropologist Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl\u2014even cultures that are completely \"self-enclosed\" (abgeschlossene) unities, cut off, some of which know no history. According to Husserl, into this classical world of closed cultures, the ancient Greeks bring a new form of universality, one that leads them, through the grasp of idealization to infinite tasks, to break through the finite horizons of their environing world (Umwelt), which presents itself to them as a \"near-world\" (Nahwelt, Crisis, 324/Hua. VI.303; Hua. XXVII.228), and to arrive at the highly refined concept of the \"true world\" or the \"scientific world [which] is a purposeful structure (Zweckgebilde) extending to infinity\" (Crisis, 382...",

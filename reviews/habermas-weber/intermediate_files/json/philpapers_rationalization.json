        "The aim of this paper is to analyze which concept describes the central theme in Max Weber\u2019s works \u2014 the rationalization processes \u2014 best: disenchantment, alienation, or anomie. I first describe how Weber\u2019s rationalization processes were understood in the past.",
        "Since the majority have regarded disenchantment as the central theme of Weber\u2019s legacy, I discuss Weber\u2019s rare statements about the disenchantment process, most of which appear in a speech that was published later as Science as a Vocation. I then introduce definitions of key concepts (Hegelian alienation, Marxist alienation, Durkheimian anomie, and de-magification) to provide a more varied and precise vocabulary. This will aid in describing at least two different rationalization processes that can be derived from Webers theoretical framework (Economy and Society) and his historical studies.",
        "The first, in the economic and political sphere, can be characterized as Marxist alienation, whereas the second, in the religious sphere, can be interpreted as de-magification and Hegelian alienation. It is possible to regard Weber\u2019s statement in Science as a Vocation as a third rationalization process, in the sphere of knowledge production, which would suggest the concepts of de-magification and anomie.",

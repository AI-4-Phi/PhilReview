      "abstract": "This article seeks to analyse Jurgen Habermas\u2019 concept of communicative action and its links to a number of theoretical issues that connect it, in particular, to Max Weber. In this context, the idea of an argumentative rationality seems to be an intermediate concept between instrumental reason and normative ethics, in which ( Universal ) pragmatics becomes a means of guiding discourse through clarifying the ideal conditions for a social dialogue as political praxis, in order to overcome the constraints between life-world and system.",

      "abstract": "This article examines how artificial intelligence (AI) within data capitalism intensifies instrumental rationality, as critiqued by Max Horkheimer, while simultaneously distorting communicative rationality in the Habermasian sense. Using a conceptual\u2013analytical qualitative approach, it analyzes how algorithmic systems regulate social action by subordinating subjects to calculation, prediction, and efficiency. The study shows that the algorithmization of social life reduces human experience to units of datafication that can be predicted and modified, thereby deepening forms of technical domination. At the same time, algorithmically mediated digital public spheres are shaped more by platform commercial logics than by dialogic and deliberative norms, undermining conditions for democratic communication. By synthesizing Horkheimer and Habermas, the article proposes a conceptual framework for understanding contemporary forms of domination across technical and communicative domains and argues for the development of critical ethical\u2013normative frameworks and the reconstruction of digital public spaces that support communication free from domination.",

Therefore, the harmonious issue of supervisor-postgraduate relationship becomes an academic hot-spot. However, daily supervisor-postgraduate relationship is affected by the universal application of instrumental reason. In view of this, this paper draws on the core connotation of Habermas' theory of interactional behaviour to analyse the real dilemma of the current mentoring relationship, and to reconstruct the new era of graduate student mentoring relationship of mutual respect, understanding, equality, and harmonious coexistence in terms of four dimensions: interactional rationality, language, life world, and intersubjectivity.",

      "abstract": "More than forty years ago, J. Habermas published his two-volume Theory of Communicative Action in German, encapsulating over twenty years of reflection and research. The core concept of his intellectual pursuits was that the indestructible element of semantic rationality is rooted in the social form of communicative action, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive social theory, safeguarded through modern philosophy of language and science. In this book, as in his other works, J. Habermas intertwines an in-depth examination of theoretical traditions with his systematic argumentation, encompassing a wide range of scientific approaches. Reinterpreted theories from G. Mead, M. Weber, E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, and various versions of Marxism provided a system of conceptual coordinates within which J. Habermas recognized new ideas in social theory and tested those using factual arguments. After the book\u2019s publication, it garnered significant attention from the scientific community, which was remarkable considering the challenges it posed to readers. The initial published responses reflected its thematic complexity and ideological richness; the most common criticism, often expressed with the irony of a \u201chopelessly idealistic enterprise\u201d, was later refuted after deeper discussions. This criticism has persisted and is now supplemented with new arguments, which are countered by other counterarguments. Theory of Communicative Action has been translated into English, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has become the focal point of international discussions about social science theory. Few authors possess the argumentative skill, intellectual history knowledge, thematic breadth, and desire to diagnose the modern world required to address a variety of areas and answer pertinent questions. Those who do not participate in today\u2019s debates or have nothing to say about this influential social theorist effectively exclude themselves from being considered serious connoisseurs. The Russian edition of J. Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, translated by A. K. Sudakov and published by \u201cVes mir\u201d in 2022, was highly anticipated. However, disappointment soon followed when readers discovered the released version. Although the book\u2019s table of contents appears to align with the English translation by T. McCarthy (praised by both the global sociological community and J. Habermas himself), a closer examination of the Russian text reveals that it primarily consists of \u201csimulacra\u201d (semblances) of the original translation. According to J. Baudrillard\u2019s precise definition of \u201csimulacrum,\u201d this means it is merely an \u201cimitation of the non-existent\u201d and gives the impression of something that isn\u2019t truly there. The primary issue is that translator A. K. Sudakov disrupted the key semantic context by replacing the fundamental term \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (\u201chandeln,\u201d or \u201caction\u201d in the English translation) with the unrelated term \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u201ct\u00e4tigkeiten,\u201d \u201cactivity\u201d). From a modern sociological theory perspective, using the term \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (communicative activity) instead of \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (communicative action) is a significant violation of the logical progression and development of initial premises. Habermas formulated his concept of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d based on T. Parsons\u2019 approach to defining \u201caction\u201d as a singular social act, while the category of \u201cactivity\u201d is rooted in an extremely broad definition of \u201chuman activity\u201d. This article examines numerous glaring errors and distortions in the translations that not only affect the semantic structures of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d but also the entirety of modern sociology. As a result, the review is titled \u201cSimulacra of Translation\u201d to highlight these issues through various examples of factual \u201creinterpretations\u201d of the book\u2019s key meanings and concepts.",

      "abstract": "In prediction-allocation problems, predictions are used to allocate social goods. Standard methodology recommends factoring these problems into two stages: first, individual outcomes are predicted as accurately as possible; second, allocations are made based on these predictions. But when predictions inform allocation, they causally influence outcomes. The \u201cperformative\u201d nature of these predictions entangles epistemic and pragmatic considerations, making notions of accuracy ambiguous. Two families of responses propose to correct the standard procedure. Emphasizing the epistemic, endogenization recommends making predictions that tend to make themselves true. Pragmatic encroachment recommends making the predictions with the best distributive consequences. We argue that both responses are misguided. The former undermines the normative goals of allocation. The latter, despite being instrumentally rational, has a distorting effect on communication. When predictions are expressions of substantive normative commitments, they cannot help resolve normative disputes among policymakers and street-level bureaucrats. That is, they are not communicatively rational. We argue that one does not have to trade off instrumental and communicative rationality and introduce two criteria of adequacy for predictions: they should be decision- and discourse-supportive. These criteria can be met by predicting counterfactual outcomes. We argue that predictions satisfying these criteria can serve as public reasons.",

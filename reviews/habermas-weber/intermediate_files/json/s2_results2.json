      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThis research examines the relationship between philosophy and progress through the lens of the Frankfurt School's Critical Theory, exploring how its four generations criticized Western modernity's pathologies, including alienation, reification, and domination. The study reassesses key concepts such as rationality, freedom, and scientific progress, particularly criticizing the Enlightenment's emphasis on control through science and technology. By analyzing the paradigms of production, communication, recognition, and social acceleration, the research highlights the effectiveness of these cognitive models in diagnosing societal issues. A central question addressed is whether the insights of Critical Theory can be adapted to Arab societies to transform their socio-political realities. Through a critical analytical approach, the findings suggest that while the Frankfurt School's critique of Western modernity offers valuable tools, its frameworks must be adapted to local cultural and social contexts to address challenges specific to Arab societies, such as authoritarianism and social justice. Ultimately, the research concludes that Critical Theory, when localized, has the potential to contribute meaningfully to understanding and addressing the realities of Arab societies.",

To that end, in principle, it address the manner in which Giddens\u2019s and Habermas\u2019s perspectives and intellectual careers at various points in their work conceptualize and take part in certain epochal and theoretical crossroads: the tensions of the welfare state, the \u2018triumph\u2019 of neoliberalism and the revision of Marxism. Then, Browne\u2019s comparative study on both perspectives \u2013 which specifies their contributions, shortcomings and respective \u2018potential\u2019 concepts \u2013 is traced. Following that, the methodological dimension of the book is displayed, inasmuch as it is a methodological reflection on the theoretical research. Thus, a key relationship between the \u2018comparative-constructive\u2019 research method and Browne\u2019s view of critical theory is observed: an immanent critique regarding the theoretical-analytical problem of the philosophy of praxis. Lastly, points of contact are identified between the elaborations in the book and a reflection on the processes of sociological and social reclassification in the perspectives of Giddens and Habermas with respect to the possibilities of mutual practical transformations between social spaces in general and the conceptualizations and inquiries of sociology and social theory.",

Rorty, Public Reason, and Modernity's Crisis of Critique explores the contemporary crisis of rational justification and collective will-formation in our current political institutions and the public sphere, arguing that there is an array of untapped rational resources that should be deployed to justify social, political, and economic views, agendas, and programs. It also identifies limits to the powers of public reason to generate rational agreement and collective will-formation. Using a critical analysis of Rorty\u2019s non-foundationalist perspective as a vehicle to study modernity\u2019s project of rational critique, Ivan Marquez highlights both the strengths and promise and the weaknesses and limitations of liberal and democratic societies\u2014especially within pluralistic socio-cultural contexts\u2014and some possible ways to work within this space of possibilities and constraints. Ultimately, this book can be seen as elaborating a political epistemology view that argues for a redefinition of philosophy and defends a type of post-metaphysical culture.",

First, we argue that Habermas is not a strong foundationalist concerned with identifying universal rules for language, as postmodern critiques have often interpreted him. Instead, he develops a social pragmatics in which the communicative use of language is the fundamental presupposition of any meaningful interaction. Second, we argue that Lyotard is not a relativist who denies any universal linguistic structure. Instead, he claims that language involves a universal element of dissensus that cannot be subordinated to consensus. Third, we show that neither does Habermas defend a new version of the kind of philosophy of history characteristic of the Enlightenment, nor is Lyotard a historical relativist, but instead they both seek alternatives to these positions. The conclusion calls for more nuance in the interpretation of both perspectives.",

As distinct from the theories of modernity of the Enlightenment (Habermas) and their critique in the form of theories of power (Foucault, post-colonial philosophies), modernity is described as a complex process of various \u201cde-limitations\u201d, which is set in motion in Renaissance philosophy. Since in antiquity cosmology as well as the geography of the ecumene were each tied to anthropological, ethical and political conceptions respectively, the de-limitation of the cosmos (Cusanus, Copernicus) and the de-limitation of the ecumene by the European naval powers trigger scientific, political and cultural transformations reaching from the upvaluation of insatiable curiosity to the anthropological idea of experimental self-creation (Montaigne) up to the idea of limitless economic growth (Locke). Since rational, power-related and cultural ideas are amalgamated in the different de-limitations, this theory opens up a new perspective on the ambivalences of modernity.",

In their attempt to develop an interdisciplinary, reflexive, emancipatory and dialectical reason that is critical towards accepted realities, Horkheimer and Adorno in their monumental work The Dialectic of Enlightenment pictured a world trapped in instrumental rationality. Taking and revolutionizing traditional critical theory, Habermas argues that reason entails both emancipator as well as instrumental possibilities. Through an exposition of Habermas\u2019 critique of Horkheimer and Adorno in his discourse of modernity, this article argues that although Habermas successfully identifies the equation of the rational with the instrumental and offers an emancipator model in return; still he ends up not paying sufficient attention to aesthetic truth.",

      "abstract": "The paper argues on the Latin-American philosophy as a decolonial praxis which unveils and overcomes the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity (such as Max Weber and J\u00fcrgen Habermas). This historical-sociological blindness is characterized (a) by the separation between European culture and the modern Realpolitik of the colonialism as non-dependent and non-mutually-supported moments, and (b) by the reconstruction of the process of constitution of the European modernity as an endogenous, self-referential and basically internal movement of evolution, ignoring again its correlation and profound linking with colonialism. The paper argues that the critical and emancipatory role of the modernity\u2019s normative paradigm only is possible by that historical-sociological blindness. So, the Latin-American philosophy, the moment it denounces and unveils the historical-sociological blindness of the theories of modernity, points directly to the self-restraint of the modernity\u2019s normative paradigm as the basic theoretical-political agenda and praxis for a decolonial philosophy, as condition also to the correction of the modernity itself. Contrarily to Habermas, who defends the renewal of the modernity\u2019s normative paradigm as a non-fundamentalist epistemological-moral universalism, the decolonial philosophy will show that the historical-sociological blindness only can be resolved from the self-restraint of the modernity and from an anti-colonial politics based on the reparation for colonialism as a critical-normative concept for theoretical analysis and political praxis regarding modernity-modernization as a totalizing epistemological-cultural-societal movement towards colonialism.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

It analyzes the shifting intellectual motivations behind the study of Xunzi across distinct contexts \u2014 from the early modern transformation of Confucian learning into academic philosophy, to the materialist and Legalist readings shaped by Marxist ideology in the mainland, and the Song-Ming Neo-Confucian critiques that emerged in Taiwan and Hong Kong following the political bifurcation of the post\u2013New Culture era. The review shows that the contrasting positive and negative assessments of the same Xunzi texts were largely determined by the varying meanings attributed to \u201cmodernity\u201d within each of these interpretive paradigms. It also demonstrates that this reliance on external criteria produced certain limitations, including thematic bias and selective emphasis. While these earlier studies offer valuable historical insight, this paper argues that future research should move beyond inherited notions of modernity and instead employ analytically rigorous methods that attend to the complex philosophical structure of Xunzi\u2019s thought itself.",

However, the basis of the concept has been insufficiently examined. This re-examination of its conceptual basis explains the origins of the limitations and flaws in the wicked problems concept. This paper analyses and rejects the notion of \u2018wicked problems\u2019 on philosophical and practical grounds. We argue instead that the policy sciences already had better conceptualizations of public problems before Rittel and Webber\u2019s flawed formulation. We return to this literature, and build upon it by reframing \u2018wickedness\u2019 in terms of higher and lower levels of problematicity in problem structuring efforts. In doing so, we offer an alternative, novel combination of the philosophy of questioning and the policy work approach to policy practice. \u2018Wickedness\u2019 is re-conceptualized as problematicity, conceived as the distance between those who question or inquire into a policy problem. This is primarily a political distance, articulated in terms of ideas, interests, institutions and practices. High problematicity arises only when wide political distances are explicitly maintained, such that partial answers cannot be reached. Practitioners deal with problematicity by a dual practical strategy of balancing closing-down and opening-up sub-questions to the problem in order to structure them such that they become amenable to action through partial answers. This simultaneously incorporates a politics of negotiating political distance via partisan adjustment and serial strategic analysis. The argument constitutes a theoretically and practically superior alternative to the \u2018wicked problems\u2019 perspective.",

Showcasing contemporary Latin American approaches that align modernity with colonialism, and European theories of modernity, Hans Schelkshorn reassesses the origins of modernity. He brings neglected Renaissance thinkers into the narrative, discussing the work of Nicholas of Cusa, Pico della Mirandola, Francisco de Vitoria, and Michel de Montaigne, and critiquing the views of Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke.\n Across a series of historical studies, Schelkshorn presents modernity as a complex process. His use of the concept \u2018de-limitations\u2019 (Entgrenzungen) shows how the new idea of an infinite universe and the discovery of the Americas deeply influenced the foundations of modern science, politics and economies in the 17th century. Making a major contribution to scholarship on early modern philosophy, Schelkshorn paves the way for a more cosmopolitan account of European thought.\n The ebook editions of this book are available open access under a CC BY 4.0 licence on bloomsburycollections.com.

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "The modern/postmodern debate is usually presented as one of\u00a0 universality vs. relativism, rationalism vs. irrationalism and emancipation vs. deconstruction. This article tries to critically expose and critique Habermas\u2019s discussion of postmodernism as a way of highlighting some of the limitations of this lively discussion. This is to be accomplished through a conceptual analysis of Habermas\u2019s defense of modernity against the postmodernism of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault as elaborated in Habermas\u2019s work The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Through such an analysis, I will argue for the following points. (1) Habermas\u2019s discourse of modernity provides better accounts of responsibility and emancipation compared to the postmodernism of Derrida and Foucault. (2) Still,\u00a0 Habermas\u2019s discourse of modernity fails to fully address asymmetrical power relations and (3)\u00a0 Habermas\u2019s modernity is Eurocentric in failing to fully deconstruct the Eurocentric tendencies of the philosophical tradition of which it\u2019s a part.",

      "abstract": "Our proposal is aimed at analyzing a series of sacred forms that question that initial hallmark of the general theory of secularization which, based on a teleological conception, postulated a movement from the sacred to the profane, from the religious to the secular. These new sacred forms describe a different pattern that goes from the secular to the religious, as new forms of sacralization. In this sense, we analyze, first, the historical emergence of the grand narrative of secularization in Europe, which describes a unidirectional process from the religious to the secular. Second, we carry out a genealogical critique of the narrative of secularization. Third, we analyze the other direction in that dynamic tension that goes from the secular to the religious. Fourthly, we analyze new forms of sacralization that emerged in the French Revolution, in American \u201ccivil religion\u201d, in post-war Europe, in the commemorations of Memorial Day or Veteran\u2019s Day, in the Coronation Ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II, in the proto-event of 11 September 2001, in the sacralization of the person and in the sacralization of the child. \u201cSee to it that no one enslaves you through the vain fallacy of a philosophy, founded on human traditions, according to the elements of the world and not according to Christ.\u201d (Saint Paul, Epistle to the Colossians 2: 8); \u201cIn the imagination of the simple patriot, the nation is not a society but the Society. Although its values are relative, they appear, from his naive perspective, as absolute. The nation is always endowed with an aura of sacredness, which is the reason why religions, which claim universality, are so easily captured and domesticated by national sentiment, religion and patriotism converging in such a process.\u201d (Reinhold Niebuhr); \u201cEveryone can only choose for himself who for him is God and who is the devil because with respect to values, in fact, it is always and everywhere not only a matter of alternatives, but of an irreconcilable fight to the death, between \u2018god\u2019 and the \u2018devil\u2019.\u201d (Max Weber).",

      "abstract": "Abstract:Otto Neurath probably never read Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, but only perceived it through J.B. Kraus's book Scholasticism, Puritanism, and Capitalism. For Kraus, as a Jesuit, it was important to take a clear position in the conflict between Protestants and Catholics. The goal of his argument was to downplay and limit the importance of Protestantism to modern capitalism. He therefore hardly addresses Weber's particular argumentation. Neurath, in turn, presumably relied on Kraus in order to call upon a Jesuit as a key witness for Marxism. This as well as Neurath's well-known tendency for polemics made him follow Kraus, who with his criticism of Weber by means of Marx wanted to establish, as Neurath called it, a 'Marxism of a Jesuit' as a third way. Kraus's criticism triggered Neurath's misconception that Weber's writing should be understood as an anti-thesis to Marx. Surprisingly, he never realized how closely Weber's approach in the empirically based study corresponded with his own methodological approach of an empirical sociology.",

      "abstract": "Daniel Defoe\u2019s novel Robinson Crusoe takes a sailor named Alexander Selkirk as its prototype, telling a story of the protagonist Robinson Crusoe\u2019s life and adventure, especially his experience on an island for 28 years. Critics argue that there are two major themes in the novel: economic individualism and religious belief, and more or less believe that making a good fortune and spiritual pursuit are opposite. However, analysis of the protagonist from a single perspective--economics or religion--inevitably leads to contradiction of understanding the character. This paper analyzes Robinson Crusoe from the theoretical perspective of Max Weber\u2019s Protestant ethic and spirit of capitalism, seeking the \u201celective affinity\u201d of the two. Crusoe is an ambitious adventurer, a diligent laborer and a lonely ascetic, all of which has an elective affinity with the Protestant ethic. Meanwhile, Robinson Crusoe converts to religion to guide his life. His seemingly contradictory behaviors reflects that he is in fact a product of the elective affinity of the economic ideology and the religious consciousness.",

      "abstract": "The association between capitalism and Protestantism has invoked much controversy, as well as ingenuity. This paper compares Weber\u2019s analysis against a much more contemporary theoretical framework also known as social constructivism. Constructivism as a present-day social theory offers a compelling evaluation on how capitalism may have risen. While Weber offers the Protestant work ethic as a potential catalyst for his approach, his insights argue that capitalism can only limited to a specific theology, rendering the rest of the world incapable of capitalism. Although Weber\u2019s insights do function as Occam\u2019s Razor, his explanation for how capitalism may flourish in other parts of the world remains restrained. As an alternative social constructivism emphasizes a much better theoretical frame for capitalism that offers better explanation for how cultures may construct capitalist norms and relations.",

      "abstract": "Weber attempted to find the crucial cultural impetus that supports and propels the capitalist mode of production in the Protestant Ethic, namely the spirit of capitalism. He interconnected religion, culture, and socio-economics through rationalism, simultaneously delving into a conceptual issue, the \"transformation of ancient and modern,\" brought about by the development of rationalism. Building upon this, Weber uniquely examined how society and actions are irreversibly propelled by the force of these ideas to construct the \"iron cage\" of modernity. Therefore, placing \"Weber's proposition\" within the broader context of modern thought serves as a perspective to help us better understand and reflect on capitalism as a spirit of thought or ideology, as well as the crises hidden within the societal reality constructed upon it.",

This essay makes a profile of the Chinese translations of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, analyzes the reasons for the retranslations, and summarizes the major problems in these translations. The authors argue that, although there are some problems in the existing Chinese versions, the Chinese translations of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism play important roles in the reception and studies of Max Weber in China, and the deepening of Max Weber studies in return inspires more and better Chinese versions of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. The Chinese translations contribute not only to the study of Max Weber\u2019s The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, but also to the spread of Max Weber\u2019s thoughts in China.",

The reference is not accidental as it is in this work that Weber could consistently explicate his ethical argument. The idea of ethos becomes clearer in comparison with the concept of habitus, which is actively used today in social science. It is shown that the distinction between ethos and habitus may be more productive than the conflation common in modern research. The category \u201cethos\u201d is compared with the value-rational action from the later typology of action in Weber\u2019s \u201cEconomy and Society\u201d, while habitus is associated with traditional action from the same typology. The concept of ethos is further clarified by the example of Weber\u2019s opposition of traditionalism and ethical modern Western capitalism. By focusing on ethical issues and using character as a theoretical tool, Weber not only puts forward a convincing interpretation but lays the foundations for a specific line of analysis in social and economic science. The category of ethos in conjunction with the value-rational type of action acquires special significance due to the potential for novelty and change that is embedded in it.",

Since its publication at the beginning of the 20th century, this thesis, supported by subsequent great works by the German classic, has rarely been the subject of major controversy. The work of correcting Weber\u2019s thesis was undertaken in the late 20th century by Michael Novak. Novak\u2019s correction is not confrontational, but complementary. The American thinker abandons the research area of minority Protestant communities, which caught Weber\u2019s attention, and undertakes an analysis of the broader religious tradition, developing both before and after the Reformation. In particular, the achievements of Pope John Paul II, interpreted by Novak in terms of the renewal of a liberty current of Catholic social thought, provide important corrective data.",

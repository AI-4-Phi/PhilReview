      "abstract": "With the increase in regional economic development disparities, a regional coordinated development strategy is put forward that prioritizes human welfare and holistic social progress over a purely materialistic growth model. To address the challenges of balanced regional development, this paper has developed a multidimensional assessment framework of social development encompassing education, healthcare, culture, and social security. Using the entropy weight TOPSIS method, this study measures the social development level across 296 Chinese prefecture-level cities from 1990 to 2020. It explores the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of China\u2019s social development level through the Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition method and exploratory spatial data analysis. The results indicate that (1) the level of social development in China exhibits a fluctuating upward trend over the time series, showing a phase-wise pattern of decline\u2013rise\u2013rise; (2) there is a clear heterogeneity in the level of social development, with a general hierarchy of Eastern, Northeastern, Western, and Central regions in terms of social development; (3) spatially, China\u2019s social development level has evolved from a patchy distribution in 1990 to a clustered distribution around urban agglomerations by 2020, with pronounced characteristics of spatial imbalance; (4) the level of social development in China displays varying degrees of spatial clustering, with this trend intensifying over time; and (5) over the period 1990\u20132020, the overall disparity in China\u2019s social development level presents a fluctuating trend, with a notable reduction after an initial increase, and regional disparities following the order of Central, Western, Eastern, and Northeastern regions. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers and scholars seeking to understand and enhance China\u2019s social development landscape.",

      "abstract": "The field of international development has been shaped by a diverse set of theories, each offering distinct perspectives on how societies can achieve progress. From the linear growth model of modernization theory to the structural critiques of dependency and world-systems theories, these frameworks have influenced policy, funding priorities, and program design for decades. The rise of sustainable development reframed progress as a multidimensional goal, integrating environmental and social considerations alongside economic growth. More recent perspectives\u2014post-development and de-growth\u2014challenge the very foundations of traditional development, advocating for culturally grounded, ecologically responsible, and non-growth-oriented approaches. This paper examines these key theories, highlighting their conceptual foundations, critiques, and implications for contemporary non-profit practice. Understanding their strengths and limitations enables practitioners to design development initiatives that are contextually relevant, inclusive, and sustainable.",

      "abstract": "There is widespread agreement that we are living in an age of \u201cdemocratic backsliding,\u201d in which a growing number of formally democratic countries are falling behind previously achieved levels of democratization. But on what grounds can we claim that one level of democratic development is \u201chigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d than another? This question has rarely been systematically addressed in recent scholarship, despite the popularity of the language of \u201cbacksliding.\u201d Reacting to this, this article aims to retrieve a philosophically sophisticated account of democratic progress and regression from the work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a major figure of Frankfurt School Critical Theory. The article derives from Habermas's thought a distinctive conception of democratic progress, as well as three different meanings of \u201cdemocratic regression.\u201d It also discusses some implications for social science research on democratization.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the historical and ongoing struggles surrounding the reservation system in India, focusing on various communities such as Brahmins, Marathas, Kapus, and Jats. It highlights the systematic exclusion of marginalized groups from education and employment, which has perpetuated social and economic inequality. The discussion traces the evolution of the reservation system, including movements like the Maratha and Kapu struggles, which demand social justice and better representation. It also addresses the challenges these communities face in gaining affirmative action benefits, including legal battles and political interventions. The content emphasizes the significant role of historical movements and the need for inclusive policies to promote social and economic progress. The article states that reservation remains a key issue in achieving equality, and its impact on India's development continues to be a subject of intense debate and activism. \nAbstract in Hindi

The considerations carried out is to confirm the assumption made of the complex nature of trust and its role in social development. First of all, formal and legal entrustment arises when the formal requirements of the legal system are guaranteed \u2013 coherence, non-contradiction, differentiation, hierarchy. Secondly, trust in the law arises in the situation of the existence of institutional guarantees of the rule of law and the systemic principle of trust, which is expressed not in retroactivity, correctness of legislation, protection of acquired rights, protection of the so-called interests in progress. Taken together, the fulfilment of these requirements determines the stability of the state of law, the predictability of its application, legality, durability, and, consequently, the ontological security of individuals and social development.",

Then I turn to David Owen and Amy Allen's critiques of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. My aim is to develop their critique of Habermas by elucidating an important but neglected distinction between the developmental logic and the developmental dynamics in Habermas's theory of social evolution. Drawing on this distinction, I claim that Habermas's theory is problematic in that he underestimates the importance of the developmental dynamics. By introducing the distinction between individual learning and social learning, I also question\u00a0his account of progress as accumulative experience of learning. This is because, unlike cumulative culture at the level of phylogenesis, individuals ontogenetically experience a kind of non\u2010cumulative social learning. Unlike cumulative culture, each individual has to undergo a kind of non\u2010cumulative social learning. The problem is that Habermas conceives the learning process too narrowly such that learning does not guarantee social evolution.",

It first argues that the two authors held similarly complex theories that contained mixed elements of positivism and teleology \u2013in its positivist aspects, both authors made use of unified natural laws and, in its teleological aspects, they understood progress and the evolution of civilization along a linear path of progressive development. It is further examined how both authors made use of analogies between organisms and social aggregates\u2013in Freud's case, he formulated a libidinal analogy between the stages of psychosexual development and the civilizatory stages. Finally, it is examined the ethical commitments to the individual that are consequences of such an understanding of the natural law.",

      "abstract": "A new approach to understanding social and economic development is proposed, based on consideration of the evolution of coordination mechanisms. The work consists of two parts. In the first part, a critical analysis of four recently proposed theories of social development, focusing on geographical, institutional or cultural factors, is given. These theories have greatly enriched our understanding of the evolution of society, however, as analysis shows, none of them provides a satisfactory description of the driving forces and mechanisms of this evolution; the main reason is rooted in their common deficiency \u2014 monocausality. It is proposed to distinguish between two types of development, catching up and leading. The basic ideas of the theory of catching up development are presented. This approach makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d as a result of mutually conditioned changes in culture, institutions, technological progress and well-being in the context of interaction of competition, power and collaboration mechanisms.\n The second part is devoted to the theory of leading socioeconomic development. It is shown how in Western Europe, as a result of the interaction of the above four factors, specific forms and combinations of the three main mechanisms of coordination \u2014 competition, power and collaboration \u2014 emerged at each stage of evolution. I emphasize the importance of ideology and the phenomenon of technical progress in the formation of institutions of economic and political competition that contributed to the creation of the welfare state. These changes and economic growth created the conditions for further transformation of civil culture: increasing levels of trust, tolerance, altruism and cosmopolitanism, expanding the planning horizon. The decrease in the level of coercion built into the mechanisms of power and competition are demonstrated as well as the expansion of the role of collaboration. A hypothesis is advanced that the speed of this process depends on geographical factors. The idea of the welfare world is discussed.",

      "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of human development in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and India, two nations thathave pursued distinctly different development trajectories since 1990. Using data from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), this research evaluates the evolution of the Human Development Index (HDI) in both countries. The analysis employs the UNDP\u2019s HDI framework, which integrates indicators of health (life expectancy), education (mean and expected years of schooling), and standard of living (gross national income per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity).The findings reveal that the UAE, leveraging its oil wealth and centralized governance, has rapidly advanced into the Very High Human Development category, ranking 17th globally with a HDI score of 0.937 in 2022. Its success is attributed to strategic economic diversification, significant investments in healthcare and education, and efficient policy implementation. In contrast, India, ranking 134th with a HDI score of 0.644, has experienced steady, albeit slower, improvements driven by post-liberalization economic reforms, expansion of social welfare programs, and grassroots delivery of healthcare and education services. However,India continues to face challenges of income inequality, regional disparities, and access to quality public services.The paper concludes that while India can learn from the UAE\u2019s strategic vision and policy efficiency, the UAE could draw lessons from India\u2019s inclusive, bottom-up approaches to social development. The study offers policy recommendations aimed at enhancing human development outcomes in both countries and provides critical insights for other emerging and resource-rich economies seeking to balance growth with equity and sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Psychotherapies for the youth have resulted from the confluence of 3 major disciplines: adult psychology and psychiatry, developmental neurology and pediatrics, and developmental psychology and ethology. Since their humble origins in the psychoanalytically oriented play therapy and the related theories in the pre-War Germany, over more than a century, they have embraced diverse theoretical views that include but not limited to the integration of developmental issues, evolution of the child guidance movement, and the various influences of institutional and social policies. Such a rich journey has eventually resulted in evidence-based practices (EBPs)\u2014powerful interventions for children and families for complex behavioral problems. In this chapter, we attempt to trace the blooming field of youth psychotherapies in their historical contexts, provide an account of the existing gaps of knowledge, briefly narrate the modern-day developments, mostly regarding the multimodal/eclectic treatment aspects and finally, given their rapid growth, we speculate about their (positive) future. Child and adolescent therapies have progressed considerably, as reflected in the number of controlled studies, their methodological quality, and identification of evidence-based treatments. Despite the methodological difficulties in outcome studies, the field has witnessed major advances regarding the efficacy of selected treatments in child and adolescent psychotherapy and good quality meta-analyses do suggest that 75% of children and young people who attend therapy benefit from it. However, despite the comforting data related to efficacy, major challenges still remain, especially in regard to patient engagement and dropout rates, gap in knowledge about what works and why it works, cultural sensitivity, and data of cost- effectiveness\u2014just to quote a few. Several key areas have been neglected in research, such as the mechanisms of change, the moderators of treatment outcome, and the generalizability of the research findings to the clinical practice arena\u2014this has greatly limited what we know about treatment and partly explains the relative lack of personalized psychotherapies and scarcity in their dissemination/generalization despite the documented evidence on their efficacy. Tailoring treatment more specifically to each patient may be necessary to reduce this nonresponsiveness and dropping outs, as one treatment does not fit all. This necessitates the need for eclecticism\u2014to combine youth psychotherapies with other modes of treatments, such as medications, neuromodulation interventions, and Yoga and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Future practice for treatment of mental health conditions in the youth will likely adapt to this huge need for development of eclectic modalities and also reflect cost effectiveness and cultural sensitivity to an increasingly diverse population.",

      "abstract": "Educating a nation is crucial for the development of society in the developing world. This study used a crosssectional survey design, employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were collected and processed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 22.0). The data were coded, entered into a computer, and summarized using frequency tables to identify errors and make necessary edits. The study included a total of 208 participants, with the findings presented as percentages. The study revealed that the number of female teachers was lower compared to male teachers, with females accounting for 45% and males for 55%. This disparity was attributed to the fact that many schools in villages had fewer female teachers, who often had spouses or lived separately in towns, resulting in limited teaching availability. Additionally, 43.4% of respondents had been in the same school for 4-7 years, while 26.6% had been in the same school for at least 10 years, suggesting a potential repetition of experiences year after year. Furthermore, 16.6% of teachers were separated and 20% were single, which could potentially interfere with their duties and impact student performance. Among the respondents, 8.4% were widowed and 5% had divorced, indicating that they had to handle everything on their own, potentially leading to less focus on their assigned duties in the classroom and resulting in poor student performance. Additionally, 50% of respondents were married, although some were not located in the same workplace as their spouses, making it challenging to concentrate on school assignments. The study emphasized the importance of equipping head teachers with leadership knowledge and skills in order to exert influence on their schools and academic work.

      "abstract": "Abstract:Apart from her much-discussed role in the personal and professional relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Sabina Spielrein is widely known for her 1912 paper, \u201cDestruction as the Cause of Becoming,\u201d in which she posits the existence of an instinct of destruction, seen by many as a precursor of Freud\u2019s death drive. Despite recent attempts to assess the differences between Spielrein\u2019s, Jung\u2019s, and Freud\u2019s drive theories, few scholars have noted that these psychoanalysts\u2019 conceptions of drives were inherently related to their political views, specifically to their perception of social and evolutional progress. A common universal narrative that appears in the work of all three analysts is the view that human society develops from egoism to altruism. While, in Jung\u2019s work, this teleology also led to the association between non-industrial societies and a lower degree of development, Spielrein was more careful about the appropriation of such socio-evolutional hierarchies. This paper will explore not only her personal reasons for this caution, but also Spielrein\u2019s, Freud\u2019s, and Jung\u2019s differing perception of the social role of community and individuality.",

      "abstract": "Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. The concept of sustainable development has been widely studied by many scholars. The report \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d (1972) by Donella and Dennis Meadows, J\u00f8rgen Randers, and William Behrens first emphasized the planet's limited resources. E. F. Schumacher in \u201cSmall Is Beautiful\u201d (1973) proposed a human-centered approach to economics, while Alvin Toffler in \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d (1980) examined society\u2019s adaptation to rapid changes. The Brundtland Report \u201cOur Common Future\u201d (1987) established the notion of sustainable development at the international level. R. Costanza, H. Daly, and J. Lovelock highlighted ecological economics and resource conservation, while Z. Hull and H. Jonas explored ethical responsibility towards future generations. A. Papuzi\u0144ski systematized the philosophical paradigms of sustainable development, identifying pragmatic, conservative, and systemic approaches. A. Fergus, J. Rowney, J. Habermas, and M. Foucault emphasized the importance of discourse in sustainable development. Contributions by G. Nersesyan and S. Gordidzhin focus on the regulation of corporate social responsibility.\nThe research objective. To examine the evolution of the concept of sustainable development from a philosophical perspective, particularly its socio-philosophical aspects, and to determine their significance for ensuring the harmonious development of society.\nThe statement of basic materials. The evolution of the concept of sustainable development is examined from its historical origins to modern paradigms. The impact of global crises on achieving sustainable development goals and the integration of environmental, economic, and social dimensions into decision-making processes is analyzed. Special attention is given to corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an ethical component of business and its role in sustainable development.",

      "abstract": "In this article, I examine the relationship between the fall of Kemalism and the rise of critical thinking about Orientalism and Eurocentrism after the 1980s in T\u00fcrkiye. I argue that this critical thinking along with the development of a postcolonial perspective has had a substantial impact on the questioning of fundamental Kemalist ideas. The main assertions of Kemalism are westernization, laicite, and the construction of a historical narrative on pre-Islamic Turkishness that ignores the Seljuk and Ottoman periods. In this sense, the critical approaches and post-colonial studies have primarily challenged the most vital tenet of Kemalism, which is the reduction of modernity exclusively to the western experience. The critique has demonstrated the possibility of non-western modernities, and the importance of non-western agency in the formation of their peculiarities. By questioning total westernization and challenging the idea that modernity is identical to western experience, it has led to the weakening of Kemalist laicite and historiography; consequently, two significant events have taken place. These are the emergence of \u201ccivil\u201d Kemalism and the rise of Islamism. These two events have made visible the contingent and political nature of Kemalism, thus undermining its claim as a \u201cscientific, neutral and objective\u201d project.",

      "abstract": "In light of the postcolonial critique of Eurocentrism, the epistemological foundations of sociology and the legacies of classical sociologists have certainly become controversial. Postcolonial critiques of sociology\u2019s Eurocentrism have denounced the \u201cparochial\u201d nature and limitations of the theoretical contributions left by Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, the reductive and stereotyping orientation of the \u201cprimitivist\u201d and/or \u201corientalist\u201d representations of non-Western peoples that can be identified in their work, and the incomplete and misleading accounts of the Western processes of modernization that we have inherited from them, which fail to fully address and satisfactorily account for the realities of modern Western forms of colonialism and imperialism. However, the nature and consequences of Durkheim\u2019s specific sociological Eurocentrism raise opposing views within postcolonialism. This article aims to evaluate the pertinence of the divergent and sometimes contradictory postcolonial appraisals of Durkheim\u2019s Eurocentrism by focusing particularly on the controversies generated by his sociological approach to religion. Placing Durkheim\u2019s sociological project within both the academic field and the socio-political context in which it took shape, this article highlights the shifting relevance and the implications of his evolving sociological approach to this object of study in his science of morals. Although it is not exempt from inconsistencies and Eurocentric assumptions, Durkheim\u2019s sociological approach to religion leaves an invaluable legacy for a non-dualistic sociological understanding of the rituals through which humans (re)create their social identities and their forms of belonging and solidarity. In line with the priorities of some postcolonial agendas, it can fully reveal its explanatory potential in the sociological investigation of modern and contemporary interethnic and racial conflicts and forms of colonialism and neo-colonialism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:This article first offers a postcolonial critique on Japanese colonial historiography and post-1945 South Korean historiography on Confucian tradition of Korea that they both have shared a very essentialized understanding on Confucian tradition of Korea as unique nature of Korean society based on the same overarching evolutionary modernization narrative in spite of their contradictingly different definition of it as either premodern backwardness or Confucian modernity. In order to go beyond these still dominant essentialized bipolar views on Confucian tradition of Korea, based on a transnational perspective, this paper seeks to show how post-1945 South Korean historiography has redefined Confucian tradition of Korea. Then, to do so, this paper tries to historicize post-1945 South Korean historiography's appropriation of Max Weber's bureaucracy and modernization theories from U.S. academia of social science and East Asian studies for its studies of Kory\u014f-Chos\u014fn civil service examination and social status system. Then, this paper goes further to look at how post-1945 South Korean historiography on late Kory\u014f and early Chos\u014fn history has struggled from 1945 to early 2000 to redefine and reinvent Confucian tradition of Korea such as Kory\u014f-Chos\u014fn civil service examination as the unique origin of its own meritocratic modernity that is as close as \"Western Modernity,\" based on this appropriation of Max Weber's bureaucracy and modernization theories. Then, this paper finally turns to rethink the meaning of this appropriation within the broader context of Cold War and South Korean postcoloniality.",

      "abstract": "aware of this (as was Ali Shariati later as an intellectual in exile who prepared the way for the 1979 revolution). Further research into this stereotyping Orientalist ideology could further illuminate how Western imperial powers have for generations been evoking revolutionary movements among supposedly \u201cbackward\u201d peoples, particularly among Shi\u2019ite and Sunni Muslims in Iran, Iraq, Egypt, etc. Are scholars of the \u201cMiddle East\u201d investigating the ways in which the intensification of Orientalism, for example, in Samuel P. Huntington\u2019s \u201cClash of Civilization\u201d ideology, has been generating further ferment in majority Muslim countries? The revolutionary ideology and movements that came together in the Constitutional Revolution did not simply subside and disappear after the Pahlavi regime consolidated its power in Iran. Aslan\u2019s book offers a lively sketch of the players in that coalition whose continuing operation or transformation could be traced toward their reemergence in the 1950s and early 1960s as a new elected parliament that, under the leadership of Mohammad Mosadegh, boldly nationalized oil reserves and oil\u2013production in 1963. This led to the CIA overthrow of Mossadegh and the new parliamentary government and the consolidation of power by the Shah sponsored by the US government. This government replaced British imperial control of Iran with systematic suppression of a burgeoning civil society that had enabled the reemergence of a nascent democracy. An elementary knowledge of Shi\u2019a Islam enables the recognition that the US stumbled right into the role of the oppressive Yazid and even became the embodiment of the \u201cGreat Satan.\u201d Now that Iranians are again protesting tyrannical suppression of their rights, in this case by an oppressive Shi\u2019ite hierocracy, it would be helpful to understand the various oppositional groups and forces in Iran, including strands of Shi\u2019ite Islam other than the currently entrenched \u201cSupreme Leadership.\u201d",

However, this does not mean we need to discontinue dialog with Western thought. Rather it means retrieving and reviving our own intellectual heritage and being able to think with the categories and concepts derived from that heritage. But in light of the postcolonial situation where the intellectual and linguistic connection with one's own tradition is severed, this is a tremendous challenge. What is more, many Muslim intellectuals simply think that Islamic heritage has little relevance to address contemporary challenges. Yet unless Muslims are able to ground their self\u2010identity in their own intellectual tradition, they will be held captive to the web of epistemic colonialism. They might be comfortable offering their prayers as Muslims, but their mental ambience will be permeated by devastating, Eurocentric ideas. They will hardly be able to overcome their fragmented self\u2010image.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Claims regarding Western neo-colonial domination over scholarship in Comparative and International Education (CIE) have recently commanded much attention \u2013 for example in a 2017 special issue of the journal Comparative Education Review (CER) on the theme of \u2018contesting coloniality.\u2019 Stressing their marginal \u2018positionality,\u2019 the contributors to that special issue relate their critique to a narrative of \u2018epistemic violence\u2019 seen as underpinning \u2018Western\u2019 or \u2018Northern\u2019 hegemony in the CIE field and beyond. Adopting a historical perspective, I argue here that positing a dichotomy between a colonialist \u2018Western modernity\u2019 and a uniformly victimised \u2018non-West\u2019 is empirically unsustainable, and involves its advocates in propagating just the kind of essentialism and Eurocentrism that they condemn. I also argue that the centrality of \u2018positionality\u2019 and \u2018opacity\u2019 in postcolonialist or decolonial arguments, as expounded in the CER special issue, impedes meaningful and constructive scholarly dialogue. Scholarship in this vein threatens to divide the CIE field, undermine its wider credibility and distract from analysis of the pressing problems that confront us today. Comparativists need to balance critical scholarship concerning the implications of \u2018colonialism\u2019 with greater attention to the comparative study of its history.",

      "abstract": "Modernity is, for many (for Jurgen Habermas or Charles Taylor, for example), an essentially or exclusively European phenomenon. In these lectures, I will argue that modernity is, in fact, a European phenomenon, but one constituted in a dialectical relation with a non-European alterity that is its ultimate content. Modernity appears when Europe affirms itself as the \"center\" of a World History that it inaugurates; the \"periphery\" that surrounds this center is consequently part of its self-definition. The occlusion of this periphery (and of the role of Spain and Portugal in the formation of the modern world system from the late fifteenth to the mid-seventeenth centuries) leads the major contemporary thinkers of the \"center\" into a Eurocentric fallacy in their understanding of modernity. If their understanding of the genealogy of modernity is thus partial and provincial, their attempts at a critique or defense of it are likewise unilateral and, in part, false.",

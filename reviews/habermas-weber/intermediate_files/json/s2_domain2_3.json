      "abstract": "The concept of \u201cLebenswelt\u201d (the lifeworld) and the system are essential in J\u00fcrgen Habermas's thought. Habermas understands Lebenswelt as background knowledge that people take for granted naively. It becomes the horizon of their daily communication. He emphasizes the importance of coupling Lebenswelt and system. The uncoupling will make society get loss of meaning. Then we ask how he understands the position of religion in public life. How should we place religion as a part of Lebenswelt in making public law? To answer the question, we did the library research by exploring Habermas's works and his commentators. Then I conclude that Habermas offers accommodative participation to religion in public life through discourse. In the discourse, views inspired by religion can be put forward in the public sphere as far as they undergo a rationalization process. They should be openly discussed and tested instead of being taken for granted naively. Views inspired by religion will be accepted as long as they are rational. Discourse practice requires religious groups to be more mature and rational in formulating their ideas in the public sphere. Religious ideas are no longer positioned as closed and anti-criticism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this paper is to compare the theories of Yamazaki Masakazu und J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Yamazaki believed that the hard, ascetic individualism with a focus on production would alienate us from our humanity. He saw in a slowed down consumption a way out of this regressive development. Habermas on the other hand believed that system-oriented rationalization process would colonize the communication-oriented lifeworld. This negative trend could be overcome by developing a discourse free of power interference that enables consensus-building. This gentle individualism of Yamazaki and Habermas corresponds to a compromise between the extremes of a hard individualism (capitalism) and collectivism (communism or nationalism). The surprising result of the analysis is that Yamazaki\u2019s theory is not only easier to realize than Habermas\u2019s, but also more universally applicable.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Patient and public involvement in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is gaining increased interest among research and policy communities. Patients\u2019 organizations represent an important link between individual patients and the health system. Social theories are increasingly being used to explain doctor\u2013patient\u2013system interactions, expanding understanding beyond the mere clinical perspective. In this sense, patient involvement in HTA can also be considered through the Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action. From a Habermasian perspective, HTA as part of the instrumental rationality contributes to an increased efficiency of resource use within the system; however, such rationalization threatens to colonize the lifeworld by making it \u201cincreasingly state administered with attenuated possibilities for communicative action as a result of the commercialization and rationalization in terms of immediate returns.\u201d Using Habermasian system/lifeworld framework, this paper explores opportunities and obstacles to patient involvement in HTA, whereby trying to understand current and possible roles of patients\u2019 organizations as a mediating force between HTA as a function of the system and the lifeworld represented by patients.",

      "abstract": "\n For the Habermasian theory of the \u201cpublic sphere\u201d to make sense in the 2020s, it must be able to address the modern tendency toward global systemic crises. To examine the relevance of the Habermasian public sphere to today\u2019s deeply interconnected digital world, this article provides a selective reading of Habermas\u2019 writings on the public sphere, examining how he developed the concept from its conceptual core (1962) through his Legitimation Crisis (LC; 1973) and The Theory of Communicative Action (TCA; vol. 1 [1981] 1984, vol. 2 [1981] 1987). Working from the perspective of the \u201cdifferentiated lifeworld,\u201d we show here that the theory\u2019s background assumptions about reality (truth), solidarity (justice), personality (authenticity) are now being exposed and destabilized by current crisis tendencies and imaginaries. Here, we examine three exemplary (and interconnected) global disruptions that expose these assumptions: the climate crisis, the intensification of financial inequality in the Global North, and the rapid push toward datafication. Through our examination of whether the public sphere as Habermas conceived of it can exist in today\u2019s world, we provide a more expansive form of criticism of the public sphere (which is usually critiqued on the narrow grounds of the rational bias of communicative rationality). Here, we underscore the fundamental importance of addressing the complex system-lifeworld dynamics that are today re-conceptualizing and re-contextualizing the \u201cpublic sphere\u201d in this era of contemporary global crises.",

The focus was on the different phases in the project as well as the methodological challenges and opportunities that occurred in the user group sessions conducted.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis research adopt an explorative design studying a co-design process to develop an information and communication technology based support programme for and with CPwHF. Habermas\u2019 concepts of lifeworld and system are used as a theoretical framework to analyse the co-design process employed in the study.\n\n\nFindings\nReflecting on the co-design approach adopted, the findings highlight the methodological challenges that arise with carer involvement and the possible tensions that occur between researchers\u2019 ambitions to include users in the design process, and the goal of developing a product or service, in the different phases of the design process.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nFindings highlight that there is a tension between the system and lifeworld in the co-design process which are not totally compatible. The paper highlights that there is a need to develop flexible and reflexive human-centred design methodologies, able to meet carers\u2019 needs and ideas, and at the same time balance this with proposed research outcomes.\n",

      "abstract": "This study aims to examine the transformation of Royongan Omah, a communal house-building tradition in Ngasinan Village, amid modernization and socio-economic changes. Traditionally, community participation in this practice was rooted in voluntary collective labor, driven by social solidarity and mutual aid. However, over time, participation has become increasingly selective and economically motivated. Employing a qualitative case study approach, this research collected data through passive participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis, which were analyzed using Miles and Huberman\u2019s framework within Max Weber\u2019s social action theory. The findings indicate that rationalization and shifting economic perspectives have significantly reshaped community participation in Royongan Omah. While participation was previously dominated by traditional, affective, and value-rational actions, it has now transitioned towards value-rational and instrumental-rational actions. Full community engagement\u2014including labor, cognitive involvement, and material contributions\u2014has declined, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that prioritizes skilled, paid labor for complex construction tasks. Despite the growing dominance of instrumental rationality, elements of traditional and affective rationality persist, demonstrating an ongoing negotiation between modern efficiency and cultural heritage. This study contributes to sociological discourse on modernization and cultural adaptation, highlighting how traditional cooperative labor systems evolve in response to socio-economic transformations.",

The impact of BIM on users in their lifeworlds is explored using the concepts of Heidegger, Habermas, and Ihde from the perspective of technical mediation. This impact is explored by a case study. BIM mediates and shapes the relationship between users and their lifeworlds and can be characterized as either a hermeneutic or an alterity relationship. BIM conflicts with existing work practices in a ready-to-hand work environment. For users that cannot work with BIM, the work environment remains present-at-hand. The many heterogeneous BIM applications and systems used by the various parties involved result in interoperability problems that are a major barrier to enframing the supply chain by BIM. Although invitation and inhibition of certain actions by BIM may stimulate the rationalization of the lifeworlds, the lack of intrinsic motivation and mutual background knowledge inhibits an alignment of BIM and working practices.",

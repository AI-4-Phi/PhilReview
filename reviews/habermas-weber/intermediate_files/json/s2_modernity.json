      "abstract": "the standardisation of religion along neoliberal or consumerist lines. The post-secular is becoming a neoliberal post-secular, as the title suggests. The arguments that Possamai presents are thus, on the whole, fairly pessimistic. The i-zation of society signals the inexorable progress of the \u2018iron cage\u2019 and religion today, no more than in Weber\u2019s time, is offering effective resistance or a hopeful alternative. Nonetheless, throughout the presentation and then in focused fashion in the last section, the author tries to offer some hope and from time to time he muses that this i-zation may not be all bad. The prime way that he translates this hopeful pessimism is to suggest what he styles as a possible small step that global religion can take to mitigate at least the worst effects of the neoliberal regime, namely its generation of severely exacerbated and increasing global inequality. Here enters what the author offers as a \u2018global compassionate tax\u2019\u2014the idea that religions (apparently through their institutionalised forms) turn their generally tax exempt status around and voluntarily, cooperatively, transnationally, and outside formal state structures generate a vast fund, a kind of super-faith-based enterprise for equality. In other words, religions should (or could) turn precisely their neoliberal and standardised alignment with neoliberalism to the advantage of those that the system so effectively marginalises. Overall, Possamai\u2019s analysis is well-presented, coherently and frequently convincingly argued, and above all interesting. It is a speculative and mostly theoretical enterprise that illustrates its arguments very well, even though, of course, illustration is not the same as proof. It makes a solid contribution to what is indeed a much larger and very much an ongoing discussion. However, the reader does have to accept, if only provisionally, the theoretical and normative analyses of the main theoretical framers\u2014Weber, Jameson, Ritzer, and Habermas \u2014as presented by the author. And this reviewer admits that he does have a little bit of trouble doing that. However, this is a book to be recommended, if only to let an important debate continue.",

      "abstract": "N, Keith.\u00a0Under Weber\u2019s Shadow: Modernity, Subjectivity and Politics in Habermas, Arendt and Macintyre. Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "'Stakeholder' has become the primary category of political actor in decision-making, not least within nature conservation. Drawing from Habermas' theory on communicative action, this article argues that there are democratic deficits to the stakeholder model that promote citizens to remain locked in predetermined, polarized positions. It contends that the stakeholder model must, hence, be scrutinized with respect to its potential role in perpetuating conservation conflicts in modernity. Using the case study of stakeholder-based game management delegations (GMDs) in Sweden, our research identifies four barriers, which tie to the instrumental basis and liberal democratic legacy of the stakeholder approach: 1) strong sense of accountability; 2) overly purposive atmosphere; 3) overemphasis on decision as final outcome; and 4) perceived inability on the part of the delegates to influence science-led decision-making. The article suggests that these democratic deficits preclude the deliberation and contestation necessary to legitimate conservation policy. Indeed, stakeholder rationality causes citizens to become inert, instrumental agents who approach discussion with strategic rather than communicative rationality. We conclude that the deficits of the stakeholder model currently: 1) restrict democratic freedom for citizens; 2) engender a crisis of legitimacy of management; and 3) reproduce the conflict, which in Sweden relates to the conservation of wolves.",

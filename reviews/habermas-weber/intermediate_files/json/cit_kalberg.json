In contrast, actions driven by substantive rationality reflect deeply held values such as love or friendship. In cases where the trappings of formal rationality take on substantive value over and above their known direct contribution to achieving desired ends (e.g. in education testing), we observe means\u2013ends decoupling. Similarly, when substantive values in the environment (e.g. protecting the natural world or human rights) emerge in formally rational organizations, the clear link between means and ends becomes blurred. Below, we flesh out our conception of means\u2013ends decoupling and then discuss three consequences for organizations\u2014greater internal complexity, endemic reform, and the diversion of resources. We believe that instances of means\u2013ends decoupling are on the rise in the contemporary world. Conversely, instances of policy\u2013practice decoupling may become less common. In a rationalizing world, with heightened emphasis on transparency and accountability, policy\u2013practice decoupling is increasingly likely to be seen as a moral and operational failure, in contrast to early conceptual depictions that emphasized the legitimacy benefits of decoupling. Although it is largely overlooked, Meyer and Rowan\u2019s (1977) classic theorization was not limited just to policy\u2013practice decoupling.",

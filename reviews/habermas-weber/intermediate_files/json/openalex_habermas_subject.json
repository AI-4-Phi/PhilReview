      "abstract": "abstract Scholars in management and economics widely share the assumption that business firms focus on profits only, while it is the task of the state system to provide public goods. In this view business firms are conceived of as economic actors, and governments and their state agencies are considered the only political actors. We suggest that, under the conditions of globalization, the strict division of labour between private business and nation\u2010state governance does not hold any more. Many business firms have started to assume social and political responsibilities that go beyond legal requirements and fill the regulatory vacuum in global governance. Our review of the literature shows that there are a growing number of publications from various disciplines that propose a politicized concept of corporate social responsibility. We consider the implications of this new perspective for theorizing about the business firm, governance, and democracy.",

Obwohl die Autorin mit diesen Zugangsweisen insofern \u00fcbereinstimmt, als sie es ebenfalls f\u00fcr notwendig erachtet, eine weitreichendere Konzeption von Demokratie als jene die durch das 'aggregative' Modell bereitgestellt wird, zu entwickeln, gibt sie zu bedenken, da\u00df diese Konzepte nicht im Stande sind, ein angemessenes Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die Hauptaufgabe der Demokratie zu vermitteln. Indem Anh\u00e4nger des Konzepts der 'deliberativen Demokratie' festhalten, da\u00df Demokratie nicht auf Verfahrensfragen zur Vermittlung von entgegengesetzten Interessen reduziert werden kann, verteidigen sie zwar zweifelsohne eine Auffassungsweise der Demokratie, die eine weitreichendere Konzeption von Politik beinhaltet. Ihre Zugangsweise ist jedoch sehr wohl - wenn auch in einer anderen Form als jene Herangehensweise an der sie Kritik \u00fcben - auch rational, wonach die wesentliche Rolle die 'Leidenschaft' und kollektive Formen der Identifikation im Bereich der Politik spielen, au\u00dfer Acht gelassen wird. In dem Bestreben die liberale Zugangsweise mit jener der demokratischen Herangehensweise zu vereinen, neigen die Vertreter des Ansatzes der 'deliberativen' Demokratie dazu, die Spannungen, die zwischen ihnen existieren aufzul\u00f6sen und sind somit nicht in der Lage, das konfliktreiche Wesen der demokratischen Politik zu bew\u00e4ltigen. Die Haupthese, die die Autorin in diesem Artikel vertritt, geht davon aus, da\u00df demokratische Theorie die Un\u00fcberwindbarkeit von gewissen Antagonismen zu ber\u00fccksichtigen hat. Sie vertritt die Meinung, da\u00df ein Demokratiemodell in der Auspr\u00e4gung des 'agonistic pluralism' dazu beitragen kann, die wesentliche Herausforderung mit der sich demokratische Politik derzeit konfrontiert sieht, besser zu bew\u00e4ltigen: demokratische Formen der Identifikation zu schaffen, die dazu f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen, Kr\u00e4fte und 'Passionen' f\u00fcr demokratische Modelle zu mobilisieren.'

      "abstract": "Abstract Critical social theories look critically at the ways in which particular social arrangements hinder human flourishing, with a view to bringing about social change for the better. In this they are guided by the idea of a good society in which the identified social impediments to human flourishing would once and for all have been removed. The question of how these guiding ideas of the good life can be justified as valid across socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs is the most fundamental difficulty facing critical social theories today. This problem of justification, which can be traced back to certain key shifts in the modern Western social imaginary, calls on contemporary theories to negotiate the tensions between the idea of context\u2010transcendent validity and their own anti\u2010authoritarian impulses. Habermas makes an important contribution towards resolving the problem, but takes a number of wrong turnings. Keywords: Critical theorynon\u2010authoritarian theoryautonomyHabermasformal pragmaticsHabermas's theory of justice Notes 1 In situating critical social theory within the modern Western social imaginary, I do not wish to imply that this form of modernity is in any sense superior to other forms. I follow S. N. Eisenstadt in confining myself to the thesis that it is distinctive; I also follow Eisenstadt in recognizing 'the great variability of the symbolic, ideological and institutional responses to it [Western modernity], of the ways in which different civilizations and societies interpret different symbolic premises of modernity and different modern institutional patterns and dynamics'. S. N. Eisenstadt, 'Introduction', in S. N. Eisenstadt (ed.) Patterns of Modernity, Vol. 1: The West (London: Frances Pinter, 1987), pp. 1\u201311, here, p. 5. 2 Here I am guided by Cornelius Castoriadis's view that every society creates a social imaginary that determines society's values and the institutions that embody them. However, I use the term in a general way without committing myself to other aspects of Castoriadis's account of the social imaginary. See C. Castoriadis, The Imaginary Institution of Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987). My use of the term is closer to that of Charles Taylor. See C. Taylor, Modern Social Imaginaries (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2004). 3 A well\u2010known example here is Nietzsche, who challenged key elements of the modern world\u2010view, for example, the assumptions that human beings are equal and that historical time is progressive, and took on the task of reorienting our perceptions with regard to these. See F. Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans. T. Common (London: Allen and Unwin, 1967) and F. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, trans. R. J. Hollingdale (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1973). 4 R. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). 5 This is Robert Brandom's gloss on Rorty's utopian idea of unfettered imaginative activity in his 'Vocabularies of Pragmatism: Synthesizing Naturalism and Historicism', in R. Brandom (ed.) Rorty and his Critics (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), p. 179. Rorty claims to be in enthusiastic agreement with the sections of Brandom's essays from which this quotation is taken in his 'Response to Robert Brandom', in Rorty and his Critics, pp. 184 and 189. 6 See Butler's contributions to J. Butler, E. Laclau and S. \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality (London: Verso, 2000). 7 J. Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols. 1 and 2, trans. T. McCarthy (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1984 and 1987). 8 Examples here are A. Honneth, Struggle for Recognition, trans. J. Anderson (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995), J. Habermas, 'Individuation through Socialization: On George Herbert Mead's Theory of Subjectivity', in his Postmetaphysical Thinking, trans. W. M. Hohengarten (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), pp. 149\u2013204, and J. Habermas, 'Morality and Ethical Life: Does Hegel's Critique of Kant Apply to Discourse Ethics?', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, trans. C. Lenhardt and S. Weber Nicholsen (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), pp. 195\u2013215. 9 M. Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006). For an earlier effort in the same direction, see M. Cooke, 'A Space of One's Own: Autonomy, Privacy, Liberty', Philosophy and Social Criticism, 25 (1) (1999), pp. 23\u201353. 10 More precisely, the 'us' refers to 'us educated, sophisticated, tolerant, wet liberals, the people who are always willing to hear the other side, to think out all the implications, etc.' R. Rorty, 'Putnam and the Relativist Menace', Journal of Philosophy, 90 (9) (1993), 443\u201361, here, pp. 451\u20132. 11 For Butler, the normative and optimistic aspect of critical social thinking consists 'in the possibilities for expanding the key terms of liberalism, rendering them more inclusive, more dynamic and more concrete'. See J. Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', in Butler, Laclau and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 11\u201343, here, p. 13. Butler actually refers to 'the normative and optimistic moment' of hegemony; however, her formulation seems equally applicable to critical social thinking as she conceives it. 12 'Dogmatic' is used in the 'harmless sense' that for us, who have developed our identities within the socio\u2010cultural context of Western modernity, it cannot be circumvented. J. Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, trans. W. Rehg (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), pp. 445\u201356. 13 See J. Butler, 'Gender Trouble, Feminist Theory, and Psychoanalytic Discourse', in L. Nicholson (ed.) Feminism/Postmodernism (New York: Routledge, 1990), p. 324\u201340. In her most recent writings, however, there is some evidence that Butler is now less hostile to the notions of subjectivity with which the idea of autonomy is linked and may even be prepared to view autonomy as one of the key terms of liberal modernity that are open to creative rearticulation and re\u2010enactment. See J. Butler, Antigone's Claim: Kinship between Life and Death (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000) and J. Butler, Undoing Gender (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). 14 I outline the concept of autonomy that in my view best takes account of this intuition in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 15 Ferrara posits coherence and depth as two of the four normative requirements of authentic identity: A. Ferrara, Reflective Authenticity (London: Routledge, 1998). 16 Butler is likely to reject the very terms in which this disagreement is cast. Nor is it clear on which side of the divide she would position herself, even if she were to accept its terms. In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, I argue, nonetheless, that this is an issue of central concern to her theory and that a context\u2010transcending position would make best sense of her idea of universality as radical translation (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). 17 For Butler, all forms of identity \u2013 for example, the identity of individual subjects \u2013 are constituted differentially. That is, their constitution produces a constitutive outside that can never become fully inside or immanent. On the 'incompletion' of what she calls the subject position, see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', p. 12. 18 Butler, 'Dynamic Conclusions', in Butler, Laclan and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 263\u2013280, here, p. 268. 19 Habermas, who defends a context\u2010transcending position, accuses radically contextualist approaches such as Rorty's of collapsing the distinction between the strategic and non\u2010strategic uses of language. J. Habermas, 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn', in his On the Pragmatics of Communication, edited and with an introduction by M. Cooke (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), pp. 343\u201382. Rorty replies in his 'Response to Habermas', in Brandom, Rorty and his Critics, p. 58. 20 These objections to a radically contextualist critical approach are tailored to discursive \u2013 argumentation\u2010based \u2013 models of social criticism. However, as I point out in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, there are equivalent objections to non\u2010argumentative models of social criticism. 21 Other contemporary thinkers who explicitly endorse a context\u2010transcending approach include Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser. See their respective contributions in N. Fraser and A. Honneth, Redistribution or Recognition? A Political\u2010Philosophical Exchange (London: Verso, 2003). 22 The term Habermas uses to describe what I call the anti\u2010authoritarian impulse of contemporary critical social theory is 'post\u2010metaphysical'. See Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking. For a brief account of the postmetaphysical character of Habermas's idea of communicative rationality see M. Cooke, Language and Reason (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1994), pp. 38\u201343. As I point out below, Habermas's postmetaphysical approach goes beyond anti\u2010authoritarian approaches by leaving no room for the postulate of a transcendent \u2013 metaphysical \u2013 object. 23 Axel Honneth uses the term 'Left\u2010Hegelian' to describe the tradition of critical social thinking out of which the critical theory of the Frankfurt School emerges. The term has the advantage that it makes explicit the Frankfurt School's concern to rearticulate the critical social thinking of Hegel, as interpreted above all by Marx and Luk\u00e1cs. See A. Honneth, 'Eine Soziale Pathologie der Vernunft. Zur intellektuellen Erbschaft der Kritischen Theorie', in C. Halbig and M. Quante (eds), Sozialphilosophie zwischen Kritik und Anerkennung (M\u00fcnster, Hamburg, Berlin, Wien, London: LIT Verlag, 2003). 24 Cf. A. Honneth, 'The Social Dynamics of Disrespect: On the Location of Critical Theory Today', Constellations, 1 (2) (1994), pp. 255\u201369. 25 M. Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, The Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. J. Cumming (London: Allen Lane, 1973). 26 Evidently, it also gives rise to a problem of motivation since the authors eliminate the possibility of any kind of human reflection on, or conscious human resistance to, the oppressive, dehumanizing effects of twentieth\u2010century capitalism. 27 Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols 1 and 2. 28 J. Habermas, 'What is Universal Pragmatics?', in Habermas, On the Pragmatics of Communication, pp. 21\u2013103. See also Cooke, Language and Reason. It should be noted that Habermas sees reconstructive theories as dependent on indirect validation by other theories. See J. Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 116\u201394, here, pp. 116\u201318. 29 Habermas's clearest statement of the role which formal pragmatics plays in justifying his theory of communicative action can be found his writings on discourse ethics. See J. Habermas, 'Discourse Ethics: Notes on A Program of Philosophical Justification', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 42\u2013115 (esp. pp. 82\u201398). Here, the universalist character of his formal\u2010pragmatic hypotheses is evident, for example, when he states that 'the principle of universalization [\u2026] is implied by the presuppositions of argumentation in general' (p.86, my italics). To be sure, it is not clear how exactly this statement is to be understood. On occasion, he suggests that certain of the strong idealizations on which his theory depends are the result of socio\u2010cultural learning processes; these learning processes, which come about for historically contingent reasons, can be seen as developing the inherent logic of normative intuitions that are features of communication in all socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs. However, this qualification merely increases his burden of proof, for he now has to show not only that the normative intuitions in question are a feature of communication in general but also that there is an inherent logic to their development along the reflexive and universalist lines he describes. In his writings of the 1970s and 1980s Habermas held the view that reconstructive theories of individual moral development of the kind proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg could help him in this regard, while acknowledging that the difficulties involved in developing any such theory on a socio\u2010cultural level were considerable (see J. Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society, trans. T. McCarthy (London: Heinemann, 1979) and Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'). Since then, however, he has made no attempt to develop the required theory of socio\u2010cultural learning and has, moreover, expressed reservations about a number of fundamental aspects of Kohlberg's theory (see J. Habermas, 'A Philosophico\u2010Political Profile', in his Autonomy and Solidarity, ed. Peter Dews (London: Verso, 1986), pp. 149\u201389, here, p. 168 and J. Habermas, 'Lawrence Kohlberg and Neo\u2010Aristotelianism', in his Justification and Application: Remarks on Discourse Ethics, trans. C. Cronin (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993), pp. 113\u201332). For these reasons, I leave aside this complication in the following. 30 Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 29\u201338. To be sure, this constitutes an objection to his theory only in the absence of a theory of socio\u2010cultural learning that would show the idealizations in question to be the logical necessary development of normative intuitions that are features of communicative practices in general (see n. 29 above). 31 Seyla Benhabib makes this point with regard to the idealizing suppositions guiding moral argumentation in her Situating the Self (New York: Routledge, 1992), pp. 29\u201332. Cf. Cooke, Language and Reason, pp. 31\u20134. 32 See Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 150\u201362. 33 See Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, p. 109. Here he explicitly endorses the formal\u2010pragmatic justification of the moral principle of universalizability that he conducted in his earlier work. 34 In his writings subsequent to The Theory of Communicative Action there is some evidence that Habermas is prepared to accept that formal pragmatics provides only limited support for his concept of communicative rationality. Although he continues to affirm the importance of formal pragmatics as a justificatory strategy, on occasion he seems willing to admit that, on its own, formal pragmatics, cannot justify the emancipatory perspective offered by his critical social theory. See, for example, J. Habermas, 'A Genealogical Analysis of the Cognitive Content of Morality', in his The Inclusion of the Other, ed. C. Cronin and P. de Greiff (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000), pp. 3\u201346, here, p. 45. Furthermore, I discern evidence of an implicit acknowledgment of the limited justificatory power of formal pragmatics in Habermas's recent metatheoretical writings, in particular in the 'weak' naturalist argument he outlines in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1999), pp. 27\u201340. This argument aims to shed light on the question of how we can uphold a conception of objectivity notwithstanding the multiplicity and contingency of world\u2010generating grammars. In the course of the argument Habermas acknowledges his theory's reliance on the assumption that human beings unavoidably conceive of the progress of history as the possibility of learning. I regard this acknowledgment as a definite step in the right direction. See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'Socio\u2010Cultural Learning as a \"Transcendental\" Fact: Habermas's Postmetaphysical Perspective', International Journal of Philosophical Studies, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 63\u201383 and M. Cooke, 'Between \"Objectivism\" and \"Contextualism\": the Normative Foundations of Social Philosophy', Critical Horizons, 1 (2) (2000), pp. 193\u2013227. 35 See especially Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, Chs 7 and 8. 36 See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism: Habermas's Conception of Justice', European Journal of Political Theory, 2 (3) (2003), pp. 298\u2013300. 37 J. Rawls, Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993). It is noteworthy that Habermas criticizes (what I call) the radically contextualist aspect of Rawls's theory. See J. Habermas, 'Reconciliation through the Public Use of Reason: Remarks on John Rawls's Political Liberalism', Journal of Philosophy, 92 (3) (1995), pp. 109\u201331. Reprinted in Habermas, The Inclusion of the Other, pp. 49\u201373. 38 See nn 30 and 29 above. 39 Benhabib makes a similar point in her Situating the Self, p. 32. Indeed, the justificatory strategy I propose is similar to Benhabib's in a number of respects. The differences between our positions have to do with my proposed conceptualization of the idea of context\u2010transcending validity that is operative in argumentation. In M. Cooke, 'Habermas and Consensus', European Journal of Philosophy, 1 (3) (1993), pp. 247\u201367, I argue that this aspect of Benhabib's theory is underdeveloped. In Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 7, I make some concrete suggestions as to how it should be developed. 40 I develop it further in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 41 I develop it further ibid., Chs 1 and 2. 42 I discuss his theory of truth in some detail in M. Cooke, 'Habermas on Meaning and Truth', European Journal of Philosophy, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 1\u201323, in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism' and in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 5. 43 Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking, p. 8. 44 Ibid., p. 139. 45 It has been criticized, for example, for its restriction of moral discourse to discussion from the standpoint of the 'generalized other', neglecting the standpoint of the 'concrete other' (in Benhabib, Situating the Self, pp. 340\u20132); for its proposal that the idea of an agreement reached in an idealized process of moral discourse can be used as a standard for testing the validity of actual moral norms and principles (in A. Wellmer, 'Ethics and Dialogue', in his The Persistence of Modernity, trans. D. Midgley (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 1991), pp. 113\u2013231 and in C. Lafont, 'Realismus und Konstruktivismus in der kantianischen Moralphilosophie \u2013 das Beispiel der Diskursethik', Deutsche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Philosophie, 50 (1) (2002), pp. 39\u201352); and for making moral insight dependent on the exchange of arguments in moral discourse (in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', pp. 294\u20138). 46 Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Chs 5, 6 and 7. 47 See J. Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 271\u2013317, esp. 296\u2013301. 48 See Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit'. 49 J. Habermas, 'Einf\u00fchrung: Realismus nach der pragmatischen Wende', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 7\u201364, here, pp. 56\u201357; see also 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', esp. pp. 293\u20135. The German word normally used by Habermas is unverf\u00fcgbar. 50 The main elements of Habermas's revised theory of truth are set out in his 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit' and in his 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn'. 51 Judith Butler gives examples of ways in which the concept of universality has been vigorously contested, resulting in creative new articulations and restagings of it (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). Similarly, the concept of autonomy has been the subject of vigorous contestation and rearticulation. Even the concept of contestability can be the object of socio\u2010cultural learning: Albrecht Wellmer, for example, suggests that the question of which 'truths' can be contested is itself a contested matter, suggesting the need to reconsider the concept of contestability itself (see A. Wellmer, Sprachphilosophie (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2004), pp. 250\u201377). 52 See Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', and Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Ch. 7. 53 K. Marx, 'Theses on Feuerbach', in D. McLellan (ed.) Karl Marx: Selected Writings (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 156\u20138. 54 However, in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I argue that a non\u2010authoritarian conception of theory calls on critical social theory to rearticulate the traditional Marxian notion of praxis. 55 In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I suggest that contemporary critical social theories are well advised to give up the aspiration of providing a 'grand explanation' of what is wrong with the existing social order and to concentrate, instead, on analysing how the impediments to human flourishing are reproduced and disseminated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract \"Public sphre\" is often used by historians of modern Latin America without much concern about its theoretical and methodological implications. Some historians have used it as a model to fit evidence about public debates and politics during the modern period, yet few have engaged it as a theory with deeper methodological and conceptual implications. This article will review the historical literature that has applied Habermas's ideas to Latin American history. Focusing on a few particularly important books, the article will examine potential avenues for research and comparisons. Rather than becoming a new orthodoxy for the study of the region, the theory of the public sphere is establishing a dialogue among historians interested in intellectual phenomena and political discourse (most of them centered on the history of liberalism after independence) and those historians whose interest in social formations have framed their study in terms of hegemony and class domination. The article will argue that a critical use of Habermas's ideas (one that is more systematic about the gender and class exclusions built into the bourgeois public sphere, and that problematizes the connections between the specific development of capitalism in peripheral regions and their embrace of European political traditions) could yield useful results in terms of new research and an inclusive synthesis of recent literature interested in politics, culture and hegemony in Latin America. Notes 1J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (Cambridge, MA, 1991). I am indebted to Tom Klubock, Thom Rath, Federico Sor and Mary Kay Vaughan for their comments on earlier drafts. This article was also discussed at the Columbia University's Department of History graduate faculty workshop and at the New School's workshop of Latin American Studies. I thank Karl Wennerlind, Herbert Sloan, Claudio Lomnitz and Paul Gootenberg for their comments. 2The danger, of course, is that of creating 'un Mapa del Imperio, que ten\u00eda el tama\u00f1o del imperio y coincid\u00eda puntualmente con \u00e9l'. 'El rigor de la ciencia' in Jorge Luis Borges, Obras completas II 1952\u20131972 (Barcelona, 1996). This map will have Mexico as the centre. It is a result of my background and I hope it can be excused as a geographical convention. 3See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures.

See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Discourse ethics: notes on a program of philosophical justification' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (Cambridge, 1990). For the normative implications of the public-sphere model, see Nancy Fraser, 'Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy', Social Text, nos 25/26 (1990). See also Thomas A. McCarthy, The Critical Theory of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, first MIT Press paperback edition (Cambridge, 1981), chap. 1; J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Ciencia y t\u00e9cnica como 'ideolog\u00eda' (Mexico City, 1993). Implicit in Habermas's idea of 'communicative rationality' is 'the central experience of the unconstrained, unifying, consensus-bringing force of argumentative speech': J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, vol. 1, Reason and the Rationalization of Society, trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston, 1984), 10. 5Arthur Strum, 'A bibliography on the concept of \u00d6ffentlichkeit', New German Critique, lxi (1994). Habermas refers to 'seminal theories', like those by Freud and Marx, that 'inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research' resulting in 'hybrid discourses' that may be criticized from the academic establishment but could generate 'new research traditions'. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Philosophy as stand-in and interpreter' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, op. cit., 15. 6The OED provides two examples of the term, both dated 1992. See entries for 'maternalize' and 'nonsensification', Oxford English Dictionary (available online at: http://www.oed.com/). For the parallel with Weber see Joan B. Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution (Ithaca, 1988), 10. 7Habermas links the public sphere with his theory of communicative action at a 'fundamental' level: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Further reflections on the public sphere', Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, 1997), 422, 41. Other scholars, mentioned below, have already suggested the need to confront analyses based on Gramsci and Habermas. 8Habermas's initial definition is tentative and contains the diversity of issues outlined above: 'The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labour. The medium of this political confrontation was peculiar and without historical precedent: people's public use of their reason.' See Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27. See also J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article', New German Critique, iii (1974). On the historical character of the definition, see Moishe Postone, 'Political theory and historical analysis' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit. 9James Van Horn Melton, The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe (New York, 2001), 10, 12. 10For similar agendas see E. P.

I owe this reference to Samuel Moyn. 14Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27, 55; Melton, The Rise, op. cit.; Daniel Gordon, 'Philosophy, sociology, and gender in the Enlightenment conception of public opinion', French Historical Studies, xvii, 4 (1992), 889, 901; Keith Michael Baker, 'Defining the public sphere in eighteenth-century France: variations on a theme by Habermas' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 202. 15Roger Chartier, The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution, trans.

A similar census would probably be impossible today. See also Peter Uwe Hohendahl, 'The public sphere: models and boundaries' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 108. For an example of these possibilities see Madeleine Hurd, Public Spheres, Public Mores, and Democracy: Hamburg and Stockholm, 1870\u20131914 (Ann Arbor, 2000). 17See a discussion of the implications of this from the point of view of Mexican history in Pablo Piccato, 'Introducci\u00f3n: \u00bfModelo para armar? Hacia un acercamiento cr\u00edtico a la teor\u00eda de la esfera p\u00fablica' in Cristina Sacrist\u00e1n and Pablo Piccato (eds), Actores, espacios y debates en la historia de la esfera p\u00fablica en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico (Mexico City, 2005).

After independence, 'Lo radicalmente nuevo es la creaci\u00f3n de una escena p\u00fablica': Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 13, 23, 87. This parallels Benedict Anderson's claim that 'the convergence of capitalism and print technology \u2026 created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation', and his focus on American Creole identities as early examples of this process. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (New York and London, 1983), 46. Concepts like el pueblo or lo p\u00fablico also had a history that illustrated the incorporation of traditional and modern notions, as explored by Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 'Reflexiones sobre la terminolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica del liberalismo' in Carlos Illades, Brian Connaughton and Sonia P\u00e9rez Toledo (eds), Construcci\u00f3n de la legitimidad pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico (Zamora, 1999). 20Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 30. See Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Penser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (Paris, 1978). For Palti, Guerra's use of Habermas lacked a 'strong' critique of the public-sphere model and failed to recognize Raymond Kosseleck's work as a necessary antecedent. Furet and Cochin were decisive in Guerra's work to strengthen that critique, without embracing 'las teor\u00edas multiculturalistas \"posmodernas\"'. El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 Palti, 'Guerra y Habermas: ilusiones y realidad de la esfera p\u00fablica Latinoamericana' in Erika Pani and Alicia Salmer\u00f3n (eds), Conceptualizar lo que se ve: Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Guerra historiador, homenaje (Mexico City, 2004), 466. 21See Dena Goodman, 'Public sphere and private life: toward a synthesis of current historiographical approaches to the Old Regime', History and Theory, xxxi, 1 (1992), 8, 12. Guerra's explicit rejection of Habermas's Marxism in Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 86n, 87, 14. For studies inspired by Guerra's insights and a closer connection to local contexts, see Francois-Xavier Guerra and Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (eds), Los espacios p\u00fablicos en Iberoam\u00e9rica: Ambig\u00fcedades y problemas: Siglos XVIII\u2013XIX (Mexico, 1999). For the public sphere as part of the politicization of new national societies, see Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez Bernaldo, 'Sociabilidad, espacio urbano y politizaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Buenos Aires (1820\u20131852)' in Hilda Sabato and Alberto Rodolfo Lettieri (eds), La vida pol\u00edtica en la Argentina del siglo XIX: armas, votos y voces (Buenos Aires, 2003), 199. 22Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 12, 101. Such characterization of the socio-economic impact and causes of the revolutions of independence is challenged in John Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750\u20131940 (Princeton, 1988); Eric Van Young, The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology, and the Mexican Struggle for Independence, 1810\u20131821 (Stanford, 2001). 23Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 17, 91, 234. The Habermasian focus on 'a new, autonomous, free, and sovereign public' implies a marked alternative from Furet's Tocquevillian emphasis on associations and modes of sociability as the base for a modern public opinion. Chartier, Cultural Origins, op. cit., 16\u201317. 24Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 52, 99. Guerra's emphasis on culture fits well with older visions of 'Latin American culture' as something clearly identifiable; for Edmundo O'Gorman, this common identity meant that the influence of the United States is negligible in the emergence of a Latin American political culture. Edmundo O'Gorman, 'Hegel y el moderno panamericanismo', Letras de M\u00e9xico, ii, 8 (1939). See Charles Hale, 'Edmundo O'Gorman y la historia nacional', Signos Hist\u00f3ricos, ii, 3 (2000), 17, 24. Absent is a problematization of neo-colonialism as an informal and subordinate mode of entering modernity. See Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi, The Contemporary History of Latin America, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1993). 25McEvoy, La utop\u00eda republicana, op. cit., 11. 26McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit. For similar insights, to be examined below, see \u00c1ngel Rama, The Lettered City, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1996). 27McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit. 28Rafael Rojas, La escritura de la independencia: El surgimiento de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en M\u00e9xico (Mexico City, 2003), 17, 34, 35, 62. 29 ibid., 35.

If in the end the new nations rejected liberal monarchism, explains Rojas, it was because of the revolutionary logic of insurgency and the consequent loyalist response, but not because of any inherently democratic feature of the new public sphere. Rojas, La escritura, op. cit., 49. 30Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguilar, 'Dos conceptos de rep\u00fablica' in Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguilar and Rafael Rojas (eds), El republicanismo en hispanoam\u00e9rica: Ensayos de historia intelectual y pol\u00edtica (Mexico City, 2002), 63. See McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit., 43. 31For the 'tradici\u00f3n republicana' as the centre of a long-term political history of Mexico that stresses local and corporative representation over democracy and equality, see Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez Ch\u00e1vez, La tradici\u00f3n republicana del buen gobierno (Mexico, 1993); Antonio Annino, 'Ciudadan\u00eda versus gobernabilidad republicana en M\u00e9xico: Los or\u00edgenes de un dilema' in Hilda S\u00e1bato (ed.), Ciudadan\u00eda pol\u00edtica y formaci\u00f3n de las naciones: Perspectivas hist\u00f3ricas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Mexico City, 1999).

The central issue is whether TNCs should provide global rules and guarantee individual citizenship rights, or instead focus on maximizing profits. First, we describe the problems arising from the globalization process that affect the relationship between public rules and private firms. Next we consider the position of economic and management theories in relation to the social responsibility of the firm. We argue that instrumental stakeholder theory and business and society research can only partially solve the global governance issue, and that more recent concepts of corporate citizenship and republican business ethics deliver theoretically and practically helpful, fresh insights. However, even these need further development, especially with regard to the legitimacy of corporate political activity.",

      "abstract": "Jurgen Habermas, a professor of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt, is Germany's most distinguished contemporary descendant of the Frankfurt School and among its most distinguished leftist intellectuals. Habermas has reconsidered his philosophical position during the course of his career. He has also reconsidered his politics. He has, however, never abandoned the pursuit of what Marx and the first members of the Frankfurt School had sought before him: a descriptive sociology with prescriptive force\u2014a unification of theory and practice. The early Habermas might accurately enough be characterized as a neo-Marxist, if a neo-Marxist who had learned much from Weber. The later Habermas is sometimes characterized as a neofunctionalist, sometimes as a neo-evolutionist. Whatever else he may or may not be, he is certainly a dedicated if discriminating synthesist of the philosophies and sociologies of both the more and the less recent past. In the 1970s, Habermas began to attend seriously to the Anglo-American philosophy of speech acts, to theories of learning, and to cybernetics. By the 1980s, he had assigned to elements of all of them a fundamental place in a formulation of reason or rationality centered not in Kant's transcendental subject but instead in communication and communicative intersubjectivity. Habermas's most sustained and detailed treatment of what he calls communicative reason is available in the two volumes of The Theory of Communicative Action, translated by T. McCarthy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1984\u20141987). The more summary treatment that follows is selected from The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity.",

      "abstract": "She referred to the high-rise as if it were some kind of huge animate presence, brooding over them and keeping a magisterial eye on the events taking place. There was something in this feeling \u2014 the elevators pumping up and down the long shafts resembled pistons in the chamber of a heart. The residents moving along the corridors were the cells in a network of arteries, the lights in their apartments the neurones of a brain (J.G. Ballard, 1975: 40). Now, the boundaries between the organic and the inorganic, blurred by cybernetic and bio-technologies, seem less sharp; the body, itself invaded and re-shaped by technology, invades and permeates the space outside, even as this space takes on dimensions that themselves confuse the inner and the outer, visually, mentally and physically (Anthony Vidler, 1990: 37\u20138). The body-territory [corpo-territorio] poses a problematic form of corporeal identity that in becoming ever more routinized has tended to dissolve the distinctions that formerly existed between the organic and the inorganic (Tiziana Villani, 1995: 118). As she tentatively begins to play the piano, the replicant, named Rachel, recalls that she once had lessons but cannot be sure whether these memories are her own or simply the implanted memories of someone else. In this poignant scene in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) we explore the possibility that human identities might be artificially created in order to produce advanced androids whose intelligence and sensitivity is comparable with that of their human creators. The figure of the cyborg, as represented in science fiction cinema, is not an automaton or robot but a sophisticated creation that seems to simultaneously extend but also threaten our understanding of what it means to be human. If we were to locate the cyborg as an idea, we could say that it is clearly linked to fantastical combinations of bodies and machines but is nonetheless a way of thinking about the world. It is, in other words, an ontological strategy for extending the limits to human knowledge as well as an apposite means of describing those phenomena that appear to reside outside conventional frameworks of understanding. If a cyborgian sensibility is explored within the context of the contemporary city, we find that it has developed out of several interconnecting strands of thought as a trope of critical reflection which uncovers a series of anomalies, fractures and tensions lurking within dominant modes of urban and architectural thinking. Since the early 1960s the potential applications of the cyborg concept have proliferated to include developments such as whole organism cloning, in vitro fertilization, gene sequencing, advanced prosthetics and other sophisticated medical technologies. In tandem with these technological manifestations, the imaginative field of the cyborg has expanded through literature, cinema and the fantasy spaces of contemporary culture.1 It is since the mid-1980s, however, that the idea of the cyborg has been associated with a more densely argued series of theoretical applications as a means to explore the interface between technology and the body. The key intervention here is Donna Haraway's article entitled 'A Cyborg Manifesto', first published in the Socialist Review in 1985, and later included in her influential collection of essays Simians, Cyborgs and Women where she writes in her introduction (1991a: 1): A cyborg is a hybrid creature, composed of organism and machine. But, cyborgs are compounded of special kinds of machines and special kinds of organisms appropriate to the late twentieth century. Cyborgs are post-Second World War hybrid entities made of, first, ourselves and other organic creatures in our unchosen \"high-technological\" guise as information systems, texts, and ergonomically controlled labouring, desiring, and reproducing systems. The second essential ingredient in cyborgs is machines in their guise, also, as communications systems, texts, and self-acting, ergonomically designed apparatuses. This succinct and revealing definition reminds us that the idea of the cyborg, as originally elaborated by Haraway, is at root a political as well as an intellectual project, an idea which originated in and from the 'belly of the monster' (1991a: 4), that nexus of political and economic entanglements that we might term the 'first world' in distinction to the proliferating spaces of marginality that lie beyond.2 Since its inception as a critical intellectual concept in the 1980s the cyborg metaphor has been deployed to challenge disembodied, dualistic, masculinist and teleological bodies of knowledge. It has infused science and technology studies with feminist epistemological strategies. It has opened up new possibilities for the understanding of relations between nature and culture. And it has facilitated greater sensitivity towards social and spatial complexity through its emphasis on 'situated knowledges'. The idea of the cyborg shares an affinity with related concepts such as 'cyberspace', 'cybernetics' and 'cyberpunk'. Yet the contemporary use of the term 'cyborg' is different from these virtual, analytical and fictional constructs because it is grounded in the living and breathing flesh of the human body. Whilst the 'cyber-' metaphor has tended to be associated with various forms of virtuality, the idea of the cyborg is closely linked with the corporeal experience of space.3 In this sense the cyborg can be read as an alternative way of conceptualizing the growth and development of cities that serves to destabilize the pervasive narratives of dematerialization, spatial malleability and virtualization. The underlying materiality of the cyborg metaphor has acquired heightened significance now that the earlier polarity between virtual space and 'meat space' articulated in the first wave of cyber literature is losing its conceptual utility and now that the very idea of 'virtual reality' is itself imploding as it becomes either relocated in the context of a heightened dimension of the real (see, for example, \u017di\u017eek, 2002) or simply derided as an inherently oxymoronic formulation (see Grosz, 2001).4 The emphasis of the cyborg on the material interface between the body and the city is perhaps most strikingly manifested in the physical infrastructure that links the human body to vast technological networks. If we understand the cyborg to be a cybernetic creation, a hybrid of machine and organism, then urban infrastructures can be conceptualized as a series of interconnecting life-support systems (see Swyngedouw, 1996; Marras, 1999; Gandy, 2002; Mitchell, 2003). The modern home, for example, has become a complex exoskeleton for the human body with its provision of water, warmth, light and other essential needs. The home can be conceived as 'prosthesis and prophylactic' in which modernist distinctions between nature and culture, and between the organic and the inorganic, become blurred (Vidler, 1990: 37). And beyond the boundaries of the home itself we find a vast interlinked system of networks, pipes and wires that enable the modern city to function. These interstitial spaces of connectivity within individual buildings extend through urban space to produce a multi-layered structure of extraordinary complexity and utility. The figure of the cyborg is at root a spatial metaphor. But how does the idea of the cyborg intersect with spatial theory? In what ways does the cyborg reinforce or contradict other emerging strands of urban thought that also emphasize urban complexity and hybridity? Has the epistemological subtlety and political prescience of the cyborg, as originally formulated in the 1980s, been realized in practice or simply been diffused through the term's widening usage? And should we ultimately reject the idea of the cyborg as an anachronism derived from cold war science and the first generation of twentieth-century cyberpunk culture? In the rest of this article I will try to address these issues through an exploration of the somewhat haphazard presence of the cyborg in contemporary urban discourse. I will focus in particular on the example of urban infrastructure as a concrete manifestation of the cyborg idea in order to explore different facets of the relationship between the city, the body and the human subject. My aim is not to foreclose discussions surrounding the 'cyborg city' but to open up a series of dialogues in order to explore contemporary thinking around these questions. One of the principal difficulties with delineating the cyborg city as a clearly defined entity is derived from the entanglement of the cyborg idea with a variety of urban metaphors ranging from organicist conceptions of the nineteenth-century city to 'neo-organicist' representations of the post-industrial metropolis. In its classic nineteenth-century form the organicist conception of the city emerged out of a functional analogy, originating within the medical sciences, wherein spatial differentiation corresponded with a distinctive arrangement of human organs. We find that Kantian notions of the self-organizational characteristics of animate matter were combined with new insights into the human vascular and arterial system and an emerging circulatory emphasis within the nascent science of political economy. In recent years, however, the organicist emphasis on the city as an integrated body with identifiable organs, which emerged in response to the nineteenth-century industrial city, has been increasingly displaced by the idea of urban space as a prosthetic extension to the human body. The body-city problematic has been reconceptualized in the context of post-Cartesian and post-positivist modes of thinking. The emphasis on the city as a self-contained body or machine has been challenged by a hybridized conception of space as a system of technological devices that enhances human productive and imaginative capabilities. The cyborg metaphor not only reworks the metabolic preoccupations of the nineteenth-century industrial city but also extends to a contemporary body of ideas that we can term 'neo-organicist' on account of the deployment of biophysical metaphors for the interpretation of social and spatial complexity. In the neo-organicist city we encounter a shift of emphasis away from an anatomical conception of space as an assemblage of individual organs towards a neurological reading of space as a diffuse and interconnected realm of human interaction. The film maker Michael Burke, for example, director of Cyborg City (1999), describes how beneath the 'glass and concrete' of the future city there will be a 'humming mass of technology' acting as a central nervous system, 'constantly monitoring and controlling both its own functions and those of its citizens' (Burke, 1998).5 The mechanical and hierarchical model of the relationship between the body and the city has been supplanted by a more complex and non-linear pattern of urban development in response to the spread of new information technologies (see Gille, 1986; Rabinbach, 1990; Akira, 2001). The organicist city of the modern era was founded on a clear separation between mind and body that enabled the city to be conceptualized as a coherent entity to be acted upon, disciplined, regulated and shaped according to human will. The emergence of the neo-organicist city, in contrast, is founded on the blurring of boundaries rather than their repeated delineation. At the same time, however, there remain important continuities between the kind of machine-based metaphors associated with the early twentieth-century futurism of figures such as Mario Chiattone, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Antoniono Sant'Elia and the elaborate computer-based metaphors deployed in the contemporary city (see Villani, 1995; Boyer, 1996; Schaub, 1998). Other significant continuities include, for example, the avant-garde bricolage of early cinema and the surrealist bodies depicted in the art of Hans Bellmer, Francis Picabia and other responses to 'a sterile and over rationalised technological realism' (Vidler, 1990: 42).6 These interconnecting strands between cultural modernism and the emergence of the cyborg metaphor are significant because they underlie the centrality of corporeal metaphors for the critical interpretation of urban form. The current emphasis on corporeal and neurological analogies in the neo-organicist literature owes more to earlier developments than is widely acknowledged. We can detect two principal dimensions to contemporary neo-organicist urban thought. A first strand, rooted in the bio-physical sciences, perceives the city to be a special kind of complex, yet intricately ordered system. This homeostatic perspective, which is inflected by ecological thinking and recent developments in evolutionary biology, has diffused through parts of the architectural literature and is only tangentially linked with the epistemological challenge of cyborg theory.7 A second and more intellectually significant development is represented by the convergence of ideas surrounding the 'thinking space' of the city and the indeterminacy of spatial forms. If the body-city nexus is conceptualized as a thinking machine then the analytical focus shifts towards the identification of those critical networks or 'neurones' that sustain the relationship between the body and the city (Kurokawa, 2001a). Though this dimension to the neo-organicist perspective shares important continuities with the technological preoccupations of early twentieth-century modernism, it extends its conceptual purview into different aspects of cultural modernism. The influential speculations of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, for example, develop Antonin Artaud's conception of the 'body without organs' to produce a philosophy of spatial complexity quite different from that associated with dominant modernist traditions (Deleuze and Guattari, 1986; 1987; Rajchman, 2000; Uno, 2001). Their philosophical challenge is to perceive space in the absence of any previously existent categories, hierarchies or systems as a form of 'anarchic non-identical proliferation' (Luckhurst, 1997: 128). The organic metaphor of the 'rhizome' is deployed in distinction to 'arborescent' conceptions of cities as hierarchical structures (Teysott, 1990; Akira, 2001; Kurokawa, 2001a). In addition to this emphasis on non-hierarchical structures of difference Deleuze and Guattari's conception of concrete space also seeks to incorporate the imaginary, libidinous and oneiric realms of human experience. From their 'neo-vitalist' perspective, which builds on the philosophical ideas of Henri Bergson, the virtual realm is not simply a mimesis or reflection of physical reality but an independent domain that generates new kinds of spaces and ideas. The political significance of the virtual realm lies in its experimental and emergent role as part of an envisioned space that has yet to be realized within the taken-for-granted realm of concrete reality (Boundas, 1996; Massumi, 2001). The role of the diagram or 'abstract machine' takes on special significance in this context as an attempt to give visual expression to new models of reality.8 In the case of architecture, for example, there has been an intense dialogue between developments in building design and the speculative possibilities engendered by computer-aided simulations so that 'physical space increasingly resembles cyberspace' (Mitchell, 2003: 197). Some architectural practices have deployed so-called 'genetic algorithms' in order to generate a form of 'in vitro' architecture which derives its inspiration from nature yet remains autonomous from it as a purely digitized space of imaginative exploration (see Chu, 2002; De Landa, 2002).9 Examples of architectural practice inflected by post-structuralist ideas which move beyond purely 'in vitro' speculations to fully realized projects include the work of Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry and Bernard Tschumi, where sophisticated combinations of form, structure and materials have been achieved, which are quite at odds with modernist conceptions of architectural form. A conceptual synthesis can be discerned in some of the recent literature between post-structuralist philosophies of space and Latourian conceptions of actor-network theory to produce a new kind of urban theorization which eschews the meta-narratives associated with neo-Marxian approaches. Building on the insights of Deleuze and Guattari these approaches have sought to remove all the extrinsic or foundational aspects to urban theory and pare analysis down to the movements and interactions that constitute 'the city' as a particular kind of spatial form or activity that is independent of conventional accounts of scale, structure or order.10 The brain or 'thinking space' of the city persists yet is dispersed through innumerable nodes and networks in contrast with the embodied cyborg citizen to be found in the more technophile literature. We can trace these developments back to the emerging critique of architectural modernism in the 1970s and 1980s that increasingly drew on the theoretical ontologies of post-structuralism in order to advance a radically unplanned built form.11 From this perspective the role of 'chaos', for example, takes on a very different significance from that associated with the modernist city and is perceived as a field of evolutionary and radical experimentation. Chaos is no longer seen as an anomalous dimension to the urban experience to be problematized or excluded from analysis but a rich vein of social and spatial interaction through which we may perceive signs of alternative or hitherto overlooked urban forms. Chaos may also be characterized as a more sophisticated, resilient and adaptable form of order as Rem Koolhaas has suggested with respect to the dynamics of West African urbanism (Koolhaas et al., 2001; Koolhaas, 2002). The theoretical novelty of such a perspective sits sharply at odds, however, with the capacity for what one might term 'avant-garde urbanism' to actually explicate any substantial dimensions to urban change (see, for example, Rauterberg, 2002; Gandy, 2004b). We can detect within urban and architectural discourse an emerging counter current to post-structuralist and avant-garde urbanism led by a of and political (see 1996; and 1998). Though the post-structuralism of Deleuze and Guattari seeks to between the and the and is in this respect a significant advance on the and of there is a in any kind of political critique of the cyborg The emphasis on the characteristics of urban space the particular combinations of and human that enable nodes within the urban system to play in the of cultural and economic The of structure the of the theoretical and significance of these insights the between post-structuralism and a cyborg sensibility towards the entanglement of the real and the We are with an between the reading of the industrial city and a 'neo-organicist' with the design of space that quite in architectural The emerging of the interface as a technological is associated with nineteenth-century over science and technology, for example, form part of a counter discourse to modernist of technological 1996; 2003).

Kelty investigates the history and cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and practices that have transformed not only software but also music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software source code that is made openly and freely available through an unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by demonstrating how Free Software is a \"recursive public\" - a public organized around the ability to build, modify, and maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first place.",

Habermas' motivating insight is that neither a transcendental nor a metaphysical solution to the problem of normativity, nor a merely hermeneutic reconstruction of historically given norms, is sufficient to clarify the normative foundations of critical theory. In response to this insight, Habermas develops a novel account of normativity, which locates the normative demands of critical theory within the socially instituted practice of communicative understanding. Although Habermas has claimed otherwise, this new foundation for critical theory constitutes a novel and innovative form of \"immanent critique.\" To argue for and to clarify this claim, I offer, in section 1, a formal account of immanent critique and distinguish between two different ways of carrying out such a critique.",

      "abstract": "Discourse ethics is originally conceived as a programme of philosophical justification of morality. This depends on the formal derivation of the moral principle (U) from non-moral principles. The moral theory is supposed to fall out of a pragmatic theory of meaning. The original programme plays a central role in Habermas's social theory: the moral theory, if true, provides good evidence for the more general theory of modernization. But neither Habermas nor his followers have succeeded in providing a formal derivation. This essay shows how and why Habermas's proposed derivation is impossible. As if aware of the lacuna, Habermas has recently suggested that (U) can be derived by 'abduction' rather than deduction. The proposal draws heavily on modernization theory; hence the only justification for (U) now available to him rests on premises drawn from that theory. The original programme of the justification of morality has thus given way to the weaker programme of the philosophical elucidation of morality. Further, since Habermas's moral theory is no longer justified independently of modernization theory, but at least partly by it, the moral theory cannot without circularity provide evidence for the modernization theory.",

Starting from the view that the ethics that organizations display in practice will have been forged through an ongoing process of debate and contestation over moral choices, we examine ethics in relation to the ambiguous, unpredictable, and subjective contexts of managerial action. Furthermore, we examine how discursively constituted practice relates to managerial subjectivity and the possibilities of managers being moral agents. The article concludes by discussing how the \u2018ethics as practice\u2019 approach that we expound provides theoretical resources for studying the different ways that ethics manifest themselves in organizations as well as providing a practical application of ethics in organizations that goes beyond moralistic and legalistic approaches.",

Within this context, J\u00fcrgen Habermas's theory of socio-cultural evolution has also become a specific object of critique, the best known in the English-speaking world being, perhaps, Michael Schmid's critique (1982). While the latter is ultimately based on neo-Darwinistic assumptions (1982a, 1987) which allow a non-Marxist alternative to be pitted against Habermas's position, a significant immanent critique has been taking shape during the late 1970s and 1980s the contours of which are at present starting to become visible, despite the fact that as yet it is nowhere developed and presented in a systematic manner. I have in mind here the work of younger authors belonging to the circle around Habermas, such as Johann Arnason, Axel Honneth, Hans Joas, G\u00fcnter Frankenberg, Ulrich R\u00f6del, and Klaus Eder, who have not only developed a critique of Habermas but are also engaged in developing an alternative to him within the framework of critical theory.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Power in communication takes two main forms. As \u2018external\u2019 power, it consists in the ability to acknowledge or disregard a speaker or a discourse. As \u2018internal\u2019 power, it is the ability of an argument to eliminate other arguments by demonstrating its superiority. A positive or negative value may be ascribed to these forms of power. Four ideal\u2010typical positions are discussed \u2013 strategy, technocracy, constructionism, and deliberation. Public deliberation has three virtues \u2013 civic virtue, governance virtue and cognitive virtue. Deliberation lowers the propensity to, and the benefit of, strategic behaviour. It also increases knowledge, enhancing the quality of decisions. For Habermas, the unity of reason is expressed in the possibility of agreement on the most convincing argument. However, sometimes conflicts are deeplying, principles and factual descriptions are profoundly different, and uncertainty is radical. The best argument cannot be found. There is no universal reason. The question is whether non\u2010strategic agreement may spring from the incommensurability of languages. In search of an answer, Rawls's concept of overlapping consensus, the feminist theory of the public sphere, and the idea of deliberation as co\u2010operation are discussed. The argument developed is that the approach to deliberative democracy may be renewed by rethinking its motivational and cognitive elements. Public deliberation is grounded on a pre\u2010political level of co\u2010operation. Intractable controversies may be faced at the level of practices, looking for local, contextual answers.",

For Bourdieu fields are characteristic of \u2018highly differentiated societies\u2019 and thus of modernity. \u2018The social cosmos is made up of a number of such relatively autonomous social microcosms\u2019, each with its own logic and \u2018network\u2026 of objective relations between positions\u2019, its rules of \u2018competency\u2019, and each possessing \u2018a species of capital\u2026 that is efficacious\u2019 in the given field. A field is not static, but is governed by certain \u2018regularities\u2019 that preserve its capital: \u2018As a space of potential and active forces, the field is also a field of struggles aimed at preserving or transforming the configuration of these forces\u2019 (Pierre Bourdieu and Loic J.D.

Concepts are definite notions produced by the \u2018understanding\u2019 while \u2018ideas\u2019 such as freedom or justice are produced by \u2018reason\u2019 and are not necessarily grounded in experience, hence can only be regulative and not constitutive.

Ralph Manheim [New York: Harcourt, 1957], p. 46). Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard and Jean-Loup Th\u00e9baud define the idea as a \u2018maximization of concepts outside of any knowledge of reality\u2019. \u2018The Idea is an almost unlimited use of the concept: one has concepts and then one maximizes them\u2019 (Just Gaming, trans.

Idealism can be defined as a specifically philosophical movement committed to dialectical totalization, identity, and system. However, Romanticism is the larger literary-cum-philosophical context within which Idealism emerges as an idea that is continually put under erasure. For as the author of \u2018The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism\u2019 (thought to be Hegel, Schelling, or H\u00f6lderlin) says: \u2018The philosophy of the Spirit is an aesthetic philosophy\u2019 in which \u201cideas\u201d are made \u201caesthetic, i.e., mythological' (in Philosophy of German Idealism, ed. Ernst Behler [New York: Continuum, 1987], p. 162).

Thus Comenius' Ianua has a section on games (see Tom McArthur, Worlds of Reference: lexicography, learning and language from the clay tablet to the computer [Cambridge University Press, 1988], p.114), while Bandini includes heresies and famous women in his encyclopedia (see Robert Collison, Encyclopaedias: Their History Throughout the Ages [New York: Hafner, 1966], pp. 70\u20131). In Vincent of Beauvais' Speculum Maius the circle of learning includes subjects such as crafts (see Collison, pp. 60\u20131). 23. The De Proprietatibus Rerum of Bartolomeus Anglicus, which follows the model of the mirror of creation, uses an alphabetic arrangement in its section on birds (See M.C.

Kant distinguishes physiological anthropology, or \u2018what Nature makes of man\u2019, from a pragmatic anthropology concerned with \u2018what man makes, can, or should make of himself as a freely acting being\u2019 (Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View, trans. Victor Lyle Dowdell [Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1978], p. 3). The distinction is analogous to that between nature and Spirit. 57. Schelling, Preface to On The World Soul (1810), quoted in Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature, p. 272n. Schelling's reference to the incompleteness of his earlier Ideas presumably alludes to his work on medicine, which draws on the ideas of the Scottish medical theorist John Brown. Schelling attempts to bring medicine into his early systematic work in his 1799 First Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature, trans. Keith R. Peterson (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004), pp. 158\u201372. However, he can only do so \u2018in the form of an appendix\u2019 (p. 159). 58.

      "abstract": "SPECTERS ARE ONCE AGAIN HAUNTING EUROPE AND AMERICA\u2014as are magicians, mermaids, mesmerists, and a melange of marvels once thought to have been exorcised by the rational and secular processes of modernity. In recent years, historians from disparate fields have independently challenged the long-standing sociological view that modernity is characterized by \u201cdisenchantment.\u201d This view, in its broadest terms, maintains that wonders and marvels have been demystified by science, spirituality has been supplanted by secularism, spontaneity has been replaced by bureaucratization, and the imagination has been subordinated to instrumental reason. In the past decade, however, a new historiographic position, if not consensus, has emerged that presents Western modernity as \u201cenchanted.\u201d The ongoing redefinition of such an established view is of consequence for a variety of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the master narratives underlying the stories that historians choose to tell. As Dipesh Chakrabarty usefully reminds us, \u201cThe moment we think of the world as disenchanted . . . we set limits to the ways the past can be narrated.\u201d1 The emergent view that modernity is as enchanted as it is disenchanted may conjure alternative vistas to the historical imagination, and at the very least offers the possibility of pulling new rabbits out of old hats. Narrating a historiography of \u201cmodernity and enchantment\u201d has limitations of its own, however. Those historians who challenge the equation of modernity with disenchantment often present their views within the context of topical debates in their respective fields. It will therefore be useful to tease out some of the common concerns and findings that have appeared in otherwise distinct areas of study, such as the histories of science, religion, and mass culture. The works examined here are necessarily eclectic, drawn primarily from European and American histories of these subfields, but they are nevertheless representative of how the topic is currently being handled across historical specialties. A second challenge has to do with defining such inherently vague and complex terms as \u201cmodernity\u201d and \u201cenchantment.\u201d Taken separately, each term has manifold meanings. When the two terms are paired under a particular interpretation of the relationship between \u201cmodernity and enchantment,\u201d however, each assumes greater",

      "abstract": "Abstract Over the last 50 years, policy makers and STEM educators have argued for Scientific Literacy (SL). SL is a typical boundary object that everyone can agree on, but that is filled with different meanings by different stakeholders. Roberts (as published in Abell SK, Lederman NG (eds), Handbook of research on science education. Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, pp. 729\u2013780, 2007) has identified two main orientations of SL: Vision I starts from and focuses on scientific content and scientific processes to learn about corresponding applications later, while Vision II focuses on contextualizing scientific knowledge for giving its use in life and society meaning. The tension between Vision I and II can also be related to the tension between \u201cpipeline science \u2013 preparing future scientists\u201d and \u201cscience for all\u201d. Recently, a more advanced vision of SL was suggested. It is called Vision III and emphasizes philosophical values, politicization and critical global citizenship education. Such an orientation can be well justified by the Central/Northern European educational and cultural tradition called Bildung . In its most contemporary understanding, it is agency-oriented. Bildung -oriented science education aims at making the student capable of a self-determined life in his/her socio-cultural environment, participation in a democratic society, and of empathy and solidarity with others. This concept is also closely connected to more recent educational paradigms that were defined also beyond Europe, e.g. the ideas of Education for Sustainability (EfS) and transformative learning. Both concepts aim on skills development for critical-democratic participation and for shaping our society and culture in a sustainable way. The different visions of SL have consequences for the content and culture of teaching and learning of science and technology. Accepting Vision III requires awareness that our view of selecting and teaching certain content is dependent on our culture, for example our norms, values and worldviews, and on the society we are living in. Learning (cognition) must be complemented with not only meta-learning (metacognition), but also transformative learning, where things are considered from multifaceted (e.g., cultural) perspectives. The discussion in this chapter focuses on educational implications of Vision III of SL and its connection to critical-reflexive Bildung , EfS and transformative learning.",

Like the leading figures of Action Fran\u00e7aise such as Charles Maurras and his disciples, these intellectuals were much inspired by the actionist philosophy of Bergson. Yet Turkish Bergsonians reached different conclusions by basing their traditionalism on the presentatist Bergsonian philosophy of time. Unlike their French counterparts, Turkish Bergsonians tried to put the actionist philosophy in the service of the Revolution. Action Fran\u00e7aise was a monarchist movement and \u2013 in Stephen Wilsons' words \u2013 utilized the \u2018irrationalist implications of traditionalism\u2019. Accordingly, Maurras tried to \u2018reconcile nationalism and royalism with history and tradition\u2019 and it was \u2018the core of the Action Fran\u00e7aise movement\u2019.

A range of criticisms are discussed which target the underlying premises, the analytical methodology and the disputed areas of reader response and the integration of contextual factors. Controversial issues such as the predominantly negative focus of much CDA scholarship, and the status of CDA as an emergent \u201cintellectual orthodoxy\u201d, are also reviewed. The conclusions offer a summary of the principal criticisms that emerge from this overview, and suggest some ways in which these problems could be attenuated.",

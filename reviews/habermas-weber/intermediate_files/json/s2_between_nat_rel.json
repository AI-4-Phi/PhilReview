Starting point of this new approach is found according to several authors from Jaspers in the so-called \u201caxial age\u201d. Taking the discourse on faith and knowledge as a guiding thread Habermas carries out a genealogy or history of thought that examines how the religious can be found even in the background of some forms of contemporary postmetaphysical philosophy. In his work, especially in his lastest book Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie Habermas develops a genealogy of thought from its religious roots, but accepts the weberian thesis of secularization. However Joas proposes an alternative to the weberian and habermasian conception of secularizing rationalization, because Joas considers that such a conception is problematic.",

This article argues that to articulate these multiple elements, Habermas adopts a robust framework built upon four conceptual pillars that can be clearly identified: postmetaphysical, postconventional, postnational, and postsecular. This \u201cconceptual plurality\u201d underlies his genealogy of the centuries-long tension and mutual learning between religious faith and scientific knowledge in the Western philosophical tradition. By considering the interplay of these concepts, it is possible to understand the several ways in which religion emerges in contemporary society and the equally multiple strategies Habermas uses to interpret religion throughout his career, which are masterfully reconsidered and articulated in his opus magnum on religion.",

      "abstract": "The author traces the correlation between secularization and desacralization occurring not only within the religious landscape (\"temple\") but also in the field of culture (\"museum\"). The symptoms of secularization are noted through the works of Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Michelangelo, da Messina, Botticelli and others, as well as through desacralization of sacred images, development of \"silhouette\" and \"vanitas\" still-life painting genres, appearance of winter landscape picture, coldness and \"moon\"-like features and shadows in the visual arts of 16th \u2014 18th centuries. Secularization trends are also noted in the development of 20th century Protestant theology where God transforms from transcendent to immanent being and can be found exclusively in the mundanity, in the \"mass of people\" (Dietrich Bonhoeffer).\n\nThe secularization and desacralization have led to formation of rather peculiar forms of contemporary Christianity such as \"prosperity theology\" and even paradoxic \"civil religion\" (Robert Bellah). The author concludes that the symptoms of secularization, particularly, the pronounced feelings of existential discomfort experienced by contemporary humans (the feeling of \"missing something\"), are caused by numinous capacity for religious perception, that serves as a priori attribute of human beings (Rudolf Otto). Thus, it is too early to declare that religion has no place in the public space of contemporary society (Jurgen Habermas).",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the current stage of development of society, associated with the formation of a new type of relationship between the secular and the religious consciousness. If in the secular society of the recent past, these relations were based on the domination of secular ideology, and religious consciousness was interpreted as the evolutionary past of society, the significance of which decreases with social progress until the complete disappearance of religion, then post-secular culture is associated with the formation of a new constructive attitude towards the religious consciousness as an immanent component of social consciousness, which does not disappear with the development of society, but only changes the forms of expression, as well as with the formation of an equal dialogue between secular and religious. Post-secularism does not mean a return to the dominant position of religion and does not cancel the achievement of the secular paradigm. Secularism has transcoding the cultural matrix, therefore, it is no longer possible to take a central meaning and value-forming place in the culture of religion and confessional traditions that once gave birth to this culture. In addition, globalization creates a situation of interaction of religious traditions, unprecedented in the history of mankind, within the framework of one cultural and legal field. We are no longer talking about oppression by more progressive traditions of spiritually primitive traditions (Christianity or Islam in relation to paganism) - traditions with highly developed spiritual, intellectual and missionary potential have to interact with each other. Post-secularity means not only a critical revision of the stage consciousness, but also openness, receptivity, and at least interest in all the various forms of human religiosity. Secularization must be understood, according to J.\u00a0Habermas, as the dual and complementary learning. Modernization embraces religious and secular consciousness, modifying them. This process of learning, change and enrichment is the essence of the post-secular era. The main characteristic of post-secular society is the \"two-way learning process\" of faith and reason, or their correlation. In the field of education, the necessary result of the formation of a post-secular society is the introduction of dialogue and tolerance as necessary principles of educational activity and the absence of discrimination on religious grounds.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. The article examines the current philosophical debates about the relationship between secular and religious worldviews. The article outlines recent forms of postsecularization as the continued existence of religious communities in a continually secularizing environment, identifying its main dimensions: the deinstitutionalization of the religious lifestyle, the individualization of faith, and the development of new social forms in the religious field. Theoretical analysis. The central premise of the study is that existing approaches are not only controversial, but have their limitations to describing perspectives of secular-religious dialogue in a constructive way. On the basis of the discursive approach rational-discursive and relativistic-conventional strategies of secular-religious dialogue are identified and discussed. In this context, J. Habermas suggests that religion and secular worldviews have to learn from each other, and religion has to be \u201ctranslated\u201d into the rational language of secular culture, neutralizing its most dangerous components. At the same time, J. Milbank finds the essentialization of secular reason problematic. In conclusion, perspectives of secular-religious dialogue in the context of Russian culture are discussed. The essence of this model consists in the search for a compromise between the extremes of dogmatic faith and secular reason.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to explain the contestation of Islam in the public sphere. As the majority religion, Islam always presents a debate about the position of Islam in the public sphere which is often misused for political and power interests. This study uses a comparative study between secularization practices in Indonesia and the West. The theory used in this study is Jurgen Habermas\u2019 view of the public sphere, which is an open means of making every citizen a communicative society. This study shows that the contestation of Islam in the public sphere is very hard by following the ideology of a country in placing symbols and Islamic identities in the public sphere. In Indonesian context, restrictions on religious expression cannot be restricted, let alone to be prohibited by the state as the holder of power.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Despite his hostility to religion in his early career, since the turn of the century Habermas has devoted his research to the relationship between faith and knowledge. His two-volume Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie is the culmination of this project. Spurred by the attacks of 9/11 and the growing conflict between religion and the forces of secularization, I argue that this philosophy of history is the centerpiece of an important turning point in Habermas\u2019s intellectual development. Instead of interpreting religion merely as part of the history of postmetaphysical thinking, Habermas now sees it as a crucial normative resource for both philosophy and social cohesion in the future aswell. Despite its backward-looking approach,my basic thesis is that this book is best understood as a forward-looking appeal for a tolerant, self-reflective democratic politics that brings religious and secular citizens together dialogically through the cooperative use of their rational freedom.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A central, secularizing plot of John Milton's Paradise Regained is the dissolution of Satan. As the Son passes from scriptural figure to reality, Satan is gradually reduced from mythological character to metaphor. While both the demythologization of evil and the explanation of religious concepts as metaphor have long histories as central examples of secularization and of the liberalization of religion, theorists from the political-theological right (e.g., Carl Schmitt) and postsecularist left (e.g., Talal Asad) have called attention to the analogies that can be drawn between apparently secular concepts and stories and earlier, religious doctrines and myths, claiming that such analogies call into question the legitimacy and distinctiveness of the secular. Against those critiques, I argue that secularization stories can be distinguished from religious narrative, albeit not for their naturalism, their liberalism, their rationalism, or other doctrinal content. Rather, they force us to face their own constructed, literary qualities.",

In these 10 essays he explores the ethical and political dimensions of the modernity/postmodernity debates.Bernstein argues that modernity/postmodernity should be understood as a pervasive mood - what Heidegger calls a Stimmung - one that is amorphous, shifting, and protean but that nevetheless exerts a powerful influence on our current ways of thinking and acting. Focusing on such thinkers as Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, Rorty, and Habermas, Bernstein seeks to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of their work and to highlight the ways in which they have contributed to the formation of a new and distinctive constellation of ideas and themes.Richard J.

Following an introductory overview of Habermas's work by Richard Bernstein, Albrecht Wellmer's essay places the philosopher within the tradition of Hegel, Marx, Weber, and Critical Theory. Martin Jay discusses Habermas's views on art and aesthetics, and Joel Whitebook examines his interpretations of Freud and psychoanalysis, Anthony Giddens offers a critical reading of Habermas's major work, The Theory of Communicative Action. Richard Rorty criticizes the whole thrust of his program by way of a comparison with the work of the French philosopher of postmodernity, Jean-Francois Lyotard. And Thomas McCarthy concentrates on the question of the selectivity of rationalization processes in the modern age. himself has three contributions - on Marcuse, on neoconservativism, and a reply to the other essayists.

      "abstract": "Critical theory, as conceived by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, distinguishes itself from traditional theory by claiming to be a theory with In this regard, it finds its inspiration in Marx's famous Eleventh Thesis: philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.' Contemporary critical theory, in the work of Jurgen Habermas, similarly draws its inspiration from the Marxian imperative to change the world, but interprets its task as the identification and clarification of the conditions for emancipated living. These conditions are grounded in a formal, procedural conception of rationality that leaves questions of substantive content to be determined by the participants themselves. While many have thought that Habermas has been mistaken to be so restrictive in the range of issues he allows for theory, his perspective is democratic in that it discourages theorists from making unwarranted claims to knowledge and aims to establish a basis for full and equal participation in community decision-making. He is certainly not indifferent to the others who have been excluded from the discourses of modernity, and his theory2 is an attempt to elucidate the ethical-political discourses in which the disinherited of the modem world can press to have their views discussed and their claims to rightness redeemed. Nonetheless, and despite these democratic aims, contemporary critical theory, in its Habermasian formulation, has seemed to many to be curiously disengaged from the world, and it is with some concern that the theory's proponents see the disinherited of modernity-variously defined as women, Blacks, gays, lesbians, native peoples, prisoners-finding their aspirations reflected in the increasing number of postmodern theories heavily influenced by genealogy and deconstruction. Recent critical theory, viewed from the standpoint of claims to have a practical intent and action orientation, is understandably the defensive. For is the point of wanting to effect fundamental social and political change, if those whose interest it is supposed to be to have such change do not see themselves addressed in the theory? In the last few years several adherents of critical theory have suggested that the opposition between modernity and postmodernity-an opposition fostered both sides of the modern/postmodern divide-is overdrawn, unproductive, and unnecessary, and there have been attempts by some to accommodate postmodern concerns by mediating between critical theory and the newer critiques. My essay begins by discussing two such efforts, those of Richard Bernstein and Thomas McCarthy.4 There are important differences between these two writers, but each seeks to regain some of the ground lost to postmodernism by arguing that the reconstructive project of critical theory is a necessary corrective to limitations in the newer methodologies and remains course to succeed, especially as regards its ability to deliver the idea of a practical intent. After discussing the argument provided by Bernstein and McCarthy, I offer an alternative assessment of is at issue between critical theory and postmodernism by turning to the question of gender. I conclude by resituating the problem of critical theory's supposed disengagement from the world. Bernstein tells us that his book, The New Constellation, arose out of suggestions that he take on Heidegger and the French. The more closely he examined the two poles of modernity and postmodernity, the more convinced he became that our modern/postmodern condition has to be understood as arising out of a constellation of social and political forces and as calling for a new understanding of how we should live in the world. The ethical-political question is the dominant motif in Bernstein's book and he formulates it as follows: critique in the name of what? or what are we affirming and why are we affirming it when we engage in critique? \u2026",

To provide a better understanding as to why empowerment programs often fail and to suggest how such failures may be averted, we examine the power behind empowerment. Ironically, although power and empowerment are inextricably linked, much of the work on empowerment in the business literature has been devoid of any discussion of power. We present a four-dimensional model which shows the multifaceted way in which power works. In it, we observe the similarities and differences in the ways that different theorists have approached the study of power, notably those ascribing to mainstream, critical, and Foucauldian perspectives. We then use this power model as a lens with which to examine empowerment practices in business. This analysis suggests a number of possible reasons for the failure of business empowerment programs and provides directions for future research and practice which might address these shortcomings.",

Yet he resorts to an evolutionary normative argument that undermines the sociological powers of the two classical theories and contradicts the pragmatists' historical approach to values. This essay explains the significance of Habermasian theory for the emancipatory tradition, analyzes certain problems of the theory, and argues that an expanded dialogue with American pragmatism would strengthen both its sociological and its normative dimensions. Though the explicit focus is on the emancipatory tradition, the essay raises broader critical questions about pseudohistorical, normative justification in general sociological theory.",

The theme at issue, 'non\u2010identity', comes in several varieties; and the point of Adorno's dialectic, namely reconciliation, is multifaceted. Exploration of those topics shows that negative dialectic seques into substantive doctrines, including a version of transcendentalism and a claim about deformation. The peculiar methodological status of negative dialectic explains that adumbration. In the appraisive register, my principal contentions include these: Adorno's transcendentalism makes some sense of the aforementioned deformation claim; and negative dialectic qua method avoids mystery and metaphysical excess. Keywords: negative dialecticAdornononidentityreconciliationdeformation Notes \u2217 Several anonymous referees helped to improve this paper. My thanks also to Peter Dews, Fabian Freyenhagen, and Timo Juetten, none of whom should be construed as holding my views. 1 Recent work on Adorno upon which I shall draw includes the books by Bernstein (2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), O'Connor (2004 O'Connor, Brian. 2004. Adorno's Negative Dialectic: Philosophy and the Possibility of Critical Rationality, Cambridge, Mass. and London: MIT Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), and Cook (2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). However, and as will become evident, what follows does not attempt anything like a full engagement with those works. 2 I shall focus upon ND's Introduction and second part. The latter's title is 'Negative Dialektik. Begrif fund Kategorien'. The Begriff is negative dialectic. The Kategorien are notions, such as 'the transcendental' and the concept of dialectic itself, that are to 'retained as well as qualitatively altered' (ND xx; cf. LND 62f., 101,121). I give no special attention to ND's last part. For that part comprises 'models' of negative dialectic; and those models intertwine negative dialectic with its results (q.v. \u00a74 below) especially tightly. I shall draw freely upon Adorno's lecture courses. Those courses somewhat relax Adorno's heterodox style and his suspicion of what he calls (H 98) the Klarheitsideal. On that ideal, and for an argument that treatments of Adorno can and even should overrule that suspicion, see Joll, 2009 Joll, Nicholas. 2009. 'How Should Philosophy Be Clear? Loaded Clarity, Default Clarity, and Adorno'. Telos, 146(Spring 2009): 73\u201395. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]. 3 In Adorno and Hegel alike \u2013 and Adorno inherits the notions of universal, particular, and mediation from Hegel \u2013 'mediation' translates Vermittlung (a term that Ashton's ND renders as 'transmission'), 'universal' das Allgemeine, and 'particular' das Besondere. But Hegel also uses Partikular for 'particular'. 4 \u00a73 treats non\u2010identity. \u00a74 considers how Adorno's dialectic is negative in a sense beyond that of involving items that somehow oppose or negate each other. One sees here that that my short list of 'fundamentals' excludes features important to negative dialectic. But one has to start somewhere (compare LND 25). More problematic is Adorno's claim that dialectic lacks a foundation (ND xix; Grundlage), that it 'cannot be maintained as a structure that will stay basic no matter how it is modified' (ND 136). \u00a74 tries to both to diffuse and to explain that point. 5 The modality ('can all be \u2026') suggests a point that Adorno, who at one point glosses mediation as 'entanglement in context' (ND 106), would seem to accept. To wit: what counts as a universal or a particular will vary with context or interest. 6 The presupposition here is that everything is (or can be \u2013 see the previous note) either a universal or a particular. 7 'Dialectic is the consistent consciousness of nonidentity [Nichtidentit\u00e4t].' 8 '[T]he continuing irreconcilability of subject and object [\u2026] constitutes the theme of dialectical criticism.' 9 \u00a73 considers how objective mediation might go awry. Some statements (ND 6, 312; LND 16, 165) suggest that, anyway, mismediation by universals of particulars is more important for Adorno than the mismediation of universals by particulars. 10 \u00a72.1 fleshes out the idea of inadequacy, albeit in a restricted context. Adorno also says (ND, part 2, passim; LND 7f) that universals can 'contradict' particulars. 11 Can the author of Zur Metakritik der Erkenntnistheorie consistently hold, or be imputed, epistemological opinions? Adorno rejected epistemology because he identified it with first philosophy (see \u00a72.3). Yet it is unclear that Adorno's first\u2010philosophical sense of epistemology encompasses all that plausibly counts as theory of knowledge. For presumably Adorno would not so indict his own view that to know is to identify. His position may be that his views about knowledge escape (first\u2010philosophical) epistemology because they are conceived, as first\u2010philosophical ideas are not, as historically relative. Certainly he held a difficult doctrine whereby truth has a 'temporal core' (see for example M 45). Adorno's ideas about knowledge in utopia may seem to accord with such a doctrine. But \u00a73.1 will suggest that those ideas comprise an account, although a minimal one, of genuine knowledge. 12 For reading 1, see: Osborne, 1989 Osborne, Peter. 1989. \"'Adorno and the Metaphysics of Modernism: The Problem of a \"Postmodern\" Art'\".

(but note that 'particularity thesis' is my term). Jay Bernstein, from whom I take reading 2, construes the density thesis as a qualified version of conceptualism that betters the unqualified version by recognizing the density of experience. See Bernstein, 2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press.

Routledge: London and New York. [Google Scholar]: pp. 220\u20132ff. One might count as a third reading an inflection \u2013 a radicalization \u2013 of the first reading. I have in mind the view that the Adornian non\u2010identical is something ineffable. Finlayson, 2002 Finlayson, James Gordon. 2002. 'Adorno on the Ethical and the Ineffable'. European Journal of Philosophy, 101(April): 1\u201325. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] is a developed version of such a view. 13 For the new reading, see Hammer, 2000 Hammer, Espen. 2000.

Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 102f. (which defends the received reading and the idea it imputes). One should admit, I think, that the new reading is somewhat reconstructive. For Adorno does stress a kind of incommensurability between thought and its objects (see especially LND). Relatedly, he tends to confuse predication with identification (see esp. LND 8 and cf. Geuss 1975 Geuss, Raymond. 1975. 'Negative Dialectics'. Journal of Philosophy, LXXII(6): 167\u201375. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 172f. and Schn\u00e4delbach 2007 Schn\u00e4delbach, Herbert. 2007. \"'The dialectical critique of reason: Adorno's construction of rationality'\". In Theodor W. Adorno. Critical Evaluations in Cultural Theory, Edited by: Jarvis, Simon. Vol. 1, London and New York: Routledge. (2007) [Google Scholar]: p. 159). 14 'Identity thinking says what something comes under, what it exemplifies or represents, and what, accordingly, it is not itself' (ND 149). 'The moment of nonidentity in the identifying judgment is immediately understandable insofar as each individual object subsumed under a class has determinations not contained in the definition of the class' (ND 150). 15 Some echoes: Wittgenstein (1975 Wittgenstein, Ludwig. 1975. The Blue and Brown Books: Preliminary Studies for the 'Philosophical Investigations', Oxford: Blackwell. [Google Scholar]: pp. 17\u201319) diagnosed a philosophical 'craving for generality'; William James maintained that 'something always escapes' (1987 James, William. 1987. Writings 1902\u20131910, New York: Library of America. [Google Scholar]: p. 776). 16 A further argument (H 9, M 47\u201356, and 71, S 267) tries to use the idea of conceptual holism against first philosophy. Adorno's notion of 'constellation' (on which one may see Stone, 2008 Stone, Alison. 2008. \"'Adorno and Logic'\". In Theodor Adorno: Key Concepts, Edited by: Cook, Deborah. 47\u201362. Stocksfield, , UK: Acumen. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) suggests such holism. But I am unclear about the details of Adorno's argument. 17 Loux (2002 Loux, Michael J. 2002. Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction , 2nd edn, London and New York: Routledge. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 9 and Ch. 7) uses the epithet 'conceptual schemers' to refer to Quine, Putnam, and Rorty. See also Goodman (1984 Goodman, Nelson. 1984. Of Mind and Other Matters, Cambridge, Mass. and London: Harvard University Press. [Google Scholar]: p. 36): 'Now as we thus make constellations by picking out and putting together certain stars rather than others, so we make stars by drawing certain boundaries rather than others. Nothing dictates whether the sky shall be marked off into constellations or other objects. We have to make what we find, be it the Great Dipper, Sirius, food, fuel, or a stereo system.' 18 Vogel, 1996 Vogel, Steven. 1996. \"'Reification and the Nonidentical: On the Problem of Nature in Luk\u00e1cs and Adorno'\". In Phenomenology, Interpretation and Community, Edited by: Stephen, Lenore Langsdorf, Watson, H. and Marya Bower, E. 253\u2013268. New York: State University of New York Press. [Google Scholar]: p. 262; Rosen, 1982 Rosen, Michael. 1982. Hegel's Dialectic and its Criticism, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 104f. Adorno himself has this worry about Kant. Note further that the 'scheme' at issue extends from concepts to other interests or orientations: to our sociality and our animality. 19 Habermas (1992 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1992. Postmetaphysical Thinking: Philosophical Essays, Edited by: Hohengarten, William Mark. Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: pp. 3\u201351 and passim) defines post\u2010metaphysical thinking as thinking that eschews both any strong form of naturalism and Platonistic commitments. (McDowell's Mind and World uses the notion of 'bald naturalism' to characterize the type of strong naturalism that is at issue here.) Habermas holds that, by dint of his remaining within 'the philosophy of consciousness', Adorno is still metaphysical. Hammer, 2000 Hammer, Espen. 2000. 'Minding the World: Adorno's Critique of Idealism'. Philosophy and Social Criticism, 26(1): 71\u201392. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] analyses the imputed paradigm and denies that Adorno fits it. 20 On 'late capitalism', see Cook 2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 11\u201317. For the view about how animality affects our thinking, see: SO 504; DE 26f., 187\u20139; MM \u00a779; Adorno, 1984 Adorno, Theodor W. 1984. \"'The Idea of Natural History'\". In Telos Edited by: Hullot\u2010Kentor, R. Vol. 60, 111\u201324. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]. Freud considerably influences Adorno's thoughts on self\u2010preservation. 21 As is scientism, construed as the view that 'all knowledge can potentially be converted to science' (Adorno, 1991 Adorno, Theodor W. 1991. Notes to Literature, Edited by: Nicholsen, Shierry Weber. Vol. 1, New York: Columbia University Press. [Google Scholar]: p. 8). Adorno rejects that view thus: 'The object of undiminished experience is more objective [than] the indeterminate substrate of reductionism' (CM 250; cf. esp. KCPR 25 and ME 15). 22 Arguably, indeed, 'Adorno's philosophy is best seen as an inflection of Weber's analysis of disenchantment and societal rationalization' (Bernstein, 2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 30). 23 See DE 20 and, for instance, AT 4, MM 239, and ND 11 and 161. 24 One glimpses here that Adorno 'refunctions' ontology too. 'Ontology is to be concretely and historically radicalized' (Adorno, 1984 Adorno, Theodor W. 1984. \"'The Idea of Natural History'\". In Telos Edited by: Hullot\u2010Kentor, R. Vol. 60, 111\u201324. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 121). For Adorno's attack on (un\u2010refunctioned) ontology as first philosophy, see especially ME 8 and 19. 25 Since Adorno deems 'enlightenment' 'a restricted reason' (ND 317; see also esp. CM 148ff.), the deformation claim does not indict reason as such. Still: Adorno's anti\u2010Platonism \u2013 his Hegelianism, Marxism, and even (see LND, passim) empiricism \u2013 commits him to denying any reality, or at least efficacy, to a reason lacking all actualization. This may be why he speaks of his allegiance to enlightenment as a 'petitio principii' (DE xvi). Yet Adorno believes that a reason more worthy of the name has some actuality (see \u00a73.2). To that extent, the charge that Adorno attacks the very reason that his attack employs (see esp. Habermas, 1987 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1987. The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures, Edited by: Lawrence, Frederick. Cambridge: Polity. [Google Scholar]: pp. 119ff. and 1984: pp. 384\u20136) is awry. Bernstein (2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 266f.) and O'Connor (2004 O'Connor, Brian. 2004. Adorno's Negative Dialectic: Philosophy and the Possibility of Critical Rationality, Cambridge, Mass. and London: MIT Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 165\u201370), inter alios, provide similar rebuttals to Habermas's charge. 26 'Exchange' (Tausch) in Adorno abbreviates 'the exchange relationship' (Tauschverh\u00e4lt) or 'exchange process' (Tauschvorgang). In what follows, I mean to improve upon what I regard as the best extant accounts of the Adorno\u2013Luk\u00e1cs relation, namely those provided by Habermas (1984 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1984. \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". In Reason and the Rationalization of Society, Edited by: McCarthy, Thomas. Vol. 1, Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: Ch. 4) and Cook (2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 39\u201349). 27 That Adorno accepts the ideas of mystery and fetishism is evident (ND 140, 178, 315; ME 37ff.; MM 239; H 126; S 270). However, some of his uses of 'reification' (Verdinglichung) impute what I (and Cook \u2013 see 2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 45) call commodification. See, for instance, MM 228ff. 28 I have corrected a typographical error in Luk\u00e1cs, 1922 Luk\u00e1cs, Georg. 1922. History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics, Edited by: Livingstone, Rodney. Manchester: Merlin Press, 1971. [Google Scholar]. 29 Habermas uses the phrase 'rationalisation\u2010as\u2010reification' (1984 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1984. \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". In Reason and the Rationalization of Society, Edited by: McCarthy, Thomas. Vol. 1, Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: p. 339) to impute broadly the same idea(s) to Luk\u00e1cs. 30 See, e.g., Habermas, 1984 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1984. \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". In Reason and the Rationalization of Society, Edited by: McCarthy, Thomas. Vol. 1, Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: p. 355. Adorno, too, takes Luk\u00e1cs this way (see the next note). 31 True, Adorno does not use 'reification' and cognates to mean reifying rationalization. Sometimes, indeed, he seems to reject even that latter idea. First, he faults Luk\u00e1cs's doctrine of reification for idealism (ND 191f.). But one can retain Luk\u00e1csian reifying rationalization, even in an ontological version, while limiting the dependence reality has on thought. The same stretch of ND seemingly downplays the importance of reification. But close reading suggests that Adorno does not downplay Luk\u00e1csian reification (reifying rationalization). Finally: Luk\u00e1cs takes exchange as model and cause of reification, whereas Adorno traces deformation to thought. But Adorno connects exchange very closely to thought. On that point, see what follows in the main text. See also: IS 15f., 31, 64f.; S 270; KCPR 174. See additionally \u2013 on the admittedly strange idea that society influences what there is not only through concepts but somehow as, or analogously to, a concept \u2013 IS 32 and 37. 32 KCPR 176, DE 167, MM 69f., and ND 56 make comparable claims. 33 'The reconciled condition would not be the philosophical imperialism of annexing the alien. Instead, its happiness would lie in the fact that the alien, in the proximity it is granted, remains what is distant and different, beyond the heterogeneous and beyond that which is one's own' (ND 191; see also ND 10). 34 'The formulation \"negative dialectic\" offends against tradition. As early as Plato, dialectic intended to produce something positive through the intellectual means of negation; the figure of a \"negation of negation\" came to name this succinctly. This book would like to free dialectics from such affirmativity without reducing its determinacy' (ND xix). On the contrasts that Adorno perceives between his dialectic and Hegel's, see esp. H and LND. Sherratt (2002 Sherratt, Yvonne. 2002. Adorno's Positive Dialectic, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) argues that Adorno's dialectic is positive in that it involves normative models of knowledge and of the self. I do not quite disagree. But the present section argues that Adorno's account of such a reconciled state is minimal. 35 See ND 51, 124, 277. Adorno (ND 207) likens his prohibition to 'the theological ban on images'. The Marxian idea of utopia has always understood itself as the reappropriation of 'alienated' religious hopes. But Benjamin influences Adorno here too. 36 If not in name; only ND 147\u201351 uses the term rationale Identit\u00e4t. 37 Adorno does seem to hold that art, or more precisely philosophical interpretation of some modernist art, can anticipate a better world to a greater degree than can philosophy alone. See esp. AT 73, 132, 227 and, for commentary, Osborne, 1989 Osborne, Peter. 1989. \"'Adorno and the Metaphysics of Modernism: The Problem of a \"Postmodern\" Art'\". In The Problems of Modernity: Adorno and Benjamin, Edited by: Benjamin, Andrew. 23\u201348. London and New York: Routledge. [Google Scholar]. 38 Adorno does impart two further, minimal, points. (1) Reconciliation involves the satisfaction of basic needs (ND 303f., MM 155f., AT 33). (2) Social reconciliation would involve the absence of reification (commodification, reifying rationalization) and the transformation of commodity exchange (ND 146f.). 39 'Es gibt kein richtiges Leben im falschen' (MM 39 / GS4 43). On this conception, and on the ethical dimension to Adorno's thought more generally, see, in the first instance, Freyenhagen, 2008 Freyenhagen, Fabian. 2008. \"'No Easy Way Out: Adorno's Negativism and the Problem of Normativity'\". In Nostalgia for a Redeemed Future: Critical Theory, Edited by: Ludovisi, S. Giacchetti. 39\u201350. Newark, Del: University of Delaware Press. [Google Scholar]. 40 This is the sense (see n. 4 above) in which dialectic 'cannot be maintained as a structure that will stay basic no matter how it is modified'. 41 In claiming (1976: p. 9) that 'dialectics does not accede to the criterion of the definition but instead criticises it', Adorno intends also the idea that dialectic identifies forms of non\u2010identity and thus, in various ways, reveals deficiencies to definitions. See also ND 141. 42 ND 164f. compares dialectic to Weber's procedure with ideal types.

      "abstract": "\"In their study of social practices deemed traditional, scholars tend to use the concept and idea of tradition as an element of meaning in the practices under investigation. But just whose meaning is it? Is it a meaning generated by those who study tradition or those whose traditions are being studied? In both cases, particular criteria for traditionality are employed, whether these are explicated or not. Individuals and groups will no doubt continue to uphold their traditional practices or refer to their practices as traditional. While they are in no way obliged to explicate in analytical terms their criteria for traditionality, the same cannot be said for those who make the study of traditions their profession. In scholarly analysis, traditions need to be explained instead of used as explanations for apparent repetitions and replications or symbolic linking in social practice, values, history, and heritage politics. This book takes a closer look at \u2018tradition\u2019 and \u2018folklore\u2019 in order to conceptualize them within discourses on modernity and modernism. The first section discusses \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 as modern concepts and the study of folklore as a modern trajectory. The underlying tenet here is that non-modernity cannot be represented without modern mediation, which therefore makes the representations of non-modernity epistemologically modern. The second section focuses on the nation-state of Finland and the nationalistic use of folk traditions in the discursive production of Finnish modernity and its Others. The insights are applicable worldwide in discussions on cultural representation. \"",

      "abstract": "Abstract Contemporary post-truth discourses put the constructivist foundations of Discourse Studies to a test. According to critical observers, discourse analysts have been playing into the hands of Trump, Brexit and right-wing populists by politicising scientific knowledge and undermining the idea of scientific truth. In order to respond to these concerns, this article outlines a Strong Programme in Discourse Studies. While the Strong Programme insists on truths as discursive constructions, in no way does it claim that all ideas have the same truth value or that an idea can become true because somebody wants it to be true. The Strong Programme makes the case for discourse research that is constructivist (it asks how truths are constructed practically) without being relativist (all ideas do not have the same normative quality). Taking inspiration from debates in Science and Technology Studies of the 1970s, the Strong Programme formulates principles for discourse researchers dealing with conflicting truth claims. Discourse analytical explanations of truths of first-order participants and of second-order observers should be symmetrical, heterogeneous, multi-perspectival and reflexive. The Strong Programme discourse research is grounded in the founding traditions of \u201cFrench\u201d and \u201cCritical\u201d Discourse Studies, which have struggled over questions of truth and reality since the beginning. While critically interrogating the structuralist heritage of these strands, the Strong Programme insists on the practices of making and unmaking ideas through language use no matter whether they appear as true or false to participants and observers. Discourse Studies are encouraged to critically reflect on how hierarchies between knowledges are not only represented but, through their representation, also constituted through discursive practices.",

In this paper the authors argue that, without a culture of dialogical encounter, management scholarship will never be able to emerge from its adolescence, and management will not develop into the profession that it should and can become. The central proposition is that the highly fragmented landscape of management (practice and scholarship) lacks sufficient capability for dialogue among the plurality of actors situated across that landscape. Developing the dialogical capability ultimately required to break this fundamental impasse demands, first, a shared sense of purpose and responsibility (akin to the Hippocratic Oath in medicine) and, second, institutional entrepreneurship to establish more and better \u2018trading zones\u2019. Drawing on the philosophy of pragmatism, the authors further this endeavour by identifying and proposing key elements of a statement of shared purpose and responsibility. Finally, they explore the nature and characteristics of successful trading zones, highlighting particular examples that have already been created in management studies.",

      "abstract": "The complex and problematic role of religion in the public sphere in modern, democratic societies raises many questions for a public theology. The aim of this article is to contribute to the ongoing debate about the task and methods of public theology by asking what we can learn from the ideas of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Habermas was a leading participant in the thinking process on the secularisation thesis in Western societies. His view was that religion will eventually disappear from the public scene due to the rationalisation of society. In recent years he seems to have changed this view in the light of new developments in the world. He now maintains that religion has something important to offer in the public sphere. Religion could thus participate in this public discussion, provided that it satisfies strict conditions. We argue that public theology can learn from Habermas\u2019s recent ideas regarding religion in the public sphere: attention should be paid to the cognitive potential of religion, especially regarding the importance of the lifeworld and the role of religion in social solidarity with the needy and vulnerable; hermeneutical self-reflection is important; a distinction should be made between the role of religion in faith communities and in public life; we have to accept that we live in a secular state; and we have to learn the possibilities and impossibilities of translating from religious vocabulary into a secular vocabulary in order to be able to participate in the discussions in the public sphere.",

It proposes that historians and theorists of twentieth-century architecture might do well to retain the notion of modernism in architecture as a coherent phenomenon, but to conceptualize it neither as a stock if variable constellation of formal tropes nor as any of the other instructive but partial alternatives that scholars have proposed. Instead, it should be conceptualized as a discourse. The concept of discourse, and the conceptualization of modernism in architecture as a discourse, resolves many analytical problems and handles the broad range of anomalous cases that have emerged in the framework of the style-based paradigm. Conceived as discourse rather than style, modernist architecture becomes both more coherent-a structured field containing a variety of equivalent strains-and more pluralistic-a heterologous array of formal practices and individual positions. The fundamental premise of the discourse of modernism is that architecture must instantiate an ethically grounded material practice that grapples with, rather than categorically rejects or ignores, the phenomenon of modernity itself.",

      "abstract": "The twentieth-century obsession with meaning often fails to address the central questions: Why are we here? Where are we going? In this radical critique of modernity, Eugene (Rochberg-) Halton resurrects pragmatism, pushing it beyond its traditional formulations to meet these questions head on. Drawing on the works of the early pragmatists such as John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, and particularly C.S. Peirce, Meaning and Modernity is an ambitious attempt to reconstruct concepts from philosophical pragmatism for contemporary social theory. Through a vigorous and illuminating dialogue with other perspectives in the social sciences, (Rochberg-) Halton reveals the value of the pragmatic attitude as a mode of thought, one which speaks to the contemporary hunger for significance in a world where rationalized technique has all too often severed subject and object from their living context... Throughout the work is a sustained critique of modern culture in which (Rochberg-) Halton brings his reconstruction of the pragmatic atttude to bear on twentieth-century thought and its counterparts in the expressive arts. His engaging analysis encompasses figures as diverse as Simmel, Freud, Wittgenstein, Schoenberg, Adolph Loos, Mumford, Melville, the \"Vienna School of Fantastic Realism,\" and Doris Lessing. The author's semiotic approach to culture allows him to move freely and easily across many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, communications, art, literature, and philosophy. This is a work of rare originality and power that is sure to provoke discussion, for Rochberg-Halton creates new premises for understanding the human web of meaning. In a review published in the London Times Literary Supplement, Charles Townshend said that (Rochberg-) Halton's, \u201canswer to the dilemma of modernity is a still more striking synthesis, which he labels \u2018critical animism\u2019 (as distinct from primitive animism). Meaning and Modernity belies its conventional exterior: it is a passionate tract against the 'diabolical tyranny of the rational'...He pits his researches into the attitudes of Chicagoans to their household goods and to their city against the abstract semioticians who have emptied signs of their capacity to 'live objectively in the transactions people have with them'...Such humanism will probably strike his fellow social theorists as downright weird, but his work shows that the cracking shell of modernism will provide a rich intellectual agenda.\u201d",

      "abstract": "The present paper, based on Verschueren\u201fs (1999) Linguistic Adaptation Theory (LAT), proposes a pragmatic model for the analysis of interdiscursivity. Specifically, the paper begins with a brief delimitation of the research object so as to distinguish it from any other similar linguistic phenomena. Then the relevant literature on interdiscursivity is reviewed from the diachronic as well as synchronic dimensions. At the same time, a brief outline of the problems in the existing studies on interdiscursivity is presented and the relevant theories that will be applied to tackle these problems are introduced in detail, which will provide a solid theoretical and practical basis for the analytical model. Finally, the pragmatic model of the present study is built up and presented in the form of a flow chart. In this pragmatic model, the functioning of interdiscursivity is taken as adaptation to variables of the physical, social, and mental world. Interdiscursivity can be understood as the outcome of producers\u201f choice making, dynamic negotiation and linguistic adaptation. The interpretation of interdiscursivity, on the other hand, can be better achieved by tracing the specific ways of meaning generation from the four focal points of context, structure, dynamics, and salience, while at the same time taking into account the variability of interdiscursivity. Various kinds of communicative functions are realized when the interpretation of interdiscursivity is successfully completed. It is hoped that this pragmatic model may shed some light on the understanding of interdiscursivity.",

He points out the importance of informal learning for creating tacit attitudes and values, knowledge and skills which influence (conscious, planned) learning \u2013 formal and non-formal. Moreover, he explores the implications of informal learning for educational planners and teachers in the context of lifelong learning. While mainly aimed at adult educators, the book\u2019s arguments apply also to schooling and higher education, in both industrialised societies and developing countries where large numbers of children and adults are not and have not been in school and so rely on informal learning to manage change.",

Relevant disciplinary perspectives on global English are examined in this light, including superdiversity, translanguaging, translingual practice, trans-spatiality, language commodification, World Englishes and English as a Lingua Franca. Global English and Political Economy presents an original historical and interdisciplinary interpretation of the global ascent of English, while also raising important theoretical and practical questions for perspectives which suggest that the time of the traditional models of English is past.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nProviding an introduction to key theoretical perspectives in political economy, this book is essential reading for advanced students and researchers in applied linguistics, World Englishes and related fields of study.",

      "abstract": "This article explores how, in the quest for new global order, global governance might acquire greater sociological legitimacy. What are the sources of legitimacy in global governance? In other words, what conditions generate confidence and trust in global-scale authorities? To explore this question, the article first elaborates on the general concept of legitimacy as it relates to global regulation. Thereafter the discussion considers, under three main headings, a broad range of possible drivers of legitimacy beliefs vis-\u00e0-vis global governance. First, some of these sources are institutional, relating to features of the global regulatory organisations, such as their procedural inputs and their performance outputs. Second, other sources of legitimacy are individual, relating to the characteristics of the subjects of global governance, such as their identity orientations and their levels of social trust. Third, further sources of legitimacy in global governance are societal, relating to the general ordering patterns of world politics, such as prevailing norms, capitalism, and a hegemonic state. The article concludes by urging that researchers break from past habits of treating institutional, individual and societal sources of legitimacy separately and in isolation from each other. Instead, legitimacy in global governance can be more fully understood \u2013 and more effectively promoted in practice \u2013 if one examines these various forces together, and in terms of their mutual constitution.",

      "abstract": "In the postmodern world young people no longer accept the values advocated by the institutionalised church as unquestionably relevant to their lives, one of the reasons for this being that the supremacy of the Christian faith has given way to a secularised society. Public practical theology includes the public as one of its audiences. In this paper the point of departure is a reflection-theory and not the praxis as such. This theory focuses on everyday concerns and issues in order to facilitate a dialogue between theology and the social sciences. The article aims to reflect on the enhancement of the experience of transcendence in the everydayness of the present-day youth. It argues that the agency theories of Anthony Giddens and Pierre Bourdieu can provide a theoretical basis and method for public religious education.",

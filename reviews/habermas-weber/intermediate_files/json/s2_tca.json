      "abstract": "Private sector organizations work to make a profit, so their main goals should keep their organizational performance high. However, the main motivation of public organizations is efficiency, not productivity. Therefore, public organizations have displayed an image that is far from efficiency for a long time and organizational performance has not received enough attention. With the neo-liberal policies under the influence of public administration, public organizations adopted private sector principles and tried to increase their organizational performance. The study was prepared with reference to Max Weber's \u201crationalization theory\u201d and Habermas' \u201ccommunicative action theory\u201d with the assumption that the factors underlying the success of all organizations are based on rational actions and communication action phenomena. In this context, within the scope of the inquiry, the effect of communicative rational action on organizational performance and the moderating role of the sector (Private or public sector) in the relationship between communicative rational action and organizational performance were examined. For this aim, data were collected from 391 managers residing in the provinces of \u0130zmir, Manisa and, U\u015fak who are working in the private and public sectors. We used SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 24 statistics programs were used within the context of this study. Explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis, correlation, hierarchical regression and simple slope analysis are used to verify the hypotheses of the study. The findings indicate that rationality, value rational action, practical rational action, rational communication and firm family (stakeholders) have a positive effect on organizational performance, and the sector has a moderating role in the relations between value rational action-organizational performance, Firm Family (stakeholders)-organizational performance and rational communication-organizational performance. In this sense, while the positive relationship between value rational action-organizational performance and firm family(stakeholders)-organizational performance is stronger in the private sector, the positive relationship between rational communication-organizational performance is stronger in the public sector.",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

Through documentary and bibliographical research, it was possible to partially conclude that civil servants, teams or sectors should not perform functions in different phases of public expenditure, including and especially in phases that involve judgment and inspection; the principle of segregation of functions is also based on Weber's bureaucratic ideal type, in the sense that the specialization and expertise of the civil servant tends to increase the degree of precision and excellence of the activities carried out by him; This principle also finds support in Habermas' theory of communicative action.",

      "abstract": "Indonesia is a country whose government system is run with a democratic system. Pancasila, \u200ewhich is the foundation of the state, contains the principle of democracy. The main principle of \u200ethe Pancasila-style democracy is deliberation to reach a consensus based on noble knowledge \u200eand wisdom. This principle of deliberation is in line with Habermas's thesis of communicative \u200eaction but also has different implications. This paper compares the concept of deliberation-\u200econsensus ala Pancasila and Habermas's communicative action in implementing a democratic \u200esystem. This qualitative research analyzes data that includes historical literature, philosophy, and \u200escientific articles that discuss discourses related to Pancasila and Habermas's theory of \u200ecommunicative action. The study results show differences in Eastern and Western culture in the \u200etwo discourses. In Pancasila deliberation and consensus, communal ties are very strong, while \u200ethe value of Western individualism in rationalizing a discourse becomes the color of Habermas' \u200etheory.\u200e",

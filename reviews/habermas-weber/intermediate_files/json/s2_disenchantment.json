      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "We live in a contradictory world. Self-proclaimed \u201cskeptics,\u201d as the original meaning itself suggests, should first of all strive for scientific rationality, for reflective and objective distancing in the apprehension of reality, for methodological caution, and for an extensive ability to theoretically and philosophically understand intricate problems. In practice, too often there is entrenchment in dogmatic groups. Inquisitors endowed with an appearance of religious fanaticism, in the worst sense of the term, invest their energies in crusades of attacks against everyone to whom they attribute mistakes, na\u00efvete, or even bad intentions\u2014the universe of those who do not fit in their often restricted, idealized, and na\u00efve views of scientific practice. In those cases, there is hardly a possibility of frank dialogue, or openness to research fields outside preconceptions of what science and philosophy can approach and how they should operate. Researchers who dare to go beyond the limits some people establish for science and rationality can be disqualified as charlatans, backward, true believers, or superstitious. To substantiate their certainties, such self-proclaimed skeptics often claim to base their approach to science on examples given by highly regarded scientists and philosophers of the past. We speak here of scholars of the stature of Giordano Bruno, Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 35, No. 1, pp. 141\u2013154, 2021 0892-3310/21",

The book comprises eleven essays by contemporary academics related to the broad themes of Nandy \u2019 s work. In general, Nandy has linked \u2018 modernity \u2019 to a number of ills, including authoritar-ianism, disenchantment, lack of community, instrumental rationality, abstract compu-tational logic, violence and secular nationalism, a thematic preference marked by the Frankfurt School \u2014 one of Nandy \u2019 s major in \ufb02 uences \u2014 but which he takes in new direc-tions, exploring a colonial, psychological and Indian context. In this review essay, I brie \ufb02 y explore the premises behind Nandy \u2019 s project of creating an alternative to the secular nation-state, discuss the structure of the book and its individual contributions, and conclude with a discussion of the possibilities for his thought in the present. self that has been shaped by a hegemonic Western discourse. Nandy is preoccupied with demonstrating that such men partition their \u2018 selves \u2019 : they reinforce conventionalities in one sphere of life, allowing rationality to dominate there so that their fragile insights into the changing nature of the human predicament can be man-ifested elsewhere, without being overwhelmed by the conventionalities of a dominant dis-course ( \u2026 ) Nandy suspects that such partitionings come \u2018 more easily to the South Asian, traditionally accustomed to live in many cultures and, in fact, in many worlds \u2019 .

      "abstract": "The article deals with a role of mass culture in term of the theory of the culture industry by M. Horkheimer and T. Adorno and the theory of communicative action by J. Habermas, who continues research of the Frankfurt school. It is known that Habermas says about two types of rationality \u2014 communicative and structural. The lifeworld and the system correspond them. Usually, culture correspond to lifeworld because it helps people`s socialization. Also it is a place for communication and finding new meanings. However, a place of mass culture is very controver- sial. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish between popular and mass culture, because these definitions have been used as interchangeable for a long time. Popular culture is still an area of meanings. Moreover, it has the potential for protest. From this point of view, it is clearly part of the life world. But mass culture as a \u00abcultural industry\u00bb is not so unambiguous. It is worth considering its characteristics and role in people\u2019s life more detail. Above all, one cannot help paying attention to masses. Already in the last century, H. Arendt characterized them as an atomized and isolated group of people, and they are not united by any common ideas. After all, even in the modern world it is possible to see that they do not have and do not want to search for any ideas or meanings. Masses are a direct consumers of mass culture. It is consumerism that the characteristic feature of modernity. Therefore, mass culture is inseparably connected with the market. On the one hand, it sells entertainments, and on the other hand, it generates new consumers, because it is related to advertising. In the same way, mass culture is connected with agitation and propaganda. Thus, it is possible to speak about its connection with politics. The market and politics correspond to the system and are guided by strategic rationality. This fact gives reason to talk about mass culture as a strategic tool. Such culture with no meanings leads to a crisis in society.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the social and philosophical transformation of the mahalla institution a traditional form of neighborhood self-governance deeply rooted in Uzbek society in the context of modern state and civil society development. Drawing upon the theories of social solidarity (\u00c9. Durkheim), communicative rationality (J. Habermas), and social modernization (A. Giddens), the study analyzes how the mahalla system has evolved from a traditional moral community into a semi-formal structure integrated with state administration and civic participation. The author argues that Uzbekistan\u2019s mahalla model represents a unique synthesis between tradition and modernity, where local values, collective responsibility, and moral culture play a stabilizing role in social modernization. The philosophical significance of the mahalla system lies in its ability to preserve ethical coherence and social cohesion amid rapid political, digital, and cultural change.",

      "abstract": "Habermas\u2019 account of social identity is the most sophisticated among various deliberative and expansive democratic models and aligns with his long-standing theoretical commitment to communicative rationality that is tailored to the democratic organization of society. Taking a normative stance, he proposes a procedural account of social identity within communicative rationality, achievable only in modernity and deliberative democracy. We argue that his formulation of social identity is inadequate, given a problematic stage-based framework in his historical account of societal evolution and the insubstantial nature of social identity in his linguistic and procedural accounts of social identity. Nonetheless, Habermas\u2019 approach can serve as a starting point to develop a more inclusive and empirically defensible conceptual framework for collective identity, grounded in robust institutional foundations and a substantive account of the political. Finally, by challenging Habermas\u2019 separation of system and lifeworld, we argue that a rational social identity should be rooted in both domains.",

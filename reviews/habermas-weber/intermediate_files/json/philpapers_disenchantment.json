I then introduce definitions of key concepts (Hegelian alienation, Marxist alienation, Durkheimian anomie, and de-magification) to provide a more varied and precise vocabulary. This will aid in describing at least two different rationalization processes that can be derived from Webers theoretical framework (Economy and Society) and his historical studies.",

Finally, it is concluded that the term disenchantment is not a very useful concept for portraying Weber\u2019s intended view.",

      "abstract": "The key role and clarifying function of Verstehen in Weber's interpretive methodology, as one of the important and illuminating tools, is used by scientists to properly understand social science phenomena. Considering Weber's interpretive approach based on individualistic interpretation of actors' actions, we find that Verstehen, in Weber's view, serves as a tool for social scientists to uncover the causes behind actors' intentional actions. Understanding actors' intentions, influenced by Weber's interpretive methodological approach, employs all its effort in explaining social science phenomena to achieve objectivity. In this research, we have attempted to address the meaning and importance of Verstehen's role, stemming from Weber's and his predecessors' interpretive perspective, as a tool for interpreting social science phenomena. Considering Weber's project aimed at achieving objectivity in social sciences, it should be said that Verstehen, like ideal types and other components of Weber's methodological system, are pieces meant to be initiated and employed by scientists to attain objectivity in social and cultural sciences. This research strives to correctly interpret the role and significance of this component (Verstehen) within Weber's methodological system.",

      "abstract": "Max Weber\u2019s methodology is often treated by some as his principal contribution to social science, while his comparative sociology of religion starting with the famous Calvinist thesis is the Schwerpunkt in his work, according to others. There are several reasons to locate and analyze the conjunctions between these two interpretations. Weber\u2019s ideal type is formulated in several places, not only in the so-called \u2018Objectivity\u2019 essay from\u00a01904, but also for instance in the marginal utility-essay from\u00a01908. His three meta-texts for the three volumes in GARS (Gesammelte Aufsatze zur Religionssoziologie) are also illuminating, especially in \u2018Einleitung\u2019 (\u2018Introduction\u2019) and \u2018Zwischenbetrachtung\u2019 (or \u2018Intermediate Reflections\u2019). It was in the \u2018Zwischenbetrachtung\u2019 where he commented on religion in India, partly as an \u2018identity giving other\u2019, that the ideal type reappeared. Weber deals with the uniqueness of Occidental culture and his comparative religion serves as supporting evidence, much in line with J S Mill\u2019s canons for the logic of isolating independent variables by similarities and differences\u00a0-as indicated in a letter by Weber to Georg von Below. As a result Weber serves still today as a sparring partner for theorists of the Axial Age and the multi-modernity paradigm.",

Deconstructing the uniform mold of Structural Transformation\u2019s narrative about a rise and fall of the bourgeois public sphere in modernity also allows to identify and understand the ideology-critical methodologies of Habermas\u2019s theory reconstruction of Kant\u2019s ideal of the liberal public in the context of the French Revolution. \n Readers of this guide realize that Habermas\u2019s interpretation of a sociological and political category with the norms of constitutional theory and intellectual history causes the \u201ccollapsing of norm and description\u201d he acknowledged in 1989 and thus frequent misunderstandings about the historical validity of Structural Transformation\u2019s ideal-type derived from Condorcet\u2019s absolute rationalism and Kant\u2019s \u201cunofficial\u201d philosophy of history. Specifically, the guide explains that Habermas\u2019s key construct of a \u201cmorally pretentious rationality\u201d of the bourgeois public sphere entirely depends on the claim about \u201cnatural laws\u201d harmoniously regulating the economy. While neoliberalism still maintains this claim, Hegel \u201cdecisively destroyed\u201d it already in 1821.",

In a second moment, the paper interpret, with Vandenberghe (2011), the bourdieusian epistemology as a type of sophisticated synthesis between the Bachelard\u201fs racionalism and the Cassier\u201fs relationshipism. In the conclusion, the paper defends the thesis that both weberian epistemology and Bourdieu\u201fs resource of the \u201cphilosophy as if\u201d must be interpreted through the realistic presupposition of the scientific (re)descriptions can correspond (in variable measurements) to the empirical reality.

In order to clarify the theoretical framework, I suggest a comparative reading with The City in Economy and Society. The theoretical framework of Ancient Judaism can be viewed as an ideal type, 'Israel and Greece'. The ideal type is related with the religious and the political accordingly. Moreover, these are thought of as ambivalent. Observing the concept 'the ethic of ultimate ends and the ethic of responsibility', we can see the sharpened tension between the religious and the political. Certainly, this view would be effected by the severe situation in Germany during and right after the First World War. In spite of that, the work still has some significance in the history of philosophy, especially in Weber's integration of methodologies to interpret complicated social phenomena.",

His concept of understanding (Verstehen) gained a modified role in the sociological theoretical-methodological directions that emerged during the twentieth century. Understanding is not only a methodological procedure of interpreting social reality but also a condition of its intersubjectivity as a special experiential form. Therefore, in this paper, the theoretical schemes and methodological strategies of Max Weber and Alfred Sch\u00fctz are problematised with the central attention to the use of the postulate of subjective interpretation. This postulate is presented within the phenomenological sociological model, primarily in the sense of the general principle of constructing types of flow-actions, that is, the typification necessary for social harmonisation of participants in the common-sense world. Since the model of scientific constructs is based on the model of common sense constructs as first-order constructs, this postulate also gained its central place in the methodological sense, as one of three possible forms - experiential, epistemological, and methodological. In the wake of all previously analysed, the specificity of the phenomenological understanding of the concept of action is also pointed out.",

Analyzing the content of recent discussions about the empirical validity and character of Weber\u2019s argumentation in one of his central works, The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism, as well as about the autonomy and conceptual boundaries of Weber\u2019s science, we draw a line of reasoning as follows. Firstly, we trace the changing of the methodological role of values in general, and the value of truth, in particular, in the \u201csciences of culture\u201d in connection with the transition from the transcendental solution of Heinrich Rickert to Weber\u2019s \u201cvalue polytheism\u201d. Secondly, we analyze how the relationship between Weber\u2019s science, progress, and rationalization is structured. Thirdly, we explicate the mode of \u201cvocation\u201d in science, relying on the logical-methodological foundations proposed by Weber. Fourthly, we identify the development of Weber\u2019s idea of the value autonomy of science. It is shown that Weber rejects the criterion of truth\u2019s universality proposed by Rickert\u2019s logical solution. However, the construction of ideal-typical concepts and the mechanics of \u201ccognitive interest\u201d described by Weber allows scientists to separate extra-scientific pragmatics from the scientific research itself. The progress of the \u201csciences of culture\u201d for Weber is the differentiation and the emergence of new research approaches and the refinement of concepts. At the same time, science is not teleologically connected with \u201cprogress in general\u201d and the rationalizing world, the configuration of which is a specific historical constellation. As associated with scientific work, \u201cgaining the clarity\u201d turns out to be not its own goal, but a possible effect of using scientific knowledge. The mode of \u201cvocation\u201d in a \u201cvalue polytheism\u201d situation forces scientists to contribute to the endless scientific progress; they formulate such ideal-types and causal explanations that seem adequate and sufficient from the point of view of their cognitive interests. The stability of science\u2019s boundaries and its value autonomy are formed in Weber\u2019s theory gradually; epistemological studies and the implementation of his sociology of the religion research \u201cprogramme\u201d make the difference between vocations in science and politics clear.",

      "abstract": "The book \"Alfred Schutz: Mainstreaming Phenomenology in the Tradition of Social Sciences\" discusses the figure of Schutz regarding his phenomenological methodology which is not widely discussed in the academic world. Schutz himself is an important philosopher and sociologist because of his theory in sociology and philosophy studies. In the world of philosophy, he is a figure who studies the Husserlian tradition of phenomenology. Meanwhile, in the world of sociology himself, Schutz chose to explore Weber's methodological project. With the methodology proposed by Weber, he seeks to develop an interpretive methodology as an attempt to counter the tendency of the positivism tradition of science. The book was written to provide a discussion of the phenomenological methodology by Schutzian, which Schutz pioneered. Through his methodology, he taught that every individual is present in the stream of consciousness obtained from the process of reflecting on daily experiences. This book focuses on explaining the phenomenological methodology by Schutzian which later can become a reference for academics in Indonesia in developing the Schutzian methodology for Indonesian academics. In addition, this book also introduces Alfred Schutz as a critical intellectual who is not widely known, but whose thoughts and contributions have an impact on the world of social science.This book is written and aimed at Indonesian academics, especially in the realm of philosophy and sociology. Although the name Schutz himself lost to other philosophers, he had a very large contribution in the fields of philosophy and sociology, especially for science in Indonesia. The methodology adopted by Schutz has inspired many academics to read reality. It is evident from the many studies in Indonesia that use the phenomenology of the Schutz methodology. This phenomenology is used to read reality in society. As in research conducted by Ristia (2020), it was found that people have different opinions, this is due to the influence of the applied norms. These different opinions become absolute and become freedom by each individual. Research using the Schutz phenomenology method can also be used to explore types of phenomenology and ethnography. Research in the genre of \"transcendental phenomenology\" is a phenomenon outside the egos of the researcher because the source of truth can be obtained by direct observation of the natural surroundings. The author presents a biography of Alfred Schutz, who was a unique and influential intellectual but little known. The introduction of the background, politics, and culture in Schutz can inspire readers to get inspiration on Schutz's life. In addition, by knowing his background, readers will be able to analyze how a Schutz gets his thoughts. Apart from the history of Schutz's travels, its also provides a brief biography of Husserll. Husserll himself was an influential figure who influenced Schutz's thinking, he himself had the aim of building a scientific basis for philosophy and phenomenology in social science. Schutz's thoughts on phenomenology did not stop there, especially regarding sociology. Schutz's ideas were also continued by his students, such as Schutz himself who inherited knowledge from Husserll. Peter Berger and Luckmann, Schutz's students who could be said to shine were also briefly discussed in this book. They are both known for their work entitled The Social Construction of Reality, which is a work inspired by Schutz. Apart from the two of them, George Psathas, a Schutz student, will also be discussed briefly. Psathas himself prefers to discuss empirical studies in phenomenology which will later be useful for building knowledge about individuals in the subjective world.The book is very important for many people to know, because Alfred Schutz himself was an intellectual who was quite influential in the development of sociology for both the western and non-western worlds (such as Indonesia). The phenomenological study put forward by Schutz itself is a study that can be used by academics, especially sociologists to examine cases and realities in society. Indonesian sociologists and anthropologists can also apply Schutz's methodology and phenomenology studies to research Indonesian society. Indonesian academics have the opportunity to contribute to the scientific space globally to continue developing Schutz's ideas and thoughts. By reading the book, academics and readers will get inspiration from Schutz's thoughts that have been described. Indonesian academics have the opportunity to be involved in global academic activities. So that it is the right choice for academics (social science) to read and implement the knowledge that has been obtained into existing cases and realities.",

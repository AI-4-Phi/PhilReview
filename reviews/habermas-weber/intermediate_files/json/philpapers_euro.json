        "This essay highlights the theoretical relations between Weber, Jaspers and Eisenstadt on the issue of the axial age and modernity. For Weber Modernity is an \u201caxial age\u201d but also an event in the history of Western rationalization. So we can\u2019t say which is his idea on this topic.",

        "Modernity can\u2019t be an \u201caxial age\u201d because it took place in the West and only after in these three civilizations. For Eisenstadt, on the contrary, modernity is a second \u201caxial age\u201d. He thinks the XX and the XXI century as an era of multiple modernities."

      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this paper is to compare the theories of Yamazaki Masakazu und J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Yamazaki believed that the hard, ascetic individualism with a focus on production would alienate us from our humanity. He saw in a slowed down consumption a way out of this regressive development. Habermas on the other hand believed that system-oriented rationalization process would colonize the communication-oriented lifeworld. This negative trend could be overcome by developing a discourse free of power interference that enables consensus-building. This gentle individualism of Yamazaki and Habermas corresponds to a compromise between the extremes of a hard individualism (capitalism) and collectivism (communism or nationalism). The surprising result of the analysis is that Yamazaki\u2019s theory is not only easier to realize than Habermas\u2019s, but also more universally applicable.",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

The argument is structured in three stages: in a first, the habermasian understanding of the distinction between pre-modern and modern is presented as a transition from the undifferentiated to the differentiated, more particularly from the mythical reification to the uncoupling of system and lifeworld; in a second, it presents its definition of modern reification as systemic colonization of the lifeworld; finally, it demonstrates how his theory of dual rationalization is also an investigation of the foundations for a normative defense of decolonization/autonomization of the lifeworld as an emancipatory horizon, which will even lead him to abandon, in the course of his work, the very tradition of the critique of reification.",

Patients\u2019 organizations represent an important link between individual patients and the health system. Social theories are increasingly being used to explain doctor\u2013patient\u2013system interactions, expanding understanding beyond the mere clinical perspective. In this sense, patient involvement in HTA can also be considered through the Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action. From a Habermasian perspective, HTA as part of the instrumental rationality contributes to an increased efficiency of resource use within the system; however, such rationalization threatens to colonize the lifeworld by making it \u201cincreasingly state administered with attenuated possibilities for communicative action as a result of the commercialization and rationalization in terms of immediate returns.\u201d Using Habermasian system/lifeworld framework, this paper explores opportunities and obstacles to patient involvement in HTA, whereby trying to understand current and possible roles of patients\u2019 organizations as a mediating force between HTA as a function of the system and the lifeworld represented by patients.",

First Adair-Toteff summarizes the general meaning concerning the rationalization in the concept of Weber by reflecting critically on the most important authors. Secondly, Hans Joas followed historically the genealogy and the inherent dynamic of the term and idea of \u201eEntzauberung\u201d (disenchantment). He focuses on the central question of sociology of religion, whether it is possible to describe and analyze the role of religion in modern societies by employing the Weberian concepts of disenchantment and rationalization. Thirdly and lastly, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, similarly to Jonas, offers an alternative understanding of the linear process of secularization and rationalization. We hope that through the examination of the three different receptions have contributed to the contemporary discourse concerning Weber\u2019s theory of religion in Hungary.",

      "abstract": "In this research work, Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories are textually analyzed using a Habermasian lens. Manto's ideas on female subordination, societal supremacy, and freedom are stressed in this paper. The main goal of this qualitative study is to demonstrate the applicability of Manto's discovery in the modern day within the context of Habermas' critical social theory. This study illustrates unequivocally how social institutions' instrumental rationality colonizes and rationalizes the lifeworld. According to Habermas, societal structures like political and economic systems are encroaching on our daily lives. He is worried about the lines separating the lifeworld and the system. Additionally, Habermas' realistic objective for critical theory is for human liberty to be unhindered by any superfluous shackles. The short stories of Saadat Hasan Manto are drawn from Mottled Dawn: Fifty Sketches and Stories of Partition translated by Khalid Hasan and Manto's Selected Short Stories translated by Aatish Taseer. According to the study's findings, Manto and Habermas both reject social structures that oppress people and exert unjust dominance or colonization. The goal of maximizing human emancipation is shared by both. According to the results of the textual analysis, Manto's characters like Saughandi, Nesti, Raadha, and Mozail do not accept submission and advocate for independence from ideological, political, and social restraints. Keywords: Life world and System, instrumental rationality, social structures, domination, emancipation",

Starting from the view that the ethics that organizations display in practice will have been forged through an ongoing process of debate and contestation over moral choices, we examine ethics in relation to the ambiguous, unpredictable, and subjective contexts of managerial action. Furthermore, we examine how discursively constituted practice relates to managerial subjectivity and the possibilities of managers being moral agents. The article concludes by discussing how the \u2018ethics as practice\u2019 approach that we expound provides theoretical resources for studying the different ways that ethics manifest themselves in organizations as well as providing a practical application of ethics in organizations that goes beyond moralistic and legalistic approaches.",

      "abstract": "\"In their study of social practices deemed traditional, scholars tend to use the concept and idea of tradition as an element of meaning in the practices under investigation. But just whose meaning is it? Is it a meaning generated by those who study tradition or those whose traditions are being studied? In both cases, particular criteria for traditionality are employed, whether these are explicated or not. Individuals and groups will no doubt continue to uphold their traditional practices or refer to their practices as traditional. While they are in no way obliged to explicate in analytical terms their criteria for traditionality, the same cannot be said for those who make the study of traditions their profession. In scholarly analysis, traditions need to be explained instead of used as explanations for apparent repetitions and replications or symbolic linking in social practice, values, history, and heritage politics. This book takes a closer look at \u2018tradition\u2019 and \u2018folklore\u2019 in order to conceptualize them within discourses on modernity and modernism. The first section discusses \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 as modern concepts and the study of folklore as a modern trajectory. The underlying tenet here is that non-modernity cannot be represented without modern mediation, which therefore makes the representations of non-modernity epistemologically modern. The second section focuses on the nation-state of Finland and the nationalistic use of folk traditions in the discursive production of Finnish modernity and its Others. The insights are applicable worldwide in discussions on cultural representation. \"",

Feminism and constructivism share a commitment to an ontology of becoming that can serve as a common basis for conversation. Yet there are also profound differences between feminists and constructivists. First, most IR feminists approach gender and power as integral elements in processes of construction, whereas most constructivists consider power to be external to such processes. This failure to conceptualize power and gender as social and pervasive leads constructivists to miss an important part of the empirical reality of power politics. Second, constructivists tend to ignore the implications of a postpositivist epistemology, whereas for feminists the question of \"Who knows?\" is crucial. We argue that the constructivist failure to problematize the research process as a social (and therefore political) process of construction is logically inconsistent with an ontology of becoming. We introduce empirical materials to illustrate the advantages of feminist approaches. We hope to advance a dialogue between feminism and constructivism because the two approaches add to each other and in combination can yield better theoretical and empirical understandings of the world.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract This paper provides a criticial interpretation of the theme, point, and methodological status of Adorno's so\u2010called negative dialectic. The theme at issue, 'non\u2010identity', comes in several varieties; and the point of Adorno's dialectic, namely reconciliation, is multifaceted. Exploration of those topics shows that negative dialectic seques into substantive doctrines, including a version of transcendentalism and a claim about deformation. The peculiar methodological status of negative dialectic explains that adumbration. In the appraisive register, my principal contentions include these: Adorno's transcendentalism makes some sense of the aforementioned deformation claim; and negative dialectic qua method avoids mystery and metaphysical excess. Keywords: negative dialecticAdornononidentityreconciliationdeformation Notes \u2217 Several anonymous referees helped to improve this paper. My thanks also to Peter Dews, Fabian Freyenhagen, and Timo Juetten, none of whom should be construed as holding my views. 1 Recent work on Adorno upon which I shall draw includes the books by Bernstein (2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), O'Connor (2004 O'Connor, Brian. 2004. Adorno's Negative Dialectic: Philosophy and the Possibility of Critical Rationality, Cambridge, Mass. and London: MIT Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), and Cook (2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). However, and as will become evident, what follows does not attempt anything like a full engagement with those works. 2 I shall focus upon ND's Introduction and second part. The latter's title is 'Negative Dialektik. Begrif fund Kategorien'. The Begriff is negative dialectic. The Kategorien are notions, such as 'the transcendental' and the concept of dialectic itself, that are to 'retained as well as qualitatively altered' (ND xx; cf. LND 62f., 101,121). I give no special attention to ND's last part. For that part comprises 'models' of negative dialectic; and those models intertwine negative dialectic with its results (q.v. \u00a74 below) especially tightly. I shall draw freely upon Adorno's lecture courses. Those courses somewhat relax Adorno's heterodox style and his suspicion of what he calls (H 98) the Klarheitsideal. On that ideal, and for an argument that treatments of Adorno can and even should overrule that suspicion, see Joll, 2009 Joll, Nicholas. 2009. 'How Should Philosophy Be Clear? Loaded Clarity, Default Clarity, and Adorno'. Telos, 146(Spring 2009): 73\u201395. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]. 3 In Adorno and Hegel alike \u2013 and Adorno inherits the notions of universal, particular, and mediation from Hegel \u2013 'mediation' translates Vermittlung (a term that Ashton's ND renders as 'transmission'), 'universal' das Allgemeine, and 'particular' das Besondere. But Hegel also uses Partikular for 'particular'. 4 \u00a73 treats non\u2010identity. \u00a74 considers how Adorno's dialectic is negative in a sense beyond that of involving items that somehow oppose or negate each other. One sees here that that my short list of 'fundamentals' excludes features important to negative dialectic. But one has to start somewhere (compare LND 25). More problematic is Adorno's claim that dialectic lacks a foundation (ND xix; Grundlage), that it 'cannot be maintained as a structure that will stay basic no matter how it is modified' (ND 136). \u00a74 tries to both to diffuse and to explain that point. 5 The modality ('can all be \u2026') suggests a point that Adorno, who at one point glosses mediation as 'entanglement in context' (ND 106), would seem to accept. To wit: what counts as a universal or a particular will vary with context or interest. 6 The presupposition here is that everything is (or can be \u2013 see the previous note) either a universal or a particular. 7 'Dialectic is the consistent consciousness of nonidentity [Nichtidentit\u00e4t].' 8 '[T]he continuing irreconcilability of subject and object [\u2026] constitutes the theme of dialectical criticism.' 9 \u00a73 considers how objective mediation might go awry. Some statements (ND 6, 312; LND 16, 165) suggest that, anyway, mismediation by universals of particulars is more important for Adorno than the mismediation of universals by particulars. 10 \u00a72.1 fleshes out the idea of inadequacy, albeit in a restricted context. Adorno also says (ND, part 2, passim; LND 7f) that universals can 'contradict' particulars. 11 Can the author of Zur Metakritik der Erkenntnistheorie consistently hold, or be imputed, epistemological opinions? Adorno rejected epistemology because he identified it with first philosophy (see \u00a72.3). Yet it is unclear that Adorno's first\u2010philosophical sense of epistemology encompasses all that plausibly counts as theory of knowledge. For presumably Adorno would not so indict his own view that to know is to identify. His position may be that his views about knowledge escape (first\u2010philosophical) epistemology because they are conceived, as first\u2010philosophical ideas are not, as historically relative. Certainly he held a difficult doctrine whereby truth has a 'temporal core' (see for example M 45). Adorno's ideas about knowledge in utopia may seem to accord with such a doctrine. But \u00a73.1 will suggest that those ideas comprise an account, although a minimal one, of genuine knowledge. 12 For reading 1, see: Osborne, 1989 Osborne, Peter. 1989. \"'Adorno and the Metaphysics of Modernism: The Problem of a \"Postmodern\" Art'\".

(but note that 'particularity thesis' is my term). Jay Bernstein, from whom I take reading 2, construes the density thesis as a qualified version of conceptualism that betters the unqualified version by recognizing the density of experience.

Routledge: London and New York. [Google Scholar]: pp. 220\u20132ff. One might count as a third reading an inflection \u2013 a radicalization \u2013 of the first reading. I have in mind the view that the Adornian non\u2010identical is something ineffable. Finlayson, 2002 Finlayson, James Gordon. 2002. 'Adorno on the Ethical and the Ineffable'. European Journal of Philosophy, 101(April): 1\u201325. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] is a developed version of such a view. 13 For the new reading, see Hammer, 2000 Hammer, Espen. 2000.

Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 102f. (which defends the received reading and the idea it imputes). One should admit, I think, that the new reading is somewhat reconstructive. For Adorno does stress a kind of incommensurability between thought and its objects (see especially LND). Relatedly, he tends to confuse predication with identification (see esp. LND 8 and cf. Geuss 1975 Geuss, Raymond. 1975. 'Negative Dialectics'. Journal of Philosophy, LXXII(6): 167\u201375. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 172f. and Schn\u00e4delbach 2007 Schn\u00e4delbach, Herbert. 2007. \"'The dialectical critique of reason: Adorno's construction of rationality'\". In Theodor W. Adorno. Critical Evaluations in Cultural Theory, Edited by: Jarvis, Simon. Vol. 1, London and New York: Routledge. (2007) [Google Scholar]: p. 159). 14 'Identity thinking says what something comes under, what it exemplifies or represents, and what, accordingly, it is not itself' (ND 149). 'The moment of nonidentity in the identifying judgment is immediately understandable insofar as each individual object subsumed under a class has determinations not contained in the definition of the class' (ND 150). 15 Some echoes: Wittgenstein (1975 Wittgenstein, Ludwig. 1975. The Blue and Brown Books: Preliminary Studies for the 'Philosophical Investigations', Oxford: Blackwell. [Google Scholar]: pp. 17\u201319) diagnosed a philosophical 'craving for generality'; William James maintained that 'something always escapes' (1987 James, William. 1987. Writings 1902\u20131910, New York: Library of America. [Google Scholar]: p. 776). 16 A further argument (H 9, M 47\u201356, and 71, S 267) tries to use the idea of conceptual holism against first philosophy. Adorno's notion of 'constellation' (on which one may see Stone, 2008 Stone, Alison. 2008. \"'Adorno and Logic'\". In Theodor Adorno: Key Concepts, Edited by: Cook, Deborah. 47\u201362. Stocksfield, , UK: Acumen. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) suggests such holism. But I am unclear about the details of Adorno's argument. 17 Loux (2002 Loux, Michael J. 2002. Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction , 2nd edn, London and New York: Routledge. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 9 and Ch. 7) uses the epithet 'conceptual schemers' to refer to Quine, Putnam, and Rorty. See also Goodman (1984 Goodman, Nelson. 1984. Of Mind and Other Matters, Cambridge, Mass. and London: Harvard University Press. [Google Scholar]: p. 36): 'Now as we thus make constellations by picking out and putting together certain stars rather than others, so we make stars by drawing certain boundaries rather than others. Nothing dictates whether the sky shall be marked off into constellations or other objects. We have to make what we find, be it the Great Dipper, Sirius, food, fuel, or a stereo system.' 18 Vogel, 1996 Vogel, Steven. 1996. \"'Reification and the Nonidentical: On the Problem of Nature in Luk\u00e1cs and Adorno'\". In Phenomenology, Interpretation and Community, Edited by: Stephen, Lenore Langsdorf, Watson, H. and Marya Bower, E. 253\u2013268. New York: State University of New York Press. [Google Scholar]: p. 262; Rosen, 1982 Rosen, Michael. 1982. Hegel's Dialectic and its Criticism, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 104f. Adorno himself has this worry about Kant. Note further that the 'scheme' at issue extends from concepts to other interests or orientations: to our sociality and our animality. 19 Habermas (1992 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1992. Postmetaphysical Thinking: Philosophical Essays, Edited by: Hohengarten, William Mark. Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: pp. 3\u201351 and passim) defines post\u2010metaphysical thinking as thinking that eschews both any strong form of naturalism and Platonistic commitments. (McDowell's Mind and World uses the notion of 'bald naturalism' to characterize the type of strong naturalism that is at issue here.) Habermas holds that, by dint of his remaining within 'the philosophy of consciousness', Adorno is still metaphysical. Hammer, 2000 Hammer, Espen. 2000. 'Minding the World: Adorno's Critique of Idealism'. Philosophy and Social Criticism, 26(1): 71\u201392. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar] analyses the imputed paradigm and denies that Adorno fits it. 20 On 'late capitalism', see Cook 2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 11\u201317. For the view about how animality affects our thinking, see: SO 504; DE 26f., 187\u20139; MM \u00a779; Adorno, 1984 Adorno, Theodor W. 1984. \"'The Idea of Natural History'\". In Telos Edited by: Hullot\u2010Kentor, R. Vol. 60, 111\u201324. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]. Freud considerably influences Adorno's thoughts on self\u2010preservation. 21 As is scientism, construed as the view that 'all knowledge can potentially be converted to science' (Adorno, 1991 Adorno, Theodor W. 1991. Notes to Literature, Edited by: Nicholsen, Shierry Weber. Vol. 1, New York: Columbia University Press. [Google Scholar]: p. 8). Adorno rejects that view thus: 'The object of undiminished experience is more objective [than] the indeterminate substrate of reductionism' (CM 250; cf. esp. KCPR 25 and ME 15). 22 Arguably, indeed, 'Adorno's philosophy is best seen as an inflection of Weber's analysis of disenchantment and societal rationalization' (Bernstein, 2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 30). 23 See DE 20 and, for instance, AT 4, MM 239, and ND 11 and 161. 24 One glimpses here that Adorno 'refunctions' ontology too. 'Ontology is to be concretely and historically radicalized' (Adorno, 1984 Adorno, Theodor W. 1984. \"'The Idea of Natural History'\". In Telos Edited by: Hullot\u2010Kentor, R. Vol. 60, 111\u201324. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 121). For Adorno's attack on (un\u2010refunctioned) ontology as first philosophy, see especially ME 8 and 19. 25 Since Adorno deems 'enlightenment' 'a restricted reason' (ND 317; see also esp. CM 148ff.), the deformation claim does not indict reason as such. Still: Adorno's anti\u2010Platonism \u2013 his Hegelianism, Marxism, and even (see LND, passim) empiricism \u2013 commits him to denying any reality, or at least efficacy, to a reason lacking all actualization. This may be why he speaks of his allegiance to enlightenment as a 'petitio principii' (DE xvi). Yet Adorno believes that a reason more worthy of the name has some actuality (see \u00a73.2). To that extent, the charge that Adorno attacks the very reason that his attack employs (see esp. Habermas, 1987 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1987. The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures, Edited by: Lawrence, Frederick. Cambridge: Polity. [Google Scholar]: pp. 119ff. and 1984: pp. 384\u20136) is awry. Bernstein (2001 Bernstein, Jay M. 2001. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, 217\u2013245. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 266f.) and O'Connor (2004 O'Connor, Brian. 2004. Adorno's Negative Dialectic: Philosophy and the Possibility of Critical Rationality, Cambridge, Mass. and London: MIT Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 165\u201370), inter alios, provide similar rebuttals to Habermas's charge. 26 'Exchange' (Tausch) in Adorno abbreviates 'the exchange relationship' (Tauschverh\u00e4lt) or 'exchange process' (Tauschvorgang). In what follows, I mean to improve upon what I regard as the best extant accounts of the Adorno\u2013Luk\u00e1cs relation, namely those provided by Habermas (1984 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1984. \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". In Reason and the Rationalization of Society, Edited by: McCarthy, Thomas. Vol. 1, Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: Ch. 4) and Cook (2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: pp. 39\u201349). 27 That Adorno accepts the ideas of mystery and fetishism is evident (ND 140, 178, 315; ME 37ff.; MM 239; H 126; S 270). However, some of his uses of 'reification' (Verdinglichung) impute what I (and Cook \u2013 see 2004 Cook, Deborah. 2004. Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society, Routledge: London and New York. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: p. 45) call commodification. See, for instance, MM 228ff. 28 I have corrected a typographical error in Luk\u00e1cs, 1922 Luk\u00e1cs, Georg. 1922. History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics, Edited by: Livingstone, Rodney. Manchester: Merlin Press, 1971. [Google Scholar]. 29 Habermas uses the phrase 'rationalisation\u2010as\u2010reification' (1984 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1984. \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". In Reason and the Rationalization of Society, Edited by: McCarthy, Thomas. Vol. 1, Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: p. 339) to impute broadly the same idea(s) to Luk\u00e1cs. 30 See, e.g., Habermas, 1984 Habermas, J\u00fcrgen. 1984. \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". In Reason and the Rationalization of Society, Edited by: McCarthy, Thomas. Vol. 1, Oxford: Polity. [Google Scholar]: p. 355. Adorno, too, takes Luk\u00e1cs this way (see the next note). 31 True, Adorno does not use 'reification' and cognates to mean reifying rationalization. Sometimes, indeed, he seems to reject even that latter idea. First, he faults Luk\u00e1cs's doctrine of reification for idealism (ND 191f.). But one can retain Luk\u00e1csian reifying rationalization, even in an ontological version, while limiting the dependence reality has on thought. The same stretch of ND seemingly downplays the importance of reification. But close reading suggests that Adorno does not downplay Luk\u00e1csian reification (reifying rationalization). Finally: Luk\u00e1cs takes exchange as model and cause of reification, whereas Adorno traces deformation to thought. But Adorno connects exchange very closely to thought. On that point, see what follows in the main text. See also: IS 15f., 31, 64f.; S 270; KCPR 174. See additionally \u2013 on the admittedly strange idea that society influences what there is not only through concepts but somehow as, or analogously to, a concept \u2013 IS 32 and 37. 32 KCPR 176, DE 167, MM 69f., and ND 56 make comparable claims. 33 'The reconciled condition would not be the philosophical imperialism of annexing the alien. Instead, its happiness would lie in the fact that the alien, in the proximity it is granted, remains what is distant and different, beyond the heterogeneous and beyond that which is one's own' (ND 191; see also ND 10). 34 'The formulation \"negative dialectic\" offends against tradition. As early as Plato, dialectic intended to produce something positive through the intellectual means of negation; the figure of a \"negation of negation\" came to name this succinctly. This book would like to free dialectics from such affirmativity without reducing its determinacy' (ND xix). On the contrasts that Adorno perceives between his dialectic and Hegel's, see esp. H and LND. Sherratt (2002 Sherratt, Yvonne. 2002. Adorno's Positive Dialectic, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) argues that Adorno's dialectic is positive in that it involves normative models of knowledge and of the self. I do not quite disagree. But the present section argues that Adorno's account of such a reconciled state is minimal. 35 See ND 51, 124, 277. Adorno (ND 207) likens his prohibition to 'the theological ban on images'. The Marxian idea of utopia has always understood itself as the reappropriation of 'alienated' religious hopes. But Benjamin influences Adorno here too. 36 If not in name; only ND 147\u201351 uses the term rationale Identit\u00e4t. 37 Adorno does seem to hold that art, or more precisely philosophical interpretation of some modernist art, can anticipate a better world to a greater degree than can philosophy alone. See esp. AT 73, 132, 227 and, for commentary, Osborne, 1989 Osborne, Peter. 1989. \"'Adorno and the Metaphysics of Modernism: The Problem of a \"Postmodern\" Art'\". In The Problems of Modernity: Adorno and Benjamin, Edited by: Benjamin, Andrew. 23\u201348. London and New York: Routledge. [Google Scholar]. 38 Adorno does impart two further, minimal, points. (1) Reconciliation involves the satisfaction of basic needs (ND 303f., MM 155f., AT 33). (2) Social reconciliation would involve the absence of reification (commodification, reifying rationalization) and the transformation of commodity exchange (ND 146f.). 39 'Es gibt kein richtiges Leben im falschen' (MM 39 / GS4 43). On this conception, and on the ethical dimension to Adorno's thought more generally, see, in the first instance, Freyenhagen, 2008 Freyenhagen, Fabian. 2008. \"'No Easy Way Out: Adorno's Negativism and the Problem of Normativity'\". In Nostalgia for a Redeemed Future: Critical Theory, Edited by: Ludovisi, S. Giacchetti. 39\u201350. Newark, Del: University of Delaware Press. [Google Scholar]. 40 This is the sense (see n. 4 above) in which dialectic 'cannot be maintained as a structure that will stay basic no matter how it is modified'. 41 In claiming (1976: p. 9) that 'dialectics does not accede to the criterion of the definition but instead criticises it', Adorno intends also the idea that dialectic identifies forms of non\u2010identity and thus, in various ways, reveals deficiencies to definitions. See also ND 141. 42 ND 164f. compares dialectic to Weber's procedure with ideal types.

It views social theorists as intellectuals who try to understand the crisis of their times. In doing so, they draw not only upon the cognitive resources of earlier social theories but upon the structured traditions of cultural codes and narratives. In order to explain the new and often unnerving experiences of their changing societies, intellectuals develop binary oppositions whose constructions of sacrality and profanity allow them to place the present in relation to a simplified past and future, thus creating \u201chistory.\u201d Social theory is also built upon changing narrative forms, genres of collective heroism, romantic individualism, tragedy, comedy, realism, and irony. The author suggests that in recent years the comic and ironic perspectives of postmodern theory have been challenged by a neo-modern perspective that is more heroic and romantic and more confident about solving the \u201cproblems of our time.\u201d",

      "abstract": "We live at a time of renewed historical consciousness-in part due to the events in the former \"East,\" in part due to two decades of millennial pronouncements by many in the humanities and social sciences. Many declare that something called \"Western modernity\" has reached its culmination, and is either irrevocably disintegrating or is in urgent need of reconstruction. This way of talking, however, tends to conflate several centuries of intellectual history, failing to specify which \"modernity\" is at issue. In this essay, I will suggest that we can gain useful insight on current legal and cultural debates by situating ourselves in relation to that period of early twentieth-century intellectual history known as \"Modernism,\" that phase of the history of \"modernity\" which has most shaped our own intellectual condition.\\nSpecifically, I will discuss the relationship between certain broad characteristics of Modernist cultural renewal and the changes wrought in international law by various legal writers between the World Wars. This juxtaposition of forms of law with other forms of culture should not be viewed as a claim of a direct correlation or \"influence,\" but, rather, as indicating an overlapping series of responses to a common cultural situation. The juxtaposition suggests that transformations in legal thought can be productively viewed as participating in, and, indeed, partly creating, deep shifts in Western cultural history. The most important of such shifts in the first decades of our century, I would argue, was the advent of the central Modernist problematic: the paradoxical relationship between \"primitivism\" and experimentalism, a problematic that gave rise to a range of responses both among and within various cultural domains.",

This paper explores attempts by the far right to co-opt two particular music scenes: black metal and English folk. Discourse tracing is used to explore online debates about boundaries, belonging and exclusion in the two scenes, and to compare such online debates with ethnographic work and previous research. It is argued that both scenes have differently resisted the far right through the policing of boundaries and communicative choices, but both scenes are compromised by their relationship to myths of whiteness and the instrumentality of the pop music industry.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to show the centrality the concept of progress occupies explicitly and implicitly in social theory, in relation to the theorization and understanding of modernity; it also raises the question whether in times where Eurocentrism, logocentrism and indeed almost every claim of supremacy are rightly viewed with suspicion, it is possible to think of modernity without relying on some interpretation of the notion of progress. Arguably, the theme of progress, together with the complementary notion of decline, can be considered as a key-component of discourses concerning modernity and has played a major role in the shaping of social theory. Comte and Durkheim relied in different ways in the idea of progress and the same holds for Marxist accounts of social change. Even later sociological theories address modernity from the perspective of progress, Parsons being exemplary in this respect. Moreover, theoretical discourses adopting a critical or even hostile attitude against the modern project often question the idea of progress and are woven around the representation of modernity in terms of decline and regression into unreason, as e.g. Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enightment. Arguably, the imagery of progress informs the distinction between society and community, which is also hidden behind Habermas's more recent theorization of societies in terms of systems and lifeworlds. Finally, the question regarding the possibility of partially disentangling the theorization of modernity from the idea of progress, is pursued via a critical assessment of Eisenstadt's multiple modernities and Wagner's theorization of modernity in terms of responses given to basic probl\u00e9matiques.",

Authority legitimates claims, which is why claim-makers have always sought its validation. An exploration into the historical dimension of the social construction of authority provides insight into changing foundations on which claims about social problems are made. In contrast to the Middle Ages, the modern era has found it difficult to gain consensus on the meaning of authority. This historical shift in the status of authority provides the context for contemporary competitive claims-making about social problems.",

      "abstract": "The twentieth-century obsession with meaning often fails to address the central questions: Why are we here? Where are we going? In this radical critique of modernity, Eugene (Rochberg-) Halton resurrects pragmatism, pushing it beyond its traditional formulations to meet these questions head on. Drawing on the works of the early pragmatists such as John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, and particularly C.S. Peirce, Meaning and Modernity is an ambitious attempt to reconstruct concepts from philosophical pragmatism for contemporary social theory. Through a vigorous and illuminating dialogue with other perspectives in the social sciences, (Rochberg-) Halton reveals the value of the pragmatic attitude as a mode of thought, one which speaks to the contemporary hunger for significance in a world where rationalized technique has all too often severed subject and object from their living context... Throughout the work is a sustained critique of modern culture in which (Rochberg-) Halton brings his reconstruction of the pragmatic atttude to bear on twentieth-century thought and its counterparts in the expressive arts. His engaging analysis encompasses figures as diverse as Simmel, Freud, Wittgenstein, Schoenberg, Adolph Loos, Mumford, Melville, the \"Vienna School of Fantastic Realism,\" and Doris Lessing. The author's semiotic approach to culture allows him to move freely and easily across many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, communications, art, literature, and philosophy. This is a work of rare originality and power that is sure to provoke discussion, for Rochberg-Halton creates new premises for understanding the human web of meaning. In a review published in the London Times Literary Supplement, Charles Townshend said that (Rochberg-) Halton's, \u201canswer to the dilemma of modernity is a still more striking synthesis, which he labels \u2018critical animism\u2019 (as distinct from primitive animism). Meaning and Modernity belies its conventional exterior: it is a passionate tract against the 'diabolical tyranny of the rational'...He pits his researches into the attitudes of Chicagoans to their household goods and to their city against the abstract semioticians who have emptied signs of their capacity to 'live objectively in the transactions people have with them'...Such humanism will probably strike his fellow social theorists as downright weird, but his work shows that the cracking shell of modernism will provide a rich intellectual agenda.\u201d",

As scientific research acquired prominence in the United States and Germany after the Second World War, its public meaning was shaped by geopolitics and fears about nuclear weapons and the uncontrollable nature of technological development. A detailed exploration of the development of Arendt\u2019s thought in this context has not been undertaken before. This essay refines our understanding of Arendt\u2019s relationship with familiar interlocutors such as Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger, and challenges readings that concentrate narrowly on her analysis of totalitarianism as a reference point for understanding her thought.",

      "abstract": "Technology enactment, an analytical framework that focuses on the processes by which new information and communication technologies come to be used by organizational actors, is distinctly institutional in orientation. An institutional perspective provides a challenge to researchers to integrate attention to structure, politics, and policy into studies of e-government. It also invites attention to the roles and relationships of formal and informal institutions. Formal institutions\u2014laws, reg- ulations, budget processes, and other governmental procedures\u2014are central to legitimation and shaping incentives for the use of ICT as an integral and inseparable set of elements in the administrative state. Informal institutions\u2014networks, norms, and trust\u2014are equally influential. Challenges in the development of e-government stem from core issues of liberty, freedom, participation, and other central elements of democracy. Structurally, however, such challenges may be viewed through an institutional lens in terms of the adequacy of formal and informal institutions to support e-government. An institutional perspective, drawing primarily from economic sociology as well as from the institutional turn in economics, provides a path to deepening studies of information and communication technologies in government in ways that can illuminate state development and capacity. In addition, this chapter describes key institutional developments in e-government during two presidential administrations in the United States as well as key developments in state and local U.S. government.",

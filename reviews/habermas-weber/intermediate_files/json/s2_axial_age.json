      "abstract": "The article examines the importance of the idea of the Axial Age (800\u2013200 bc) and the rise of the great world religions and philosophies that have influenced world history. The origins of the idea can be traced back to Max Weber\u2019s sociology of world religions and to his disciple Karl Jaspers, who promoted the idea as a critical response to the racial ideas of Nazi Germany. In contemporary approaches, the theme of the Axial Age has been embraced in sociology by Robert Bellah and Hans Joas who emphasise the Axial idea of transcendence. A major problem with the debate is that two world religions\u2014Christianity and Islam\u2014came after the formative axial period. This problem was especially acute in Hegel\u2019s philosophy of history. The modernity and global influence of Islam have been recognised by Ernest Gellner and Marshall G. S. Hodgson.",

Jaspers\u2019 \u00abaxial age\u00bb conception of world\u2019s history was founded more than 50 years ago. It has had a significant impact on the perception of both historical and philosophical processes. This theory of common grounds among the main three ancient civilizations (Greek, Chinese, and Indian) gave and additional push to study more about the genesis of philosophical reflection, since the questions what the reason were to choose certain cultural constants and why the first philosophers used them as the basic ones to create the new system of thinking are still the matter of a great discussion among researchers. This article is devoted to that part of K. Jaspers\u2019 \u00abThe Meaning and Purpose of History\u00bb, which is devoted to the foundations of Chinese civilization. This paper is in many ways a clarification of his position on the genesis of Chinese philosophy and gives a bit more details to his theses.",

      "abstract": "Max Weber\u2019s studies of the religions of China, India, and ancient Palestine and of the \u201cProtestant ethic\u201d were oriented toward illuminating their \u201ceconomic ethics\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the ways, in other words, in which their doctrines did or did not conduce to birthing \u201cmodern rational capitalism,\u201d as Weber identified the new economic order. Defining the explanandum in these terms was testimony to Weber\u2019s preoccupation with questions raised about the modern world by Karl Marx; it is not too much to say that most of Weber\u2019s scholarly efforts were in some sense a response to Marx\u2019s historical materialism. But recent economic history has cast considerable doubt on the persuasiveness of Weber\u2019s arguments about the importance of Protestantism in facilitating Western dominance of the world. Yet Weber\u2019s preoccupation with \u201ceconomic ethics\u201d and their consequences\u00a0--\u00a0understandable given his intellectual situation\u00a0--\u00a0may have distracted us from a more solid, more defensible core of his writings on religion. Against this background, we may need to re-think fundamentally our \u201creception\u201d of Weber\u2019s oeuvre, de-emphasizing his analysis of the causes of the rise of capitalism and focusing instead on the tools with which he has supplied us for the purpose of social analysis generally. Here the debate on the Axial Age helps clarify Weber\u2019s understanding of social analysis as against that of his heirs who defend the Axial Age thesis, which posits a kind of uniformity in the responses of several of the cultures of the ancient world to comparable problems of human development. In contrast, Weber was more inclined to stress the differences between these religious traditions and the consequences of those differences for social and economic order in the places where they took hold.",

This hypothesis has long functioned as a paradigm within the humanities and social sciences. However, due to the apparent \u201cresurgence\u201d of publicly influential religion throughout the world in recent years, scholars have recognized that a \u201cstraightforward narrative of progress from the religious to the secular\u201d is no longer viable. I describe the current state of narrative perplexity regarding the changing place of religion in the modern world as the \u201cpost-secular problematic.\u201d The aim of this article is to examine the contours of one specific post-secular narrative of religious change\u2014the one that has crystallized around the concept of the axial age\u2014and consider how it can be used to reconceptualize the public role of religion in the modern world.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of the paper is to analyze the context and the implications of K. Jaspers' concept of the Axial Age as the formative period of metaphysics and monotheism and to assess the capability of this concept to justify the universalism of modernity. It is emphasized that the concept of the Axial Age was intended initially not only for the historical research, but also for the philosophical reconstruction of the world history. Hence, the consideration is focused on the changes in the structure of thinking that attended the formation of the new social fabric after the Axial Age and resulted in the emergence of metaphysics and monotheism. It is observed that just those changes could render possible prototyping the universalism that, however, became required and was actualized only in modernity. The structural similarity between metaphysics and monotheism as the universal patterns of unity is studied in connection with the analysis of the transition from the social frameworks that were based on immediate contacts to the mediated societal relationships. It is pointed out that the hierarchical structure of both metaphysics and monotheism as opposed to the disorderly aggregations of the fuzzy images which are reputedly inherent in the so-called primitive mentality depends on the notion of binary oppositions. Therefore, the critique of the concept of hierarchy in the history of philosophy fair enough took the shape of the yearning for the overcoming of metaphysics and thus the concept of binary oppositions. In this connection, it is noticed that the renunciation of binarism would make the concept of the Axial Age optional. It causes the difficulties of distinguishing between the peculiar logic of postmodernity that seeks to blur every identity and the thinking that was formerly ascribed only to the societies which preceded the Axial Age. Thereby, the prototype of universalism that goes back to the Axial Age is brought into question.",

The special focus is laid on the post-war situation in Western Europe which was one of the main factors of the formation of the aforementioned conceptions and ideas. The disaster which was brought by uncontrolled nationalism in Germany forced Jaspers to rethink the crisis of humanism after World War II. Using a comparative method Jaspers seeks a unity of human spirit and with this gesture his thinking appears to be a desire to have a foundation for the common being of contemporary society. Jaspers\u2019 interpretation of paradigmatic individuals stimulated future research on comparative civilizational philosophies.",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "Private sector organizations work to make a profit, so their main goals should keep their organizational performance high. However, the main motivation of public organizations is efficiency, not productivity. Therefore, public organizations have displayed an image that is far from efficiency for a long time and organizational performance has not received enough attention. With the neo-liberal policies under the influence of public administration, public organizations adopted private sector principles and tried to increase their organizational performance. The study was prepared with reference to Max Weber's \u201crationalization theory\u201d and Habermas' \u201ccommunicative action theory\u201d with the assumption that the factors underlying the success of all organizations are based on rational actions and communication action phenomena. In this context, within the scope of the inquiry, the effect of communicative rational action on organizational performance and the moderating role of the sector (Private or public sector) in the relationship between communicative rational action and organizational performance were examined. For this aim, data were collected from 391 managers residing in the provinces of \u0130zmir, Manisa and, U\u015fak who are working in the private and public sectors. We used SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 24 statistics programs were used within the context of this study. Explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis, correlation, hierarchical regression and simple slope analysis are used to verify the hypotheses of the study. The findings indicate that rationality, value rational action, practical rational action, rational communication and firm family (stakeholders) have a positive effect on organizational performance, and the sector has a moderating role in the relations between value rational action-organizational performance, Firm Family (stakeholders)-organizational performance and rational communication-organizational performance. In this sense, while the positive relationship between value rational action-organizational performance and firm family(stakeholders)-organizational performance is stronger in the private sector, the positive relationship between rational communication-organizational performance is stronger in the public sector.",

      "abstract": "This study refers to how the Pela concept within the Maluku. This study relates to how the Pela concept within the Maluku community has a broad influence on the rationalization of the life-world. Modernity, liberalism, and the currents of globalization that fuel technical progress can jeopardize the rationalization of our life-world, which is essential for the integrity and solidarity of society, but neglect of technological progress should not be a proposition. Therefore, researchers, with the help of the dialectic of Habermas and Hardiman\u2019s thoughts with their post-secular thoughts, found a motive to examine how Indonesian multiculturalism has the potential to rationalize the development of society. Using the perspective of Jurgen Habermas and Hardiman based on post-secular theory, the purpose of this study helped researchers study the forms of deliberation from the Pela system. Qualitative research is the research method used. The critical paradigm is the chosen solution. This study combines Pela concepts associated with Habermas and Hardiman\u2019s post-secular thinking and uses Habermas\u2019 critical hermeneutic theory. The results of this study show the decision-making process. In this context, the researchers found the Pela concept as the initial capital of the Maluku people to support technical progress without neglecting the roots of solidarity. This research can be a reference for further researchers in sociology, ethnology, and even human resource management.",

The sample group consisted of senior administrators of 87 firms acting in Turkey\u2019s different Organized Industrial Zones or Free Zones. Data were analyzed by the SPSS 21 and AMOS 22 programs. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were applied to the obtained data. In order to test item discrimination, total item correlations were calculated and items under the value of 0.40 were removed from the scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 21 articles and five factors. The correlation coefficient of the 21-article scale with a similar scale is 0.979 (p < 0.001). The Cronbach\u2019s alpha value is 0.945 and the test\u2013retest correlation parameter is r = 0.793 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, it was determined by confirmatory factor analysis that the Communicative Rational Action Scale has a good cohesion criterion, and it is a valid and reliable assessment instrument.",

      "abstract": "The paper shows the philosophical content of Max Weber\u2019s contribution to a theory of modernity. Weber adopts the deepest questions of the classical philosophical tradition, adding important dimensions and differentiations to them. The specific nature of modern subjectivity is the achievement of a cultural becoming, and it is far more complex than all contemporary interpretations that consider the modern era to be at its end. \u2014 (I) Firstly, we will interpret the well-known (and influential) text The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus, 1904/05), with a special focus on its philosophical-theoretical thoughtelements. That which Weber refers to here philosophically as the \u201cSpirit\u201d of a way of life and of its social forms encompasses the whole of a cultural transformation: a fundamental change in the concept of action, in the conception of the acting subject, in the horizon of the space of action (\u201cworld\u201d), and in the understanding of sociality. In this new structure of individuality, subjectivity is connected with \u201cobjectiveness\u201d [Sachlichkeit], of all things. Notwithstanding, the essence of all of these fundamental changes cannot be characterized solely through (modern) rationality and rationalization, but is fixed on people equipped with a specific habitual ethos. \u2014 (II) In the second part, we aim to develop Weber\u2019s idea further on a general level, from the point of view of present-day debates on subjectivity. To this end, we will discern four systematically decisive issues: (1) One component of modern subjectivity is the \u201cinner\u201d social relatedness; there is always an internal forum where the affiliation to a \u201cwe\u201d is confirmed and acknowledged (or rejected). (2) Weber saw the significance of the psychologization of the self (and of others) \u2014 of the different cultural images, concepts and explanations of subjectivity. (3) From this perspective, subjectivity (both in thought and in practice) is essentially the history of its interpretations \u2014 a process of many legacies and their transformation. (4) Existing social forms are above all sedimented \u201cSpirit\u201d, in connection with impositions of participation and conformity (and of \u201cformation\u201d [Bildung]); the established social reality itself generates specific cultural profiles of subjectivity.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the intellectual legacy of the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory, focusing on its origins, transformations, and intergenerational dialogues. The School's primary objective is to philosophically analyze and critique the social pathologies and contradictions engendered by modern capitalist societies. Influenced by philosophers like Kant, Hegel, and Marx, as well as psychoanalysis and Weberian rationalization debates, the School addressed historical context, capitalism's cultural forms, and new types of social subjectivity. The article traces the evolution from the first generation's critique of modernity and domination (Horkheimer, Adorno), through the innovations of the second generation with Habermas's theory of communicative action, to the contributions of the third generation, particularly Axel Honneth's theory of recognition. It highlights Honneth's effort to center the struggle for recognition within Critical Theory\u2014addressing the perceived shortcomings of previous generations (especially the pessimism of the first generation and the moral experiences overlooked by Habermas's theory)\u2014and provide a new normative foundation. The theory of recognition reveals the moral dimensions underlying social conflicts and emancipatory struggles, emphasizing the importance of intersubjective relations.",

      "abstract": "Seidenberg\u2019s (1950, 1961) writings parallel Max Weber\u2019s rationalization theory, asserting that the distinguishing characteristic of modernity is the increasing dominance of rational organization over social action. However, like Jacques Ellul (1964), Seidenberg extrapolates the rationalization process into the future, warning that it is advancing at an everquickening pace and poses an significant threat to what it means to be human. Rational social organizations are processes of consciously contrived and defined relationships calculated for the effective and efficient achievement of goals. Seidenberg traces the deepening reach of rational organization throughout history. He argues that social evolution is fashioning a system driven by social intelligence and bolstered by technological and scientific developments across various domains such as energy, organization, communications, data collection, propaganda, and education. Technological innovations, including computers, the internet, and social media, have disrupted political economies, the environment, and cultural norms of modern societies, while simultaneously expanding organizational tools of coordination and manipulation. Seidenberg emphasizes the inherent need for further organization in response to these disruptions. As social organizations expand their functions and effectiveness, individuals are progressively integrated into organizational hierarchies as producers and consumers, becoming easily manipulatable subjects for maximum efficiency and predictability. This expansion comes at the cost of weakening family and community bonds and limiting individual freedom. Seidenberg explores this evolutionary adaptation from prehistoric times to the mid-twentieth century, then goes beyond the projections of Weber and Ellul by envisioning the adaptation\u2019s immediate and distant futures more effectively than either sociologist. His work contributes to understanding the complex interplay between rational organization, social evolution, and the challenges it poses to human identity and social cohesion. By contextualizing historical trends and forecasting future implications, Seidenberg\u2019s work invites critical reflection on the potential consequences of the ongoing rationalization process.",

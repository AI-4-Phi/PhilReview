      "abstract": "This article seeks, through concepts and standards, and using ongoing research, to investigate the principle of segregation of functions and its application in the control of public expenditure from the perspective of Weber's ideal type and Habermas' theory of communicative action. . Through documentary and bibliographical research, it was possible to partially conclude that civil servants, teams or sectors should not perform functions in different phases of public expenditure, including and especially in phases that involve judgment and inspection; the principle of segregation of functions is also based on Weber's bureaucratic ideal type, in the sense that the specialization and expertise of the civil servant tends to increase the degree of precision and excellence of the activities carried out by him; This principle also finds support in Habermas' theory of communicative action.",

This paper uses narrative literature review to recognize Max Weber's Social Action Theory. It is found that Weber's social action theory originated from the formation of a cultural tradition of thought by his father and mother as well as the formal formation of his learning process and was certainly influenced by the German historian, philosopher, economist and political theorist Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) as well as influenced by Nietzsche (1844-1900). It is found that social action always has motives (Intention) and meaning (Meaning) directed to others and to oneself. Transformational social action can be rational which he calls instrumental rationality and value rationality. As well as being Non-Rational. He called it Affection-oriented social action and Traditional Orientation.",

Therefore, the harmonious issue of supervisor-postgraduate relationship becomes an academic hot-spot.

In view of this, this paper draws on the core connotation of Habermas' theory of interactional behaviour to analyse the real dilemma of the current mentoring relationship, and to reconstruct the new era of graduate student mentoring relationship of mutual respect, understanding, equality, and harmonious coexistence in terms of four dimensions: interactional rationality, language, life world, and intersubjectivity.",

      "abstract": "More than forty years ago, J. Habermas published his two-volume Theory of Communicative Action in German, encapsulating over twenty years of reflection and research. The core concept of his intellectual pursuits was that the indestructible element of semantic rationality is rooted in the social form of communicative action, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive social theory, safeguarded through modern philosophy of language and science. In this book, as in his other works, J. Habermas intertwines an in-depth examination of theoretical traditions with his systematic argumentation, encompassing a wide range of scientific approaches. Reinterpreted theories from G. Mead, M. Weber, E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, and various versions of Marxism provided a system of conceptual coordinates within which J. Habermas recognized new ideas in social theory and tested those using factual arguments. After the book\u2019s publication, it garnered significant attention from the scientific community, which was remarkable considering the challenges it posed to readers. The initial published responses reflected its thematic complexity and ideological richness; the most common criticism, often expressed with the irony of a \u201chopelessly idealistic enterprise\u201d, was later refuted after deeper discussions. This criticism has persisted and is now supplemented with new arguments, which are countered by other counterarguments. Theory of Communicative Action has been translated into English, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has become the focal point of international discussions about social science theory. Few authors possess the argumentative skill, intellectual history knowledge, thematic breadth, and desire to diagnose the modern world required to address a variety of areas and answer pertinent questions. Those who do not participate in today\u2019s debates or have nothing to say about this influential social theorist effectively exclude themselves from being considered serious connoisseurs. The Russian edition of J. Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, translated by A. K. Sudakov and published by \u201cVes mir\u201d in 2022, was highly anticipated. However, disappointment soon followed when readers discovered the released version. Although the book\u2019s table of contents appears to align with the English translation by T. McCarthy (praised by both the global sociological community and J. Habermas himself), a closer examination of the Russian text reveals that it primarily consists of \u201csimulacra\u201d (semblances) of the original translation. According to J. Baudrillard\u2019s precise definition of \u201csimulacrum,\u201d this means it is merely an \u201cimitation of the non-existent\u201d and gives the impression of something that isn\u2019t truly there. The primary issue is that translator A. K. Sudakov disrupted the key semantic context by replacing the fundamental term \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (\u201chandeln,\u201d or \u201caction\u201d in the English translation) with the unrelated term \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u201ct\u00e4tigkeiten,\u201d \u201cactivity\u201d). From a modern sociological theory perspective, using the term \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (communicative activity) instead of \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (communicative action) is a significant violation of the logical progression and development of initial premises. Habermas formulated his concept of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d based on T. Parsons\u2019 approach to defining \u201caction\u201d as a singular social act, while the category of \u201cactivity\u201d is rooted in an extremely broad definition of \u201chuman activity\u201d. This article examines numerous glaring errors and distortions in the translations that not only affect the semantic structures of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d but also the entirety of modern sociology. As a result, the review is titled \u201cSimulacra of Translation\u201d to highlight these issues through various examples of factual \u201creinterpretations\u201d of the book\u2019s key meanings and concepts.",

However, not all case conferences have proven to be effective. The Norwegian Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for the Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (TIME) is an effective multicomponent model based on case conferences that informs approaches to behavioural and psychological symptoms in residents with dementia in nursing homes. Our aim was to explore how TIME case conferences structured based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) contributed to person-centred actions and how the specific inductive structure of the TIME may have contributed to the effectiveness of the model. We used video observation of six case conferences and analysed these videos by performing a thematic cross-case analysis of the transcripts from the videos and by iteratively watching the videos. According to Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action, we emphasized the case conference content, i.e., what was talked about in the case conferences, and the display of communication between the participants in the case conferences. Our findings showed that the theoretical principles behind the TIME, including both person-centred care and the inductive structure of CBT, reflected many aspects of Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative actions. In particular, the TIME case conferences emphasized the lifeworld perspective for both residents and staff and contributed to what Habermas labelled communicative rationality as a means to develop shared understanding among staff and create person-centred action. One causal assumption of how and why the TIME case conferences contributed to the effectiveness of the TIME in reducing BPSD in nursing homes is that the specific inductive structure of the case conferences with the column technique based on the ABC method together with PCC, emphasized the importance of the lifeworld for both the resident and the staff. Even though case conferences have been highlighted as useful, it is not indifferent how these case conferences are structured and conducted. The trial TIME was registered January 6, 2016, with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02655003).",

The guiding question of the essay is: does the transition proposed by Habermas from other rationality types to the communicative concern an interparadigmatic theory or a paradigmatic leap? Methodologically, we adopted the conception of an essay according to which authors and readers need to recognize that reality can be understood in different ways. The discussion, contextualized in public administration, allowed us to understand that considering the communicative action theory as having an interparadigmatic character does not mean it is a mere gathering of other theories because it surpasses those it dialogues with, additionally presenting a radical shift. We propose that the Communicative action theory comprises a paradigmatic leap with interparadigmatic characteristics. Finally, we present implications of this discussion for Public Administration.",

Because of its process-based and inclusive qualities, Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality is particularly apposite for the dynamic nature of digital open-source information and the heterogenous range of actors and institutions which have relevant experiences and skills to contribute to the generation of norms and determinations regarding its role before the Court. This is important, as the International Criminal Court\u2019s procedural framework is largely silent on digital material, despite the risks of such materials being misinterpreted or misused as a vehicle for disinformation. In the absence of prescriptive regulatory responses, this article argues that J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality provides a justifiable framework for the court\u2019s judicial deliberations regarding digital information. Importantly, Habermas emphasizes forming a broad epistemic community to draw specialists into the deliberative process. As the truth-seeking evidentiary function increasingly moves outside of the courtroom, Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality constitutes an inclusive approach capable of inculcating specialized knowledge into judicial deliberations. In this way, communicative rationality can provide a powerful conceptual justification for the judicial exercise of power regarding the emerging phenomenon of digital open-source information.",

It explores how these two theoretical frameworks interpret key democratic concepts such as legitimacy, participation, the public sphere, and representation. While Habermas emphasizes rational deliberation and consensus as the foundation of democratic legitimacy, Mouffe argues that conflict and dissent are essential to democratic vitality. The study, based on literature review and conceptual comparison, illustrates these perspectives through examples from social media, civil society movements, and local democracy. The analysis highlights that both approaches provide valuable insights into contemporary democratic theory. It concludes that pluralist democracies require a balanced consideration of both consensus-oriented and conflictual democratic practices to address the complexities of legitimacy and representation in today\u2019s political contexts.",

These analyses are based on social theory placing insufficient emphasis on the emancipatory potential of evidence, and the possibility of rational adjudication of truth claims. We argue sociological engagement with evidence-based policy could be transformed by being informed by the work of Habermas. Habermas\u2019 work could enable a more nuanced view of EBP in terms of whether or not this leads to rationalisation in the form of de-politicisation or marginalisation of citizens\u2019 voices. Habermas\u2019 work on knowledge-constitutive interests could inform a reconstructed view of evidence, disabused of positivist assumptions and with increased emancipatory potential. Habermas\u2019 notion of the ideal speech situation as a procedural basis for truth could function as a standard for exploring how EBP is affected by power asymmetries, as well as for adjudicating truth claims.",

Habermas\u2019 theory of communicative action, identifying three functions that communicative action can perform: to be used to convey information, to establish social relationships with others, and to express one\u2019s opinions or feelings. By analyzing the category of \u201ccommunicative rationality\u201d with religious issues in the public sphere, in relation to language, discourse ethics, it is shown that the public sphere is the environment where dialogues in all areas take place to meet the needs of citizens. (According to Habermas, Kant was the first philosophy to give to public sphere \u201cits completed theoretical structure\u201d in a text of political philosophy, entitled \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d). \nReligions may not directly influence politics, but still, have the function of directing in society. J. Habermas determines that religion cannot be restricted to the private sphere, but must actively participate in the public sphere, where interactions and dialogues take place, as a catalyst for the process of solidarity to exist, to bring a new life force to the world. It is the place for members of society to have conversations and engage with each other. \nThe theory of communication by J. Habermas is timely contemplation with a deeply humane spirit.",

      "abstract": "In the philosophical theory of communicative action, rationality refers to interpersonal communication rather than to a knowing subject. Thus, a social view of rationality is suggested. The theory differentiates between two kinds of rationality, the emancipative communicative and the strategic or instrumental reasoning. Using experimental designs in an fMRI setting, recent studies explored similar questions of reasoning in the social world and linked them with a neural network including prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Here, we employed an fMRI approach to highlight brain areas associated with strategic and communicative reasoning according to the theory of communicative action. Participants were asked to assess different social scenarios with respect to communicative or strategic rationality. We found a network of brain areas including temporal pole, precuneus, and STS more activated when participants performed communicative reasoning compared with strategic thinking and a control condition. These brain regions have been previously linked to moral sensitivity. In contrast, strategic rationality compared with communicative reasoning and control was associated with less activation in areas known to be related to moral sensitivity, emotional processing, and language control. The results suggest that strategic reasoning is associated with reduced social and emotional cognitions and may use different language related networks. Thus, the results demonstrate experimental support for the assumptions of the theory of communicative action.",

Ironically, conservative and radical Islamic models have dominated the digital space. Therefore, in response to this phenomenon, this research examines how the mainstreaming strategy of religious moderation is carried out by moderate groups, specifically a non-affiliated Islamic portal called Islami.co, with the tagline \u201cEnlightening and Friendly Islamic Media.\u201d This research also analyzed articles, concepts, and perspectives to determine whether they are in the moderate category using the J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 theory of communicative rationality. Furthermore, the essays in the islami.co were analyzed according to three kinds of validity claims, namely truth, accuracy, and honesty. This study concluded that mainstreaming religious moderation through this islami.co\u2019s media significantly impacts the community as a filter from news content or thoughts that do not reflect the Islamic value of mercy to all mankind. Islami.co\u2019s writers continuously endeavor to test conservative-radical Islamic narratives that develop in a society with logical (aqli) and religious (naqli) arguments presented with brief and uncomplicated explanations. The strategy of popular Islamic portals such as islami.co is quite acceptable to middle-class Muslims, as often preached by the fundamentalist groups. Therefore, it is very appropriate to direct islami.co\u2019s target audience to readers from the general public.

Habermas put forward a theory of communicative action that emphasizes rationality and intersubjective agreement. Meanwhile, Al-Farabi highlighted the importance of virtue and collective purpose in creating an ideal society, and Confucius emphasized the principles of harmony, hierarchical relationships, and the values of politeness. Through qualitative analysis with a literature study approach, this study finds similarities between the three thoughts, namely the importance of a dialogue based on morality that integrates rationality, virtue, and harmony. The proposed model of intercultural communication consists of five main pillars: equality in dialogue, respect for diversity, the search for common truth, the application of virtue, and the achievement of collective harmony. This model is particularly relevant in facing the increasingly urgent challenges of globalization for ethical and inclusive intercultural interactions. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Agile methodologies have transformed organizational management by prioritizing team autonomy and iterative learning cycles. However, these approaches often lack structured mechanisms for knowledge retention and interoperability, leading to fragmented decision-making, information silos, and strategic misalignment. This study proposes an alternative approach to knowledge management in Agile environments by integrating Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi\u2019s theory of knowledge creation\u2014 specifically the concept of Ba, a shared space where knowledge is created and validated\u2014with J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, which emphasizes deliberation as the foundation for trust and legitimacy in organizational decision-making. To operationalize this integration, we propose the Deliberative Permeability Metric (DPM), a diagnostic tool that evaluates knowledge flow and the deliberative foundation of organizational decisions, and the Communicative Rationality Cycle (CRC), a structured feedback model that extends the DPM, ensuring long-term adaptability and data governance. This model was applied at Livelo, a Brazilian loyalty program company, demonstrating that structured deliberation improves operational efficiency and reduces knowledge fragmentation. The findings indicate that institutionalizing deliberative processes strengthens knowledge interoperability, fostering a more resilient and adaptive approach to data governance in complex organizations.",

This article aims to explore the contribution of the philosophy of educational psychology through Habermas' critical approach in forming a more democratic and emancipatory educational paradigm. The research was conducted using the Systematic Literature Review method of Habermas' works and literature on educational philosophy, educational psychology, and national education policy. The focus of the study is directed at the ontological, epistemological, and axiological dimensions of education, as well as the application of communicative action theory in the learning environment. The results of the study show that Habermas' approach, which emphasizes dialogue, communicative rationality, and emancipation, is relevant in dismantling oppressive power structures in education. The application of this theory is able to create an inclusive and equal educational public space, and encourage active participation of students. This concept is in line with the current direction of Indonesian education, such as Merdeka Belajar, and can strengthen character education and social awareness. In conclusion, the integration of Habermas' critical approach in Indonesian education provides a conceptual and practical foundation for the transformation of the education system towards a humanistic and reflective democratic society.",

It addresses the epistemological and hermeneutic challenges posed by the reinterpretation of religious traditions in contemporary societies, where secular and pluralistic values often clash with inherited religious meanings. On the basis of Habermas's communicative action theory and his engagement with modern hermeneutics, this study examines how rational discourse can foster mutual understanding and uncover the deeper layers of meaning embedded in religious language. Particular attention is given to the distinction between discursive and nondiscursive validity claims, the role of language in shaping public reasoning, and the potential of interpretation as a means of cultural integration and ethical reflection. By connecting Habermas's ideas with broader hermeneutic traditions and thinkers such as Mohammed Arkoun and Paul Ric\u0153ur, the paper highlights the critical function of interpretation in negotiating the boundaries between faith and reason, tradition and modernity. Ultimately, the study affirms that the rational reinterpretation of religious texts is essential to fostering inclusive dialogue and sustaining democratic coexistence in pluralistic societies.",

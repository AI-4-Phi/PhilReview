In addition to clarifying the normative foundations of critical social inquiry, this sets the stage for a systematic appropriation of Weber's theory of rationalization and its Marxist reception by Lukacs, Horkheimer and Adorno."

        "The importance of Edmund Husserl's concept of the lifeworld, especially as it appears in The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, is widely acknowledged. Yet there is also wide agreement among Husserl scholars that his treatment of the lifeworld is marred by deep faults.",
        "When you find and tap these faults Husserl's presentation of the lifeworld falls to pieces, thereby revealing distinct, incommensurable concepts. The main thrust of my dissertation is to challenge this commonly held opinion. Limiting my analysis to the Crisis alone, I argue that Husserl's treatment of the lifeworld is consistent and coherent.",
        "In order to make this argument, as well as to understand it, it is imperative that one pay special attention to the contexts in which Husserl discusses the theme of the lifeworld. The failure to do this accounts for much of the confusion about the lifeworld found in the secondary literature.",

The lifeworld is a transcendental phenomenon, i.e., the system of object-poles of intentionality, which itself is nothing other than transcendental subjectivity."

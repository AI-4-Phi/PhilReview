      "abstract": "ABSTRACT William Outhwaite is well-known as an early proponent of critical realism and for his work on European politics, critical theory and on J\u00fcrgen Habermas. In this wide-ranging interview, he discusses his life and career, including how he came to write on subjects that intersected with and developed themes Roy Bhaskar was also working on at the time. This work resulted in three early books, Understanding Social Life, Concept Formation in Social Science and New Philosophies of Social Science, the last of which makes the case for the incorporation of critical theory and hermeneutics into critical realism. He goes on to discuss various issues, including, briefly, his involvement in an early discussion group with Bhaskar, his participation in the Realism and the Human Sciences conferences and how he and Margaret Archer came to edit Andrew Collier\u2019s Festschrift.",

In this paper, we develop empowerment theory with a critical realism (CR) lens. Through the example of a study of empowerment, we examine how can it be used as a guiding paradigm for research in community psychology (CP). We sought to increase theoretical rigor by using a CR approach to interdisciplinarity. We put empowerment into conversation with Social Reproduction Theory and Black, Indigenous, People of Color feminisms, because both represent situated knowledge that address experiences with oppression and focus on dismantling systems of oppression. We illustrate how a CR approach shaped our understanding of empowerment, and in turn, provided an analysis that was (a) more nuanced and actionable, (b) more aligned with CP values and definitions of social justice, and (c) more likely to contribute to the field by developing an intersectional anticapitalist and feminist intervention into empowerment literature. This paper highlights how, aligned with an interdisciplinary CR approach, we questioned assumptions about empowerment theory, which influenced our empirical work so that we could provide a more focused critique of unjust social arrangements, and with it, the possibility to act upon those arrangements.",

By starting from a theory of action approach focusing on the process of inquiring and understanding intentional action, Haber-mas developed a hermeneutical re\u00dfection approach emphasizing the importance of communicative experience between the researcher and the subject examined. This approach has emancipatory power because it encourages researchers to thoroughly identify the ideological elements of social reality researched. Apart from all the advantages of Habermas\u2019 methodological thought, his thinking should be evaluated critically because there are problematic aspects when viewed through the lens of ontology, methodology/method, and axiology.",

Supported by abductive reasoning, this approach enables the progressive construction of knowledge through continuous interaction between theory and empirical observation. Methodologically, the use of a mixed-methods approach\u2014combining qualitative and quantitative tools\u2014promotes a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under study. Altogether, this framework provides a coherent basis for examining supply chain resilience in a manner that is both rigorous and context-sensitive.\nKeywords: Supply chain resilience, critical realism, abductive reasoning, mixed methods.\n\u00a0\nReceived Date:\u00a0November 05, 2024\nAccepted Date:\u00a0November 26, 2024\nPublished Date:\u00a0December 01, 2024\nAvailable Online at\u00a0https://www.ijsrisjournal.com/index.php/ojsfiles/article/view/484",

However, its transformative potential remains limited when structural root causes of vulnerability are insufficiently addressed. This article argues\u2014via the methodology of problematization\u2014that aligning CBA with the broader agenda of social-ecological transformation requires a stronger philosophical foundation. We propose critical realism as a suitable philosophy of science to translate CBA\u2019s emancipatory ambitions into a robust analytical and methodological practice. Critical realism is a practically oriented philosophy facilitating causal analyses coherent with its realist ontology and relativistic epistemology. It illuminates the interplay between agency and structure, enhancing CBA to confront power imbalances and systemic injustices while supporting local agency. By conjoining insights from political ecology and political economy, we show how critical realism offers analytical coherence, methodological robustness, and normative orientation for transformative adaptation practice. We delineate nine key synergies between critical realism and CBA that together provide the conceptual scaffolding for a politically powerful, reflexive, and justice-oriented adaptation science. In doing so, the paper contributes to rethinking CBA as not merely a localized coping mechanism but as part of a structural response to the social-ecological crisis.",

This article contributes to an emerging discussion about how CR can be applied, drawing on an example of a qualitative study that has sought to understand and explain the causes of unmet need amongst a group of rural labourers in Tunisia . Using this study as an illustration, I show how techniques from grounded theory methodology can be usefully harnessed in the data collection, coding and analysis stages of a research project that adopts a CR philosophical and methodological framework. I illustrate how an \u2018abductive\u2019 variant of grounded theory allowed drawing on pre-existing theoretical knowledge throughout the research stages; whilst open and axial coding techniques could be harnessed for identifying and postulating CR causal mechanisms. This article should be of interest to students and researchers involved with grounded theory and applied critical realism.",

Most of these applications are based on the early rendition of the philosophy, with little attention given to Bhaskar\u2019s later, more mature, development of dialectical critical realism. This article addresses this gap, describing how dialectic critical realism builds on the early iteration of the philosophy to account for emancipatory change in the social world. The contribution of dialectical critical realism to anti-oppressive social work is then considered through the articulation of six, interlinked steps of transformative change. Finally, the preceding meta-theoretical steps are applied to a fictitious case example involving a young person leaving care. The aim here is to show how the steps can be integrated within social work practice to stimulate positive change, human emancipation and well-being.",

      "abstract": "There is a widespread concern that some aspects of digital media use may be detrimental to mental health. Digital media such as social media, video games, and artificial intelligence profoundly influence the daily lives of young people through practices embedded in global and particular digital cultures. Because digital technologies and their uptake are actively evolving in ways that cannot be fully anticipated, research must \"take the long view\" to develop robust theories that stand the test of time. The philosophical approach of critical realism, developed by Roy Bhaskar and others in the 1970s-1990s, provides helpful parameters for studying complex phenomena such as the relationship between digital cultures and mental health. Critical realism sees science as a social process that aims to uncover the generative structures of reality, with the understanding that causal mechanisms exist at multiple levels of inquiry, from the material to the social. Drawing from the work of Bhaskar and other critical realists, this article outlines three methodological guiding principles for the study of digital culture and mental health: (1) focusing on the causal effects of digital media, located in individual practices, technologies, sociocultural structures, or elsewhere; (2) combining methods (qualitative and quantitative) and disciplines; and (3) actively engaging with the social dimension of research. Research on digital media and mental health has the capacity to illuminate causal mechanisms and their possibilities for human emancipation, even when these mechanisms are not fully actualized or directly observed.",

      "abstract": "Bhaskar [1] proposed and argued for critical realism in natural sciences. Other authors have extended Bhaskar\u2019s [1] arguments to include the social sciences [2], and to attempt to translate his philosophical position into useful research methodologies that can compete with positivist, constructivist, and pragmatic research paradigms [3]. Critical realism describes both intransitive and transitive components of human knowledge. It proposes underlying structures and mechanisms in the Real Domain that exist independently of human observers and possess the potential to govern events occurring in the Actual Domain [1]. Events that can be experienced and investigated as phenomena by human observers form a subset that occupies the Empirical Domain where researchers normally operate [1]. For critical realists, this positivist stance is balanced by the constructivist element to knowledge. As research is also a social activity, it results in knowledge regarding external structures and mechanisms that is also undeniably socially constructed [1] [2]. Critical realism [1] [2] claims to provide a philosophical and research paradigm solution to conflicts in ontology, epistemology, and axiology when conducting mixed methods studies [3]. Further, some researchers have advocated adopting a critical realism approach for synthesising the contributions of quantitative and qualitative data collected in such investigations, even in hindsight [4]. This paper considers the adoption of a critical realism approach late in a research project. A mini thesis drew together nine research articles in the field of teacher training and education that were published in peer reviewed journals between 2013 and 2019. These formed part of a PhD by published works submission [5]. The application of a critical realism approach as a triangulation of mixed methods data and findings using stages described by Bygstad and Munkvold [6] was found to be useful in formulating a concluding model for a complex project. However, a major criticism of the approach is also considered: that the same conclusions would have been reached following other research paradigm methodologies.",

      "abstract": "\n The naturalism/anti-naturalism problematic has remained a stubbornly persistent feature of Euro-American debates about the nature and range of (social) science. Politics and International Relations (PIR) research has not been immune to the resulting \u201cparadigm wars\u201d\u2014in fact, the problematic has been central to the question of methodology in these fields. As a result of this, and as a result of the bifurcating logic that inheres in the problematic as it is most commonly conceived, claims about (global) politics have, at best, varied, and, at worst, been wildly contradictory. This has not, of course, stopped naturalists and anti-naturalists from claiming the epistemic authority (and associated perks/privileges) that each believes they are due, and the ensuing war of position has proven to be so intractable that it has inspired in some a desire for the two parties to just go their separate ways, citing irreconcilable differences. It is worth asking, therefore, whether it is time to officially \u201cuntie the knot,\u201d reach some mutually acceptable intellectual/institutional settlement, and resign ourselves to a solitary existence? Some PIR research seems to suggest that this is becoming the preferred outcome. Contrary to such assessments, this article argues that the critical naturalist position which critical realist philosophy develops/defends provides a promising alternative to the \u201ceither/or\u201d logic that characterizes much of the existing debate. Indeed, it claims that this critical naturalism provides an answer to the question of methodology that is more inclusive/encompassing (\u201cneither/both/and\u201d rather than \u201ceither/or\u201d) and scientifically plausible than the two positions that are typically held\u2014incorrectly\u2014to exhaust our options within the problematic.\n La problem\u00e1tica del naturalismo/antinaturalismo sigui\u00f3 siendo un rasgo obstinadamente persistente de los debates euroamericanos sobre la naturaleza y el alcance de la ciencia (social). La investigaci\u00f3n en Pol\u00edtica y Relaciones Internacionales (Politics and International Relations, PIR) no ha sido inmune a las subsiguientes \u00abguerras de paradigmas\u00bb; de hecho, la problem\u00e1tica ha sido el foco de la cuesti\u00f3n de la metodolog\u00eda en estos campos. Como resultado de esto y de la l\u00f3gica dividida que hereda la problem\u00e1tica tal como se concibe m\u00e1s com\u00fanmente, las reclamaciones sobre la pol\u00edtica (global) han sido, en el mejor de los casos, variadas y, en el peor, salvajemente contradictorias. Sin dudas, esto no ha impedido que los naturalistas y antinaturalistas reclamen la autoridad epist\u00e9mica (y las ventajas y los privilegios relacionados) que cada uno cree que les corresponde, y la guerra posterior de posturas ha demostrado ser tan intratable que ha inspirado en algunos el deseo de que las dos partes tomen caminos separados al mencionar diferencias irreconciliables. Por lo tanto, \u00bfvale la pena preguntarse si es hora de \u00abdesatar el nudo\u00bb de manera formal, llegar a alg\u00fan acuerdo intelectual o institucional mutuamente aceptable y resignarnos a una existencia solitaria? Algunas investigaciones en PIR parecen sugerir que esto se est\u00e1 convirtiendo en el resultado preferido. Contrario a dichas valoraciones, este art\u00edculo sostiene que la postura naturalista cr\u00edtica que desarrolla o defiende la filosof\u00eda realista cr\u00edtica brinda una alternativa prometedora a la l\u00f3gica del \u00abuno/el otro\u00bb que caracteriza gran parte del debate existente. De hecho, afirma que este naturalismo cr\u00edtico proporciona una respuesta a la cuesti\u00f3n de la metodolog\u00eda que es m\u00e1s inclusiva o integral (\u00abninguno/ambos/y\u00bb en lugar de \u00abuno/el otro\u00bb) y cient\u00edficamente viable que las dos posturas que se suelen mantener de manera incorrecta para agotar nuestras opciones dentro de la problem\u00e1tica.\n La probl\u00e9matique Naturalisme/anti-naturalisme est rest\u00e9e une caract\u00e9ristique obstin\u00e9ment persistante des d\u00e9bats euro-am\u00e9ricains sur la nature et le champ des sciences (sociales). Les recherches en politique et en relations internationales n'ont pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 aux \u00ab\u00a0conflits de paradigme\u00a0\u00bb qui en r\u00e9sultent\u00a0; en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, cette probl\u00e9matique est demeur\u00e9e centrale \u00e0 la question de m\u00e9thodologie dans ces domaines. De ce fait, et du fait de la bifurcation de la logique inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la probl\u00e9matique telle qu'elle est le plus commun\u00e9ment pens\u00e9e, les d\u00e9clarations concernant la politique (mondiale) dans ce domaine ont, au mieux, \u00e9t\u00e9 diverses et, au pire, tr\u00e8s contradictoires. Cela n'a bien \u00e9videmment pas emp\u00each\u00e9 les naturalistes et les anti-naturistes de revendiquer l'autorit\u00e9 \u00e9pist\u00e9mique (et les avantages/privil\u00e8ges associ\u00e9s) qui, selon eux, leur est due, et le conflit de positions qui s'en est suivi s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9 si insoluble qu'il a m\u00eame inspir\u00e9 \u00e0 certains le d\u00e9sir de tout simplement voir les deux parties suivre leurs propres chemins totalement distincts, en invoquant des diff\u00e9rences inconciliables. Il convient donc de se demander s'il est temps de \u00ab\u00a0trancher officiellement le n\u0153ud gordien\u00a0\u00bb, de parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement intellectuel/institutionnel mutuellement acceptable du conflit et de se r\u00e9signer \u00e0 une existence solitaire. Certaines recherches en politique et relations internationales semblent sugg\u00e9rer que cela deviendrait l'issue privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Contrairement \u00e0 de telles estimations, cet article soutient que la position des naturalistes critiques, qui est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e/d\u00e9fendue par la philosophie du r\u00e9alisme critique, offre une alternative prometteuse \u00e0 la logique du \u00ab\u00a0soit, soit\u00a0\u00bb qui caract\u00e9rise la plupart des d\u00e9bats actuels. En effet, il affirme que ce naturalisme critique offre une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de m\u00e9thodologie qui est plus inclusive/englobante (\u00ab\u00a0ni, ni/les deux/et\u00a0\u00bb plut\u00f4t que \u00ab\u00a0soit, soit\u00a0\u00bb) et scientifiquement plausible que les deux positions qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tenues (\u00e0 tort) pour \u00e9vacuer nos options dans cette probl\u00e9matique.",

It explores the complex issue of what might be appropriate philosophical bases for community psychology theory, research, and practice. In particular, it focuses on critical realism, a relatively new approach to the philosophy of science. In this introductory article, we start by discussing the importance of philosophy of science for community psychologists. We then situate our subject by exploring the history of paradigms in community psychology. We next offer a brief description of critical realism by describing its assumptions on ontology (nature of the world), epistemology (theory of knowledge), axiology (theory of values), and methodology (theory of action).",

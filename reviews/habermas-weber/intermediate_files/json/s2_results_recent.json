      "abstract": "In The Future of Human Nature, J\u00fcrgen Habermas raises the question of whether the embryonic genetic diagnosis and genetic modification threatens the foundations of the species ethics that underlies current understandings of morality. While morality, in the normative sense, is based on moral interactions enabling communicative action, justification, and reciprocal respect, the reification involved in the new technologies may preclude individuals to uphold a sense of the undisposability (Unverf\u00fcgbarkeit) of human life and the inviolability (Unantastbarkeit) of human beings that is necessary for their own identity as well as for reciprocal relations. Engaging with liberal bioethics and Catholic approaches to bioethics, the article clarifies how Habermas\u2019 position offers a radical critique of liberal autonomy while maintaining its postmetaphysical stance. The essay argues that Habermas\u2019 approach may guide the question of rights of future generations regarding germline gene editing. But it calls for a different turn in the conversation between philosophy and theology, namely one that emphasizes the necessary attention to rights violations and injustices as a common, postmetaphysical starting point for critical theory and critical theology alike.\u00a0In 2001, J\u00fcrgen Habermas published a short book on questions of biomedicine that took many by surprise.[1] To some of his students, the turn to a substantive position invoking the need to comment on a species ethics rather than outlining a public moral framework was seen as the departure from the \u201cpath of deontological virtue,\u201d[2] and at the same time a departure from postmetaphysical reason. Habermas\u2019 motivation to address the developments in biomedicine had certainly been sparked by the intense debate in Germany, the European Union, and internationally on human cloning, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, embryonic stem cell research, and human enhancement. He turned to a strand of critical theory that had been pushed to the background by the younger Frankfurt School in favor of cultural theory and social critique, even though it had been an important element of its initial working programs. The relationship of instrumental reason and critical theory, examined, among others, by Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse and taken up in Habermas\u2019 own Knowledge and Interest and Theory of Communicative Action became ever-more actual with the development of the life sciences, human genome analysis, and genetic engineering of human offspring. Today, some of the fictional scenarios discussed at the end of the last century as \u201cscience fiction\u201d have become reality: in 2018, the first \u201cgermline gene-edited\u201d children were born in China.[3] Furthermore, the UK\u2019s permission to create so-called \u201cthree-parent\u201d children may create a legal and political pathway to hereditary germline interventions summarized under the name of \u201cgene editing.\u201dIn this article, I want to explore Habermas\u2019 \u201csubstantial\u201d argument in the hope that (moral) philosophy and (moral) theology become allies in their struggle against an ever-more reifying lifeworld, which may create a \u201cmoral void\u201d that would, at least from today\u2019s perspective, be \u201cunbearable\u201d (73), and for upholding the conditions of human dignity, freedom, and justice. I will contextualize Habermas\u2019 concerns in the broader discourse of bioethics, because only by doing this, his concerns are rescued from some misinterpretations.[1] J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Future of Human Nature (Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2003).[2] Ibid., 125, fn. 58. 8[3] Up to the present, no scientific publication of the exact procedure exists, but it is known that the scientist, Jiankui He, circumvented the existing national regulatory framework and may have misled the prospective parents about existing alternatives and the unprecedented nature of his conduct.

      "abstract": "The rise of secularism is one of the most striking features of modernity. Following J\u00fcrgen Habermas (2008, pp. 18, 27), this has involved three characteristics: (a) dominance of a \u2018disenchanted\u2019 worldview in the public domain based on a \u2018hard\u2019 scientific naturalism; (b) restriction of organized religion to the private domain with a role that is primarily pastoral; and (c) appreciation for higher standards of living, reduction in risks to life, and increased existential security resulting from advanced technologies. This rise was not the result of a single transformation, according to Charles Taylor (2007), but a series of departures, in which earlier forms of life were destabilized to reveal new ones. Among other considerations, these departures where grounded in both sides of the modern dialectic between Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment, the former requiring the acceptance of one or another account of reason as a condition for entry into the public square, the latter allegiance to one or another view of solidarity (Berlin, 1998, pp. 243\u2013268). Understood as the awareness that power interests are inexorably embedded in the human condition, postmodernism challenged a so-called left-leaning interpretation of the Counter-Enlightenment side of this dialectic\u2014the utopian aspirations of Marxist and neo-Marxist critical social theory. In so doing, however, it dramatically increased skepticism concerning what was left of the Enlightenment side as well. This after Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel\u2019s earlier critique of Immanuel Kant\u2019s influential presupposition that the very possibility of knowledge is grounded in the rational structure of mind, independent of history, culture, language, and other characteristics of particularity (2004). Hegel situated the possibility of universal knowledge within, not logically prior to, history (Hegel, 1953). Yet, when postmodern skepticism is turned on itself, what remains is an epistemological paradox. If we are to doubt Marxist and neo-Marxist utopianism along with Kantian rationalism, each due to embedded power interests, why not also the very postmodern obsession with power itself? If all views are corrupted by power, can postmodernism be exempt? This critique of postmodernism has not left the arguments that contributed to the rise of secularism unshaken. Although in some societies religious belief and practice have markedly declined, according to Taylor, today\u2019s world is characterized by the emergence of new religious, spiritual, and antireligious options that people use to make sense of their lives and give shape to their aspirations. Habermas referred to this growing public appreciation for diversity in belief and unbelief as \u2018postsecular society.\u2019 Such a society is rife with both opportunities and dangers, for personal and collective growth, on the one hand, and religious and antireligious extremism, on the other. Following Isaiah Berlin\u2019s recognition that human experience is comprised of an infinite variety of deeply different ways to live (Berlin, 1998; pp. 191\u2013242), I have argued that a key task of pedagogy in this postsecular moment is to promote peaceful coexistence across difference by learning to define ourselves within intelligent spiritualties that eschew extremes through dialog with alternative worldviews (Alexander, 2015).",

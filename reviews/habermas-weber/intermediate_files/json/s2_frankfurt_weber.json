      "abstract": "Critical Theory from 1923 to the present day is mostly associated with the Frankfurt School and activities of the Institute for Social Research (German: Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung). Thinkers such as W. Benjamin, E. Bloch, and G. Scholem belong to the environment of the Institute. The Institute is usually associated with three generations of thinkers: the representatives of the first generation would be M. Horkheimer, T. Adorno, H. Marcuse; the representative of the second generation would be J. Habermas; the representative of the third generation would be A. Honneth. The classical premises of Critical Theory come from the works of Western Marxism \u2013 G. Luk\u00e1cs, then from the works of sociology \u2013 M. Weber, and from psychoanalysis \u2013 S. Freud. Their followers and interpreters also belong here as well as A. Schonberg\u2019s atonal music (\u201catonal dialectic\u201d) and G. Scholem\u2019s mystical and at the same time apophatic anarchism. In this book the author emphasizes apophatic cultural philosophy and criticism, which is related to T. Adorno\u2019s negative dialectic and S. \u017di\u017eek\u2019s Lacanian critique of thinking. Other thinkers, such as H. Arendt, J. Derrida, G. Agamben, J. Butler, R. Braidotti, S. Buck-Morss did not belong to the afore mentioned Institute, however, they do belong to Critical Theory. In Lithuania, Critical Theory is developed in one way or another by a whole set of philosophers: V. Rubavi\u010dius, Z. Norkus, A. \u017dukauskait\u0117, K. Kirtiklis. K. Pocius, T. Kavaliauskas and others. One of the main themes of Critical Theory is the analysis and critique of symbolical thinking and culture industries in the context of continental philosophy. [...]",

Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "The article presents a retrospective of the formation of the Frankfurt School. Such a view of the school has not yet been formed in Russian-language literature. In it (literature), as a rule, attention is focused on individual figures of the school, without representing their place in the logic of generations. In the 1950s, representatives of the first generation of the Frankfurt School (first of all, M. Horkheimer and T. Adorno) in their criticism of the fascist and totalitarian regimes built the foundation of critical theory, which they used later in the social analysis of Capitalist society. M. Horkheimer identified the key setting of the school as the emancipation of workers from the framework of the economic regime, liberation of the consciousness of the working class from the boundaries set by capitalism. In the 1970s, J. Habermas, within the framework of the theory of communicative action, continued the tradition of social criticism in two semantic directions: in the Leftist one \u2014 focusing on social injustices, and in the Kantian one \u2014 in the search for grounds for social criticism as such. Later, in the 1990s, A. Honneth focused on the so-called negative intersubjectivity, which is expressed in the struggle of social groups for recognition. In this struggle, he found a truly social dimension of life, which is built on the principles of normativity. In 2018, A. Honneth handed over the post of Director of the Institute of Social Research to S. Lessenich. Despite the fact that today it is difficult to predict what the course of S. Lessenich will be, it remains obvious that through the generations the Frankfurt School has retained the methodological basis for the critical analysis of Capitalist society, starting criticism under totalitarianism and continuing it in the digital age.",

Some argue for a recovery of \u2018the inspirational quality\u2019 of Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s first-generation negative critique. Certainly the challenge of right-wing populism begs questions of CIRT\u2019s \u2018consolatory\u2019 cosmopolitanism. I have two concerns however. First, these proposals underplay the reasons why first-generation theorising failed; secondly, CIRT risks throwing the second-generation Habermas\u2013Linklater \u2018baby\u2019 out with the \u2018bathwater\u2019 at the moment it has particular value. I do two things. I look back to pre-Habermasian Critical Theory, but I set a future agenda based on the Pragmatism of John Dewey. This helps CIRT realise the emancipatory potential in IR\u2019s recent \u2018practice turn\u2019, addressing concerns that CIRT is disengaged. It also brings balance to negative and positive critiques, offering a novel challenge to critical/problem-solving binaries in ways that speak to real-world challenges like climate change. Second, I look forward from Habermasian-inspired theory to the third-generation (and Pragmatist-inspired) \u2018recognition theory\u2019 of Honneth. This brings a critical edge to IR ontological security studies, further develops the praxeological branch of CIRT, and better informs the political left\u2019s response to the alienating effects of the liberal international order and the rise of right-wing populism.",

The size of the truth of science that Habermas cannot accept when there is Comte's limitations by legitimizing and justifying science through empirical fact research with standardization that has been determined through methodological prerequisites and norms. Habermas with his critical theory rejects this view because there is knowledge that cannot be measured by positivist research methodologies such as community communication and emancipation. On the other hand, Habermas also rejects the notion of value-free science such as Comte's testimony in his positivism because it has indirectly co-opted science with an interest that no longer has objectivity values, but is full of interests.",

Employing a qualitative research methodology, data for this article were obtained through an extensive review of literature, including books, scholarly journals, and other pertinent documents concerning the Frankfurt School\u2019s Critical Theory. Data analysis was performed using content analysis techniques. The findings indicate that the Frankfurt School\u2019s Critical Theory remains a significant philosophical movement, persisting not only in Western academic discourse but also among Muslim philosophers. Despite its limited familiarity in Indonesia, there is potential for the adaptation of aspects and values of the Frankfurt School\u2019s Critical Theory in the educational process. This adaptation could be achieved through the implementation of critical pedagogy, aimed at fostering understanding and sensitivity to promote change. Additionally, the integration of critical religious education could serve to transform it into critical Islamic religious education, thereby challenging the prevailing stigma that often pits Islam and the West against each other in the educational field. Furthermore, it is imperative to acknowledge the significant opportunity for academics and philosophers to continue developing the concept of Islamic Critical Theory, a field that currently has minimal references. Critical theory has the potential to contribute to the development of Islamic scholarship, as evidenced by the Qur\u2019an\u2019s emphasis on critical thinking in the pursuit of knowledge.",

Along with its founding fathers, how do we approach contemporary members of the Frankfurt School whose critical hermeneutics strike a balance between the past and the present? How effectively can the Frankfurt School constellate new insights for contemporary emancipation or, how do we futurize Critical Theory with new radical Freudo-Marxian analysis of authoritarian personalities, the reified culture industry and social one-dimensionality? This project also looks into the critical demerits of the Frankfurt School, investigating whether it has been exclusively Euro-centric in its theoretical complexion, and whether its normative constructionist strands can be enriched by accommodating decolonial world views and polyphonic methodologies, forging the pathways for a new World Critical Theory.",

The article discusses the social-cultural determinants of this transformation, and subsequently the way in which late-modern individualism in the form of self-realization is functionalized by the market and subjected to the requirements of profit and efficiency in individual areas of economic and social life in the neoliberal world. The article refers to the methodology of qualitative sociology.",

It reviews concerns that critics have raised about J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s inheritance of Critical Theory, and it considers several of the alternative paths proposed for charting the Frankfurt School\u2019s future. It argues that, in place of simply reviving the Critical Theory of the 1930s and 1940s, Critical Theory\u2019s reorientation should also consider its diffuse receptions and trajectories among abolitionist, feminist, and left-wing activists and intellectuals in the United States, beginning with the student voices of 1968.",

On July 24, the Institute for Social Research (Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung), the birthplace of critical theory, marked its centennial. A month earlier, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, who is often seen as the intellectual leader of the second generation of the Frankfurt School, celebrated his 95th birthday. In Germany, these overlapping anniversaries have been met with the publication of a number of books on Habermas and the critical theory tradition more generally. Despite the globalization of theorizing within the tradition of the Frankfurt School over the past 50 years, much of its intellectual history of it is still produced in Germany by German scholars based on sources and archives held in the Federal Republic. This Spotlight reviews the main findings and conclusions of this literature for an international, English-speaking audience. It concludes by reflecting on whether critical theory has succeeded\u2014and if so, how.",

In keeping with Gorz\u2019s broader politics, we contend that the utility of his framing of alienation derives from his insistence that progressive critique must challenge the ideal of productivism. We start the paper by presenting a sympathetic reconstruction of Gorz\u2019s understanding of alienation. Next, we explicitly detail the strengths his approach carries for furthering sociological research today. We then reinforce this point by arguing that Gorz\u2019s work offers particularly valuable theoretical resources for contemporary Frankfurt School Critical Theory, in which the study of alienation has been somehow hampered by the ascent of \u2018recognition theory\u2019. While not sharing all the methodological commitments of first-generation Critical Theorists, Gorz was well versed in Frankfurt School scholarship and is therefore an apposite interlocutor to engage \u2018third-generation\u2019 Critical Theory. Gorz\u2019s insights are thus shown to be important for furthering contemporary social theory, and in particular, for helping to combat the unsustainable productivism of neoliberal capitalism.",

The main attention is paid to its place in the history of Marxist social theory and the development of \u00ableft idea\u00bb in the 20th century. In this context, the relationship of the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main, which is the institutional core of the Frankfurt School, with Soviet Marxism is considered, as well as the degree of initial correspondence of the interests of the leaders of the Frankfurt School to the Marxist tradition and the reasons for their gradual departure from Marxism since the 1930s. The non-Marxist nature of the interests and professional and educational background of the leading employees of the Institute and a sharp departure from the original positions of historical materialism after M. Horheimer took the post of Institute\u2019s director are noted. It emphasizes the significant influence on the theoretical development and political position of Frankfurt School\u2019s leaders of the National Socialists\u2019 coming to power in Germany and forced emigration \u2014 unlike their Soviet counterparts patronized by the state, the staff of the Institute found themselves in a situation of socio-political orphanhood. It is noted that the central theme the Frankfurt School\u2019s research after the proclamation in the second half of the 1930s \u00abcritical theory\u00bb as the key methodological reference point, the \u00abauthoritarian personality\u00bb becomes, in which T. Adorno, M. Horheimer, G. Marcuse and E. Fromm (from whose works on the \u00abauthoritarian character\u00bb the development of this topic began) see the basis of social injustice and totalitarianism. It is argued that the concept of \u00abauthoritarian personality\u00bb turns inside out the original historical materialism, characteristic for the studies of the Institute staff in the 1920s, and psychologizes political relations, as well as forms the means of social stigmatization and discrimination of dissidents. This reveals in the views the Frankfurt School leaders themselves signs of an \u00abauthoritarian personality\u00bb and one-dimensionality, which were initially the main objects of criticism for them.",

Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, Theodor W. Adorno, Erich Fromm, and Walter Benjamin are chief proponents of this theory. It is noteworthy how this movement started in Germany during WWII and spreads around the world in 1930s. Conflict theorists interpreted various philosophers\u2019 ideas, especially those of, Karl Marx, Hegel, and Sigmund Freud etc. They dismissed rationality because it can lead to violence and barbarianism if logically justified. The mythological battle of troy, the horrors of holocaust are all examples of how rationality is capable of mass destruction. By 1970s another generation, started by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, initiated the dialogue between continental and analytics tradition. Contrary to the first generation, he did not believe in pessimist understanding of reason and tried to re-establish it without falling in the pit of objectivism. The foremost section is based on a brief biography of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. The later section of the paper enumerates a comparative analysis to see how Habermas perspective on modernity and rationality are different from the first generation of Frankfurt school of thought. The third and fourth section was reserved for the detailed discussion and critique of his ideas. Lastly, the paper asserted as to whether Habermas relevance in the 21st century outweighs his predecessors or not.",

Adorno\u2019s opposition to forms of humanism (both liberal and Marxist) which posit the existence of our humanity is reflected in readings of The Frankfurt Institute\u2019s history such as that produced by Martin Jay. While this is the case, one of Adorno\u2019s highly admired students, Alfred Schmidt, commemorated his teacher by proclaiming him a \u2018philosopher of Real Humanism\u2019. In categorising Adorno\u2019s work as embodying a \u2018Real Humanism\u2019, Schmidt points towards an understanding and orientation towards the human (and our understanding of it) which cannot be accurately characterised through the philosophies of Humanism and Anti-Humanism as oppositional viewpoints. Rather, the Real Humanism of Adorno (as well as some of his fellow travellers) understands the human as the negative image of our currently existing society\u2019s inhumanity, and urges us to take an ethical orientation towards the constitution of the human through the abolition of our inhumanity. If we, like Adorno, are to believe in the new categorical imperative that we must make sure \u2018that Auschwitz never repeats itself, so that nothing similar ever happen[s] again\u2019, then we must fundamentally orient ourselves towards the goal of \u2018real humanism\u2019 \u2013 a society free from the domination of ourselves and the other.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the intellectual legacy of the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory, focusing on its origins, transformations, and intergenerational dialogues. The School's primary objective is to philosophically analyze and critique the social pathologies and contradictions engendered by modern capitalist societies. Influenced by philosophers like Kant, Hegel, and Marx, as well as psychoanalysis and Weberian rationalization debates, the School addressed historical context, capitalism's cultural forms, and new types of social subjectivity. The article traces the evolution from the first generation's critique of modernity and domination (Horkheimer, Adorno), through the innovations of the second generation with Habermas's theory of communicative action, to the contributions of the third generation, particularly Axel Honneth's theory of recognition. It highlights Honneth's effort to center the struggle for recognition within Critical Theory\u2014addressing the perceived shortcomings of previous generations (especially the pessimism of the first generation and the moral experiences overlooked by Habermas's theory)\u2014and provide a new normative foundation. The theory of recognition reveals the moral dimensions underlying social conflicts and emancipatory struggles, emphasizing the importance of intersubjective relations.",

      "abstract": "abstract:The writings of Alfred Sohn-Rethel, an obscure figure on the margins of the Frankfurt School, provide the clearest instance of the project of reconciling Marx\u2019s historical materialism with Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism. Sohn-Rethel\u2019s Marx is an unorthodox Kantian who concedes that objects of knowledge reflect the mind, while insisting that the mind is itself formed by modes of economic production. The categories and forms of intuition derive from the \u201creal abstraction\u201d inherent in the practice of commodity exchange. In situating the transcendental conditions in this practice itself, Sohn-Rethel\u2019s project differs from other attempts (by Cassirer and Heidegger) to socialize and historicize the a priori. Moreover, it has broad philosophical relevance, opening up a rapprochement between neo-Kantian strains of analytic philosophy and Marx. The recent analytic rehabilitation of Hegel provides a possible blueprint.",

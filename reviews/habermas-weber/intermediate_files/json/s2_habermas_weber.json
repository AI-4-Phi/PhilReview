      "abstract": "The relationship between morality and politics has always been one of the central objects for political philosophy. Based on this premise, numerous theories have been developed in order to justify the action of human society. This paper aims to analyze some theories of power legitimation, from the perspective of Max Weber, Jurgen Habermas, and Niklas Luhmann. To fulfill this objective, a qualitative data analysis was performed, based on a bibliographical study correlating the theories of these authors considering the concepts of procedure, language, intersubjectivity, and communication. This allowed creating a panoramic criticism of these theories and projecting their reasoning in society. Finally, this article mainly demonstrates that the theories surrounding communication and procedure, present in both Luhmann and Habermas, are somewhat conflicting, although both seek to understand the mechanisms (social, moral, legal, or political) of legitimation of power.",

      "abstract": "A relacao entre o direito e a moral, na modernidade, foi concebida sob a perspectiva de subordinacao do direito ao conteudo moral ( jusnaturalismo ) e a afirmacao que essas duas esferas normativas sao factualmente distintas e independentes ( positivismo ). Essas perspectivas juridicas nao possibilitam a compreensao do direito moderno como inserido em uma duplice orientacao de imposicao de normas e de busca de legitimacao pela via discursiva. Nas Tanner Lectures de Habermas e apresentado o primeiro experimento da Teoria Critica em considerar o sistema juridico como acessivel ao conteudo normativo da racionalidade comunicativa. Habermas realiza a discussao mediante o estudo da racionalizacao social operada pelo direito. A sociologia de Max Weber fornece o aporte para configurar a estrutura formal do direito e a sua impositividade. A estrutura formal do direito estaria em conflito com a orientacao de bem-estar social que adentrou ao sistema juridico pela orientacao politica. Esse processo e denominado de juridificacao e reflete a ampliacao da regulacao juridica sobre a vida social. Habermas observa que o resgate da relacao entre o direito e a moral podera conter a instrumentalizacao politica do direito e arranja-lo em caracteristicas normativas que expressem a semelhanca com o procedimento moral de deducao de normas.",

Such thought has become a hermeneutic frame of reference for understanding and interpretation of various fields of knowledge, from the standpoint of being, knowledge and political action of being in the world today, hence the emphasis on the relationship between Philosophy and Policy. The general argument that guides the discussion is that the current setting of epistemic ecological thought depends on a philosophical and political ideas gestated by movements advocating the transformation of social thought, the cultural and the political system of the advanced societies of the political context resulting from after World War II. The specific focus of the discussion are the philosophical ideas of Mmax Weber and Jurgen Habermas, with emphasis on the concepts of rational, strategic action/communicative action, respectively. The ideas of these authors converge to explain the environmental thought as having a cultural rationality strategically oriented political action, but communicative tively linked to the world of life.",

Drawing on articles he produced as a freelance journalist before arriving at the Institute for Social Research in 1956\u2014as well as the correspondence contained in the Habermas archives at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main\u2014the article shows that Habermas sought to combine his political and philosophical interests from the start. It argues that these relatively unknown and understudied texts highlight the development of Habermas\u2019s understanding of the relationship of theory to practice and also help explain his attraction to the Frankfurt School in general, as well as to Theodor Adorno specifically.",

In view of this, this paper draws on the core connotation of Habermas' theory of interactional behaviour to analyse the real dilemma of the current mentoring relationship, and to reconstruct the new era of graduate student mentoring relationship of mutual respect, understanding, equality, and harmonious coexistence in terms of four dimensions: interactional rationality, language, life world, and intersubjectivity.",

      "abstract": "How to accurately grasp the relationship between right and power is one of the core propositions of political philosophy, and is also a theoretical issue that Habermas has always paid great attention to. By studying Habermas\u2019s thought of the relationship between right and power, we can not only deeply understand the basic concepts of his political philosophy, but also explore the way of thinking to safeguard civil rights and balance political power. Compared with traditional political philosophy, it is not difficult to find that Habermas neither advocates the separation of right and power as liberals, nor advocates the absolute integration of the two as republicans. In his view, the right to be the outcome of citizens\u2019 spontaneous interaction must rely on coercive political power to enter into force. At the same time, political power can only obtain the legitimacy of existence in accordance with the principle of \u201cpeople\u2019s sovereignty\u201d of the discourse theory, and this legitimacy foundation is precisely reflected in the right system of communication cycle. In short, right and power restrict each other and depend on each other, and they present an isomorphic relationship with moderate tension. Obviously, this view is a historical advance of political philosophy and has great theoretical and practical value.",

Both authors have in fact dedicated specific studies to the sociology of right and have conferred a central function on the norms in order to guarantee a correct functioning of parliamentary democracy. For Weber and Habermas, the norm exists in a constitutive tension between facticity and normativity, i.e. between its factual influence on society and its theoretical legitimacy. Weber distinguishes between the juridicial and the sociological meaning of the norm, which is respectively related to its normative value and to its effects on society. For Habermas, the norm is adhered to, but it also has to be legitimized, and this can only be reached as a consequence of a democratic debate that produces consensus. In the political sphere, Weber and Habermas stress the importance of an interaction between legality and political discussion, democratic procedures and their process of institutionalization, thus emphasizing the necessity of guaranteeing a political debate subject to rules. Nevertheless, their ideas of democracy partially differ. Weber conceives of a democracy based on a majority, whereas Habermas stresses the necessity of reaching an agreement. This article analyzes the different models of democracy articulated by Weber and Habermas, their significance, and the possibility of integration between them.",

Drawing on Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action, we debate prevailing understandings of the implications of his work for deliberative democracy via an exploration of the films. By expanding the definition of the term \u2018motion\u2019 (otherwise known as \u2018draft resolution\u2019), we relate this concept to these Habermasian themes. Thus, this paper analyses feature film case studies as they incorporate motions into fictionalised accounts. We suggest that focusing on these movies\u2019 motions, embedded in unfolding narratives, can help reconceive Habermas\u2019s work to illustrate fluidity in how people and ideas may move between informal and more formal spheres. Ultimately, by showcasing the importance of motions in political participation, via these movies, we advance the idea that motions may be seen as part of a ladder of involvement, providing further opportunities for encouraging participation.",

Although Habermas himself notes that he can, in an unspecified sense, be considered conservative with regard to bioethics, this self-designation does not itself constitute proof. The fact that Habermas\u2019s arguments have been taken up in the bioconservative debate has led some to acknowledge Habermas\u2019s engagement with bioconservatism. However, the clarification of the condition of individual freedom that Habermas proposes in his bioethics mediates the selfhood of the person through the materiality of a biological beginning. Thus, as will be shown, he repeatedly departs from the bioconservative discourse.",

Habermas put forward a theory of communicative action that emphasizes rationality and intersubjective agreement. Meanwhile, Al-Farabi highlighted the importance of virtue and collective purpose in creating an ideal society, and Confucius emphasized the principles of harmony, hierarchical relationships, and the values of politeness. Through qualitative analysis with a literature study approach, this study finds similarities between the three thoughts, namely the importance of a dialogue based on morality that integrates rationality, virtue, and harmony. The proposed model of intercultural communication consists of five main pillars: equality in dialogue, respect for diversity, the search for common truth, the application of virtue, and the achievement of collective harmony. This model is particularly relevant in facing the increasingly urgent challenges of globalization for ethical and inclusive intercultural interactions. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0",

Motroschilova, in particular, her ideas about the specific character of the history of philosophy, the nature of philosophical knowledge and evaluation of the modern Western history of philosophy expressed by her regarding J\u00fcrgen Habermas and his latest two-volume work Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie, form the basis of this article. In considering the specific character of philosophy and its history, Habermas raises the question of the format of modern philosophy. Does post-metaphysical thinking in its two contemporary strains provide a way out of the current state of philosophy? Is it still possible to answer Kant\u2019s questions today? The \u201cmodernizing recollection,\u201d that Habermas offers as a way of considering the history of philosophy, contributes to gaining a new perspective on many traditional problems of the history of philosophy. Both by Motroshilova and by Habermas (who characterized the history of Western philosophy as a process of constant learning and teaching that unfolds between knowledge and faith) special attention is paid to Kant\u2019s philosophy in the aspect of his understanding of the relationship between faith and knowledge. This new reading of Kant offered by Habermas led Motroshilova to new reflections on Kant\u2019s philosophy and, in particular, his basic concepts. The upshot is that the questions of practical reason, its role in the justification of the moral law and its observance by the subject and, of course, the problem of using one\u2019s own mind to achieve happiness and reasonable freedom remain central for both philosophers.",

      "abstract": "More than forty years ago, J. Habermas published his two-volume Theory of Communicative Action in German, encapsulating over twenty years of reflection and research. The core concept of his intellectual pursuits was that the indestructible element of semantic rationality is rooted in the social form of communicative action, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive social theory, safeguarded through modern philosophy of language and science. In this book, as in his other works, J. Habermas intertwines an in-depth examination of theoretical traditions with his systematic argumentation, encompassing a wide range of scientific approaches. Reinterpreted theories from G. Mead, M. Weber, E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, and various versions of Marxism provided a system of conceptual coordinates within which J. Habermas recognized new ideas in social theory and tested those using factual arguments. After the book\u2019s publication, it garnered significant attention from the scientific community, which was remarkable considering the challenges it posed to readers. The initial published responses reflected its thematic complexity and ideological richness; the most common criticism, often expressed with the irony of a \u201chopelessly idealistic enterprise\u201d, was later refuted after deeper discussions. This criticism has persisted and is now supplemented with new arguments, which are countered by other counterarguments. Theory of Communicative Action has been translated into English, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has become the focal point of international discussions about social science theory. Few authors possess the argumentative skill, intellectual history knowledge, thematic breadth, and desire to diagnose the modern world required to address a variety of areas and answer pertinent questions. Those who do not participate in today\u2019s debates or have nothing to say about this influential social theorist effectively exclude themselves from being considered serious connoisseurs. The Russian edition of J. Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, translated by A. K. Sudakov and published by \u201cVes mir\u201d in 2022, was highly anticipated. However, disappointment soon followed when readers discovered the released version. Although the book\u2019s table of contents appears to align with the English translation by T. McCarthy (praised by both the global sociological community and J. Habermas himself), a closer examination of the Russian text reveals that it primarily consists of \u201csimulacra\u201d (semblances) of the original translation. According to J. Baudrillard\u2019s precise definition of \u201csimulacrum,\u201d this means it is merely an \u201cimitation of the non-existent\u201d and gives the impression of something that isn\u2019t truly there. The primary issue is that translator A. K. Sudakov disrupted the key semantic context by replacing the fundamental term \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (\u201chandeln,\u201d or \u201caction\u201d in the English translation) with the unrelated term \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u201ct\u00e4tigkeiten,\u201d \u201cactivity\u201d). From a modern sociological theory perspective, using the term \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (communicative activity) instead of \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (communicative action) is a significant violation of the logical progression and development of initial premises. Habermas formulated his concept of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d based on T. Parsons\u2019 approach to defining \u201caction\u201d as a singular social act, while the category of \u201cactivity\u201d is rooted in an extremely broad definition of \u201chuman activity\u201d. This article examines numerous glaring errors and distortions in the translations that not only affect the semantic structures of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d but also the entirety of modern sociology. As a result, the review is titled \u201cSimulacra of Translation\u201d to highlight these issues through various examples of factual \u201creinterpretations\u201d of the book\u2019s key meanings and concepts.",

Research methodology \u2013 analysis of literature, critical method of comparison of secondary views in the literature on Habermas\u2019 original theses. Descriptive method. Score/results \u2013 views presented by the author of the Legitimation Crisis are based on the works of the representatives of The Frankfurt School. Critical Theory presented in their many works has its development and explication in the works of Habermas, with his innovative solutions to the unsolved problems of the fatalistic diagnosis of the early generation of the Frankfurt School. Habermas attributed a significant importance to the changes in the relationship of work, capital and intersubjective assignment of meaning in various society organisational forms, from traditional to late-capitalist one. His diagnosis of the legitimisation crisis in late-capitalism further points towards his roots in the Frankfurt School. His solution to this problem, related to the communicative actions and a possibility for a rational discourse ending in a consensus and the detailed elements of his analysis of the crisis of legitimisation, shall become a point of analysis in further papers. Originality/value \u2013 J\u00fcrgen Habermas works maintain their importance in the XXI century, especially in the face of further turbulences that await the democratic systems in the European civilization sphere. This work compiles some of the basic elements of the origin of Habermas\u2019 thought, including the references to the Polish works on Habermas that have not been translated into English; and it is a development of the master\u2019s thesis on Habermas\u2019 concept of legitimisation. The paper\u2019s thesis can be further developed as a related analysis in the future papers.",

Finally, the author insists on the legal-philosophical contributions that this theory has made to rethink our legal modernity. The issues surrounding the issue of legitimacy and legality are still the focus of contemporary reflections in legal philosophy, so if we can admit that the problem involves a long and interesting history in which large sections of Western legal philosophy are drawn, then our contemporary philosophical tools, as well as our democratic experiences, seem to us today More conducive to understanding these issues intellectually.

Hegel's ethics of recognition is helpful for overcoming identity politics in the context of the recognition of minorities' religions, since it allows room for the multiple dimensions of recognition to identify agreements and differences and the structure of recognition in the relationship between religion and the state. Habermas and Taylor develop two different Hegelian approaches to multidimensional recognition by focusing on perspectival exchanges (Habermas) and social conceptions of the good (Taylor) when addressing the recognition of minorities' religions in the post-secular democratic state.",

Digitalisation marks a highly ambivalent develop- ment for freedom, democracy and sustainability, which is on the one hand full of oppor- tunities and on the other hand full of risks. Habermas, however, only takes a rudimen- tary look at this development, and in some cases does not take it into account at all. Instead, his version of discourse ethics reveals an astonishingly backward-looking con- ception of democratic discourse, which not least lapses into an idealisation of the old German Federal Republican era. A differently interpreted discourse ethics can effec- tively counter this. At the same time, the difficult question of the relationship between artificial intelligence and liberal democracy can be clarified.",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "The most crucial problem in analyzing problematic violence in Islam is when relating it with text religion. Problematic violence will appear more paradoxical and crucial when trying to legitimize al-Qur'an. When violence and terrorism get legitimacy from al-Qur'an, it will lead to a very risky conclusion; namely, Islam supports violence and terrorism. This is where the hermeneutics of Jurgen Habermas tries to review the problem of interpretation of these verses, especially concerning the theory of communication actions which will be used as an analytical knife in this study. The problem formulation is; how to read verse jihad without using instrumental interpretation and more developed paradigm communicative hermeneutics. The result of this research is that Jurgen Habermas's view will presuppose the formation of an intersubjective relationship in social society. The act of communication aims to reach an understanding between individuals. In relation to religious tolerance, the expected communication is a dialogue in reaching agreement on claims of accuracy in the underlying values \u200b\u200bof each religion on how to build agreement on each religion and that peace is beautiful and violence is terrible. This claim necessitates an interactive dialogue that explores holistic religious values but avoids discussing truth claims considered non-negotiable religious doctrines. When it is applied in the interpretation of the jihad verse, the conclusion that we hope for is the jihad verse cannot abolish the universal value contained in the peace verse.",

      "abstract": "Issues concerning naturalism have increasingly become the subject of philosophical reflections involving ontological, epistemological, and even ethics affairs. The most popular topic for contemporary philosophy has been the relationship between ontological results of Darwinism and epistemology. Despite the varied circumstances of its establishment, naturalism almost always produces recommendations that reflect a worldview much \u201c weaker \u201d (as in the case of Habermas) than the strong one more common among scientism. There are good structural reasons for this difference. The aim of this paper is to elucidate some of distinctive social features of Habermas \u2019 s conception of the human being and its implications in the Theory of Communicative Action (1982). Therefore, it is shown that his anthropology takes a naturalistic and Darwinist perspective in the weak naturalism perspective. In the first part, Darwin \u0301 s legacy is analysed as a research program, and Habermas \u0301 s studies on biological anthropology are compared with the latest research in genetics and palaeontology. In the second part, we will show Habermas \u2019 s proposal to confront an epistemological dualism through a weak non-reductionist naturalism as a critique of modern metaphysics, which structures a new pragmatic realism.",

      "abstract": "Assuming that the social theory developed by Habermas is very similar to that constructed by M. Weber, this article performs a comparative study with the intention of identifying the ways in which Weber and Habermas built the concept of understanding. Both authors chose this concept, each in his own way, as a methodological tool appropriate to the difficulties of the production of scientific knowledge in the social sciences. As much for Weber as for Habermas, knowledge in the social sciences cannot escape the direct influences of the subjectivity of the scientist, as it also cannot protect itself from the historical and cultural contingencies to which every human action is inevitably linked. Therefore, based on their own reasons, both Weber and Habermas point to understanding as the possible form of knowledge, which implies the renunciation of the explanatory pretensions and general theories of ultimate foundations typical of the conventional sciences.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the philosophical debate between Muguerza and Habermas, starting with the meeting of the two in the summer of 1994 in Madrid. To this end, some of the core aspects of their respective ethical and legal thoughts are interpreted and apostilled, both in their agreements and in their disagreements. The text focuses on the controversy between two of their apparently irreducible positions. Namely, the \u201cprimacy of the moral conscience of the individual\u201d, defended by Muguerza, and the \u201cprimacy of the legal law of society\u201d, advocated by Habermas. The paper concludes by suggesting a third approach, which methodically tempers the controversy, in reference to the duality of the \u201cindividual\u201d constituted in-intra-societal relationship, and the \u201csociety\u201d instituted by individuals-in-inter-relationship",

      "abstract": "The public sphere is not always what J\u00fcrgen Habermas imagines, which is inclusive, egalitarian and pressure-free. In the Madurese paternalistic constellation, the dominations of power over the contestation of public opinion and action become prominent in the relationship between participants/actors. A meeting between different interests causes this contestation. The struggle for influence is also shown by the dominance of \u2018capital\u2019 or resources. In Madura, Kiai are considered to have \u2018charismatic\u2019 symbolic capital related to the historical and cultural aspects of the Madurese ethnicity. This makes the figure of Kiai (along with Blater as a twin regime) become the center of consensus-making in a paternalistic public discussion. This phenomenological qualitative research becomes interesting when the world view of the local community is connected with Habermas\u2019 perspective through the idea of European version of the bourgeois public sphere, which is considered not applicable to the local genius Madurese realm. The arena of public sphere in the Tanean Lanjhang pattern and the existence of \u2018langgar\u2019 (mosque) in the social community rejects the characterization of Habermas and brings a new definition of Madurese paternalistic public sphere, which is hegemony-mutualistic, as one of the richness of Indonesian cultural patterns.",

Although both attack J\u00fcrgen Habermas for being an idealist whose philosophy is too removed from politics, I argue that this interpretation is inaccurate. While Habermas\u2019s social and political theory is indeed oriented to truth and understanding, he has sought realize his communicative conception of democracy by increasing the quality of political debate as a public intellectual. Building on his approach, I argue that giving the theorist a direct role in public policy undermines theory as an enterprise oriented towards truth while overlooking the contingency, participatory nature and complicated internal logics of social and political practice. My basic thesis is that Habermas\u2019s understanding of the relationship between theory and practice overcomes these difficulties by providing an account of theory that is independent but simultaneously also allows philosophers to participate in politics as public intellectuals.",

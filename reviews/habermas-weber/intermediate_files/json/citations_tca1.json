            "Legitimation still remains a key theme for Habermas in The Theory of Communicative Action, and the interplay of the system and the lifeworld becomes now central for the analysis of legitimation problems.",
            "The core element in The Theory of Communicative Action is the theory of communicative rationality, a theory containing the famous and much debated argument that consensus is the \u201cinherent telos\u201d of rational speech (Habermas 1984, 287).",
            "The fact that speakers are able to raise and redeem these three kinds of validity claims means also that the speakers know how to relate to the world in three corresponding aspects: they know how to relate to the objective world, the subjective world, and the social world (Habermas 1984, 98\u2013100).",
            "Even though attention is directed here to explanatory-diagnostic aspects in Habermas\u2019s works, the anticipatory-utopian aspects of Habermas\u2019s theory are introduced in this chapter as well, the focus being on the oft-criticized contrafactual ideals presented especially in those Habermas works that have emerged out of his linguistic turn culminating in The Theory of Communicative Action (1984; 1987a) as well as in the works dealing with discourse ethics (see e.g. Habermas 1990; 1993).",
            "These claims are raised on the basis of speaker\u2019s own experience, his or her subjective world, to which the speaker has \u201cprivileged access\u201d (Habermas 1984, 15\u201316).",
            "\u2026work laid out a theory of \u201ccommunicative rationality\u201d, a form of rationality that is inherent in our language use and that \u201ccarries with it connotations based ultimately on the central experience of the unconstrained, unifying, consensus-bringing force of argumentative speech\u201d (Habermas 1984, 10).",
            "Although Habermas (1984) by no means denies the central role of strategic and instrumental rationality in contemporary societies, and although he well recognizes that we also often utilize language to pursue our goals strategically, he maintains that strategic language use is derivative of the\u2026",
            "\u2026of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d, a concept referring to a form of collective action that is coordinated rationally through speech, and more precisely, through harmonization of our action plans on the basis of normative agreement and shared definition of the situation at hand (Habermas 1984, 86, 101).",
            "Habermas (1984; 1987a) argues that this \u201ccommunicative\u201d and emancipatory form of rationality exists in modern capitalist societies, even though its realization is often severely hindered because of the intrusion of the strategic and instrumental rationalities of the systems of economy and\u2026",
            "Therefore, the concept of the lifeworld largely replaces the concept of the socio-cultural system in The Theory of Communicative Action.",
            "Habermas starts from this differentiation, prioritizing illocutionary acts, which are related in his theory to the practice of understanding and accepting speech acts (Habermas 1984, 11; see also Warnke 1995, 121).",
            "Does the language-use in the internet-based fora have \u201cbinding\u201d and \u201cbonding\u201d force in the same way that Habermas argues it to have in the face-to-face communication (cf. Habermas 1984, 302; 1987a, 77)?",
            "The raising of these three different validity claims means that the speaker is at least implicitly claiming that what he says is true, that he means what he says, and what he says fits its normative context or that the normative context is itself legitimate (Habermas 1984, 99).",
            "Communicative planning theory made its breakthrough during the late 1980s and 1990s, soon after the publication of the English translation of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s colossal two-volume work The Theory of Communicative Action (Habermas 1984; 1987a).",
            "Because of this implicit warranty that speakers offer in validity claims for their hearers, Habermas calls illocutionary force a \u201cbinding\u201d and \u201cbonding\u201d force (see e.g. Habermas 1984, 302; 1987a, 77).",
            "The plurality of identities is a theme that Habermas assesses particularly in his works published after The Theory of Communicative Action, such as Between Facts and Norms (Habermas 1996; see also Habermas 1998a; Hillier 2002, 39\u201342).",
            "After The Theory of Communicative Action, however, Habermas revises his view on this issue and begins to assess law primarily as an institution belonging to the context of the lifeworld (section 2.7; see also Deflem 2008; 2013; Habermas 1996).",
            "\u2026see also section 2.3.2) to discursive justifiability of the exercise of power (Habermas 1979), or from the legality of the use of power to the questions related to normative justifiability of legal norms and of the institution of law in general (Habermas 1984; 1987a; 1996; see also section 2.7).",
            "Furthermore, the participants of discourses must presuppose that there are no other motives involved in the process than the one of reaching understanding, and that the only force influencing the processes is \u201cthe force of the better argument\u201d (Habermas 1984, 25).",
            "However, this claim can also be associated with the contextual conditions of an utterance (Habermas 1984, 22).",
            "As previously mentioned, in The Theory of Communicative Action, the concepts of the system and of the lifeworld refer to two different research approaches or two different perspectives to society.",
            "Habermas maintains, contrary to many modern moral theorists\u2019 views, that questions concerning normative validity, just as questions concerning truth, can be assessed rationally and cognitively (Habermas 1984, 18).",
            "We can assess the expressions of self, for instance, by observing what kinds of consequences they have and whether they are consistent with the speaker\u2019s behaviour (cf. Habermas 1984, 15)."

            "My research began with an interest in the indigenous Oromo people who had practiced an egalitarian and participatory democracy known as the gadaa/siqqee system(19) (Jalata & Schaffer, 2013), before their colonization by the combined forces of European imperialism and Ethiopian colonialism during the last decades of the nineteenth century (Holcomb & Ibssa, 1990; Jalata, 1993, 2010). The historical legacy of Oromo political leadership is the sovereignty the Oromo people experienced under the siqqee/gadaa government and its egalitarian framework. I also have been studying the relationship between various indigenous peoples and the capitalist world system (Jalata, 2013a). Because of my varied research experiences, I have come to understand and appreciate the importance of developing multicultural-centric and critical interdisciplinary scholarship, and submitting my methods to critical scrutiny as necessary steps for developing a human-centric emancipatory social theory. As Edward Said (2001 [1978], p.",
            "societies are purported to foster (see Ingram, 2010; this applies to an even greater extent to Honneth\u2019s recognition paradigm; see Petherbridge, 2013). In terms of the analysis presented in this essay, however, such a theory of modern society inevitably replicates features of this form of social organization and process in general, and more importantly, features that are highly problematic and likely to drop out of sight, especially if and to the degree that they suggest that the link between modern society and humanist and justice-oriented values is more disconcerting than commonly recognized, in a very specific manner that is neither immediately apparent, nor readily discernible. Still, in two regards, the above-quoted passage from The Theory of Communicative Action (Habermas, 1984 [1981], 1987 [1981]) is astonishingly pertinent, though not in the manner intended.",
            "In fact, the reason that there was a need for the kind of critique he developed, especially in the form of his critique of political economy, was that the idea of science that inspired political economy in the sense of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, in particular, was categorically incapable of assessing, explaining, and evaluating the social and historical significance of the process they claimed to illuminate: the modern capitalist market economy (Marx, 1978 [1844]).",
            "nation-states have \u201cstandardized time and space and codified race, gender, and class into law\u201d (Roy, 2001, p. xvii). Mainstream Euro-American elites and their collaborators in the Rest have constructed various social theories to naturalize and justify the socially constructed reality of race, gender, and class hierarchies. \u201cSubordinate groups, especially subordinate races, are often seen as \u2018primitive\u2019 or \u2018backward\u2019 belonging to the past. If they work hard and play by the (white) rules, they can eventually \u2018catch up.\u2019 Similarly, the upper classes are seen as \u2018head\u2019 of the poor. They use the newest technology, wear the newest fashions, and understand the latest trends\u201d (Roy, 2001, p. 27). Racist and some modernist theorists have denied that the concepts and practices of race, gender, and class have been socially constructed by elites as well as by dominant institutions (see Harrison, 1998; Jalata, 2001). By denying that somebody\u2019s knowledge and skills depend on accessibility to resources and education, they assert that people who belong to subaltern social categories are intellectually deficient because of their lack of intelligence. For them, consequently, social hierarchies are natural and investable. These theorists have established intelligence tests based on their cultural experiences that cannot measure \u201ca person\u2019s general ability to interact in the real world .... Psychologists have ... challenged the notion of intelligence implicit in intelligence testing by questioning whether there is a single quality that people have or whether there are multiple intelligences\u201d (Roy, 2001, p. 2). Racists and some modernists have also denied the existence of multicultural knowledge and wisdoms and promoted the notion of the intellectual superiority of Euro-Americans; they have also denied the diversity of intelligences. According to Gardner (1983), there are seven forms of intelligence, namely linguistic (i.",

            "Having developedhis theory of communication action,Habermas' next concerns are to present a two-level conceptof society (systemand lifeworld) anddemonstrate the pathologies that arisewhen the steeringmedia of the system (money and power) replace and disturb the communicative action in the lifeworld. These concerns are addressed by first understanding that communicative action takes place against the backdrop of the lifeworld \u2014 a background of implicit, pre-reflective knowledge (Habermas, 1987). Habermas uses Husserl's definition of lifeworld as consisting of \u201cindividual skills, the intuitive knowledge of how one deals with a situation; and from socially acquired practices, the intuitive knowledge of what one can rely on in a situation, not less than, in a trivial sense, the underlying convictions\u201d (Habermas, 1987: 35). As we have seen, when people fail to reach agreement in communication (that is, when validity claims have become problematic), they move to discourse to re-establish agreement. When the background of knowledge upon which individuals draw is (relatively) shared, the need to move to discourse is less frequently experienced. However, as societies have grown increasingly complex and diverse, Habermas argues that the ability to reach agreement becomesmore strained and the need tomove communication to the level of discourse becomes more frequent. As a result, systems have emergedwhich relieve thenecessity of having to reach agreement on every issue. In Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas (1987) identifies two main sub-systems: the economic system and thepolitical system.",

The second type of action is determined by the desire to gain success in the social sphere, where power can be manifested as influence, generating strategic activity (action). Communicative action, as a third type of action set out by Habermas in his critical reading of Weber on success, subscribes to sphere of mutual understanding (1984; 1987; 2000).

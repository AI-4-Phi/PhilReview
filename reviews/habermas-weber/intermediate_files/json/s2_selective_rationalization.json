      "abstract": "Max Weber characterized modernity as a state of disenchantment, in which rationalization strips the world of sacred meaning. To counter political apathy, he suggested that democratic elections could generate quasi-charisma, infusing sterile bureaucratic rule with symbolic energy. This essay interrogates whether such democratic charisma can truly heal the spiritual deficit of modern life. Drawing on recent critiquesincluding Storms claim that enchantment never vanished and Marottas refined model of demagificationit argues that democratic charisma is structurally frail. While elections, media spectacles, and populist appeals may momentarily mobilize affect, they remain embedded in the very legalrational procedures that produce disenchantment. As a result, quasi-charisma offers only transient simulations of meaning that are easily routinized or manipulated. By exposing these limits, the paper illuminates the persistent tension between efficient governance and authentic collective belief, a dilemma central to contemporary populism and declining institutional distrust.",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "The article discusses a key issue for Russian and international Max Weber Studies: the epistemological possibilities and place of Weberian sociology in modern social theory. Discussion articles by well-known Russian scientists \u2014 who sharply criticized the actualizing direction of Weberian studies in general, and the religious, cultural, and sociological orientation in particular \u2014 are contrasted with the re-actualization and rethinking of key Weberian themes in the \u201cNew Critical Theory\u201d of the influential German sociologist Hartmut Rosa. Such a projection will make it possible, on the one hand, to thematize the axiomatic assertion about the heuristic rather than concrete-content relevance of the classics; on the other hand, it will provide an opportunity to read Weber as a macrosociologist. In the original, criticized, and often rejected sociology of Rosa, Weber appears not only as a predecessor whose mention enhances the relevance of the new theoretical framework, but, above all, as an analyst and diagnostician of early modernity. Weber\u2019s main ideas and theoretical constructions are organically built into Rosa\u2019s methodological framework: analysis-diagnosis-praxis. The analysis of rationalization as a universal historical process of modernity in Weber\u2019s sociology is rethought by Rosa as expansion and acceleration; disenchantment becomes a diagnosis of modernity and is recoded into alienation, while the concept of charisma is transformed into the key concept of resonance.",

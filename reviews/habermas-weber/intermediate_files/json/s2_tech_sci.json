The 1896 Bombay case demonstrates how scientific authority functioned despite the absence of effective outcomes, while the early twentieth-century Madras case reveals how even scientifically validated achievements (e.g., Haffkine\u2019s vaccine) were suppressed for political reasons. These cases illustrate how scientific rationality was refracted through colonial ideology\u2015a process rooted in the institutional reorganization of medical knowledge following the 1835 Macaulay Education Policy. This policy systematically marginalized traditional medicine, such as Ayurveda, stigmatizing it as \u201cunscientific.\u201d Through this analysis, I demonstrate that medical systems functioned not merely as therapeutic technologies but as complex sites where state power, science, and culture intersected. By critically illuminating the epistemic foundations of colonial medicine justified in the name of science, this study indicates Canguilhem\u2019s theory of scientific ideology as a critical theoretical resource for constructing a decolonial epistemology of medicine.",

      "abstract": "The article uses an interdisciplinary approach combining political science, philosophical and socio-cultural per-spectives. The emphasis is on the moral, value, and ideological aspects of political irony in memes. The issues of moral responsibility of the subject are presented from the point of view of deontology and utilitarianism (Kant, Mill). The value conflicts encoded in the meme are analyzed through the ideas of the Frankfurt School and the \u201cfriend\u2013foe\u201d dichotomy (Arendt, Habermas). The ideological function of memes is interpreted through critical theory, taking into account the concepts of \u201chegemony\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d (Gramsci, Foucault). The following memes are selected for analysis: \u201cDistracted Boyfriend\u201d, \u201cDrake Posting\u201d (Drake Meme), \u201cBayan\u201d (accordion), \u201cWoman yelling at Cat\u201d (Woman Yelling at Cat). These memes combine rational and irrational narratives, and irony is closely linked to the dynamics of the political process. The political irony in Internet memes is not ethi-cally neutral. Political Internet memes accumulate value conflicts and changes in the subject\u2019s value expecta-tions. Memes have a high ideological potential. Despite their apparent lightness and superficiality, they reveal serious disagreements in society and point to the complex processes accompanying the formation of the politi-cal consciousness of Internet users.",

Habermas was critique to postmodernism that universal as hegemony and discriminative to getting a plural morality Habermas's critical theory is a kind of epistemology that seeks to mate between objectivity and subjectivity, between scientists and philosophers, between the ontentic and the articulate. Critical theory also tries to expose the traditional theory, because it positions the object as untouchable, as it is. So difficult to capture its meaning by humans. This makes the object seem very sacred and must be received unanimously. The democracy of Habermas is deliberative democracy. Deliberative democracy aims to find a middle ground between Western liberalism and Asian and Islamic communitism. This assumption is established in a democratic form in the form of an intensive political system and public sphere.",

      "abstract": "More than forty years ago, J. Habermas published his two-volume Theory of Communicative Action in German, encapsulating over twenty years of reflection and research. The core concept of his intellectual pursuits was that the indestructible element of semantic rationality is rooted in the social form of communicative action, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive social theory, safeguarded through modern philosophy of language and science. In this book, as in his other works, J. Habermas intertwines an in-depth examination of theoretical traditions with his systematic argumentation, encompassing a wide range of scientific approaches. Reinterpreted theories from G. Mead, M. Weber, E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, and various versions of Marxism provided a system of conceptual coordinates within which J. Habermas recognized new ideas in social theory and tested those using factual arguments. After the book\u2019s publication, it garnered significant attention from the scientific community, which was remarkable considering the challenges it posed to readers. The initial published responses reflected its thematic complexity and ideological richness; the most common criticism, often expressed with the irony of a \u201chopelessly idealistic enterprise\u201d, was later refuted after deeper discussions. This criticism has persisted and is now supplemented with new arguments, which are countered by other counterarguments. Theory of Communicative Action has been translated into English, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has become the focal point of international discussions about social science theory. Few authors possess the argumentative skill, intellectual history knowledge, thematic breadth, and desire to diagnose the modern world required to address a variety of areas and answer pertinent questions. Those who do not participate in today\u2019s debates or have nothing to say about this influential social theorist effectively exclude themselves from being considered serious connoisseurs. The Russian edition of J. Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, translated by A. K. Sudakov and published by \u201cVes mir\u201d in 2022, was highly anticipated. However, disappointment soon followed when readers discovered the released version. Although the book\u2019s table of contents appears to align with the English translation by T. McCarthy (praised by both the global sociological community and J. Habermas himself), a closer examination of the Russian text reveals that it primarily consists of \u201csimulacra\u201d (semblances) of the original translation. According to J. Baudrillard\u2019s precise definition of \u201csimulacrum,\u201d this means it is merely an \u201cimitation of the non-existent\u201d and gives the impression of something that isn\u2019t truly there. The primary issue is that translator A. K. Sudakov disrupted the key semantic context by replacing the fundamental term \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (\u201chandeln,\u201d or \u201caction\u201d in the English translation) with the unrelated term \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u201ct\u00e4tigkeiten,\u201d \u201cactivity\u201d). From a modern sociological theory perspective, using the term \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (communicative activity) instead of \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (communicative action) is a significant violation of the logical progression and development of initial premises. Habermas formulated his concept of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d based on T. Parsons\u2019 approach to defining \u201caction\u201d as a singular social act, while the category of \u201cactivity\u201d is rooted in an extremely broad definition of \u201chuman activity\u201d. This article examines numerous glaring errors and distortions in the translations that not only affect the semantic structures of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d but also the entirety of modern sociology. As a result, the review is titled \u201cSimulacra of Translation\u201d to highlight these issues through various examples of factual \u201creinterpretations\u201d of the book\u2019s key meanings and concepts.",

Therefore, the harmonious issue of supervisor-postgraduate relationship becomes an academic hot-spot. However, daily supervisor-postgraduate relationship is affected by the universal application of instrumental reason. In view of this, this paper draws on the core connotation of Habermas' theory of interactional behaviour to analyse the real dilemma of the current mentoring relationship, and to reconstruct the new era of graduate student mentoring relationship of mutual respect, understanding, equality, and harmonious coexistence in terms of four dimensions: interactional rationality, language, life world, and intersubjectivity.",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "Major books like Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie (AGP)1 start from and develop a single (although complex) idea. This idea has been present inHabermas\u2019swork for some time. It can be traced back to the core project of the Frankfurt School, in the traditionofHorkheimer andAdorno\u2019sDialectic of EnlightenmentandHorkheimer\u2019sCritique of Instrumental Reason, of reconstructing the genesis of and criticizing one-sided forms of rationality that lead to positivism, scientism, and other reductionist accounts of morality and social life.2 The critique of naturalism that Habermas developed over the past 20 years and leads to AGPmarks themost recent development of this theme; however, it has been a life-long preoccupation, if one thinks, for example, of Technik undWissenschaft als \u2018Ideologie\u2019 from 1968. When it comes to reflecting onmodernity, orwhatHabermas nowcalls \u201centgleisendeModerne\u201d (derailedmodernity), discussions of religion have not been absent from his work either, if one thinks, for example, of some of his reflections on Bloch, Scholem, Benjamin, Horkheimer, and Adorno. Take, for example, his analysis of Benjamin\u2019s alternative to ideology critique, namely, \u201crettende Kritik\u201d (redemptive or salvaging critique), which tries to hold onto the moments of the past that had the\u2014to a certain extent messianic\u2014potential to save us from a path of historical catastrophe.3 Furthermore, in dialogues with theologians he developed the idea of a \u201ctranscendence from within,\u201d4 which he still upholds. Although AGP is part of this long series of reflections, it has, as far as I can see, a more determinate occasion and starting point. It dates back to the period around 2000 when Habermas combined his reflections on the work of John Rawls\u2014and the idea (whichwe shared) that religious views had to \u201ctranslate\u201d5 their arguments into a secular language of public reason\u2014with his critique of liberal eugenics. At the end of his book on The Future of Human Nature (German original 2001)6 as well as in his Peace Prize Speech from the same year,7 he asks whether we have\u2014or could have\u2014a good secular translation within the limits of a rational morality (Vernunftmoral) of the religious idea that we are not authorized to \u201cplay God\u201d and determine the nature and fate of human beings by means of biogenetic engineering. In this context, he formed the idea of a twofold or reciprocal translation process, such that not only religious views have",

This article investigates the interconnection of Schiller's \u00dcber die \u00e4sthetische Erziehung des Menschen and Adorno's Theorie der Halbbildung. Schiller foresaw the instrumental rationalism Adorno described as a consequence of Enlightenment and suggested that aesthetic education as a significant part of Bildung would be the protection against it. I interpret Schiller's philosophy as dialectical and him as a precursor of both critical theory and a hermeneutic/phenomenological understanding of art. This article analyzes aesthetic playfulness as a creation of emotional and rational experimental spaces that have an important impact on ethical and political formation.",

      "abstract": "In their seminal work, Dialectics of Enlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno\n interpreted capitalism as the irrational monetization of nature. In the\n present work, I analyze three 21st century concepts, Anthropocene,\n Capitalocene and Machinocene, in light of Horkheimer and Adorno?s arguments\n and recent arguments from the philosophy of biology. The analysis reveals a\n remarkable prescience of the term ?instrumental reason?, which is present in\n each of the three concepts in a profound and cryptic way. In my\n interpretation, the term describes the propensity of science based on the\n notion of physicalism to interpret nature as the machine analyzable and\n programmable by the human reason. As a result, the Anthropocene concept is\n built around the mechanicist model, which may be presented as the metaphor\n of the car without brakes. In a similar fashion, the Machinocene concept\n predicts the emergence of the mechanical mind, which will dominate nature in\n the near future. Finally, the Capitalocene concept turns a perfectly\n rational ambition to expand knowledge into an irrational obsession with\n over-knowledge, by employing the institutionalized science as the engine of\n capitalism without brakes. The common denominator of all three concepts is\n the irrational propensity to legitimize self-destruction. Potential avenues\n for countering the effects of ?instrumental reason? are suggested.",

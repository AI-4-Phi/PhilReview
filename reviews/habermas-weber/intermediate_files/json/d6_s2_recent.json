Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to examine the concept of pseudo-activity as formulated by Theodor W. Adorno, establishing a dialogue with the proposal of the end of the labor society, offering a reflection in light of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s perspective. Both thinkers are associated with the critical tradition of the Frankfurt School, although they present different approaches regarding the implications of modernity for work, culture, and the public sphere. Adorno criticizes rationalization and mass culture, considering them instruments of dehumanization in social and labor interactions. This dynamic generates practices that, although seemingly emancipatory, in fact perpetuate the logic of the system. In this context, pseudo-activity emerges as a form of simulated action, disconnected from any real transformation of social structures. Habermas, for his part, although heir to Adornian criticism, redirects the focus of analysis to communicative rationality, highlighting the relevance of public discourse and democratic deliberation. His view of the post-industrial society or a collapsing labor society provides a theoretical basis for understanding current changes in the role of labor and the emergence of fragmented issues. Based on this theoretical articulation, the article analyzes the consequences of the replacement of socioeconomic agendas by identity-based issues in the public domain, especially from the 1990s onward, influenced by neoliberalism and the technological revolution.",

      "abstract": "Max Weber characterized modernity as a state of disenchantment, in which rationalization strips the world of sacred meaning. To counter political apathy, he suggested that democratic elections could generate quasi-charisma, infusing sterile bureaucratic rule with symbolic energy. This essay interrogates whether such democratic charisma can truly heal the spiritual deficit of modern life. Drawing on recent critiquesincluding Storms claim that enchantment never vanished and Marottas refined model of demagificationit argues that democratic charisma is structurally frail. While elections, media spectacles, and populist appeals may momentarily mobilize affect, they remain embedded in the very legalrational procedures that produce disenchantment. As a result, quasi-charisma offers only transient simulations of meaning that are easily routinized or manipulated. By exposing these limits, the paper illuminates the persistent tension between efficient governance and authentic collective belief, a dilemma central to contemporary populism and declining institutional distrust.",

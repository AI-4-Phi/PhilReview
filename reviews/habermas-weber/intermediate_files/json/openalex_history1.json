      "abstract": "abstract Scholars in management and economics widely share the assumption that business firms focus on profits only, while it is the task of the state system to provide public goods. In this view business firms are conceived of as economic actors, and governments and their state agencies are considered the only political actors. We suggest that, under the conditions of globalization, the strict division of labour between private business and nation\u2010state governance does not hold any more. Many business firms have started to assume social and political responsibilities that go beyond legal requirements and fill the regulatory vacuum in global governance. Our review of the literature shows that there are a growing number of publications from various disciplines that propose a politicized concept of corporate social responsibility. We consider the implications of this new perspective for theorizing about the business firm, governance, and democracy.",

      "abstract": "In his political interventions, J\u00fcrgen Habermas is a first-class rhetorician. His writing style is eloquent, polemical, rich in aper\u00e7us and metaphors, and often affective, especially angry (see M\u00f6llers, 2021, p. 85). But there are also many metaphors in his contributions to philosophy, social theory, and political theory in which he clearly restrains himself rhetorically. Metaphors appear at crucial points in his theory formation. Formulations like the dialogical give and take of reasons \"in kleiner M\u00fcnze\" (small coins), the discursive \"Verfl\u00fcssigung\" (liquefaction) of traditions, the \"colonization\" of the lifeworld, the \"center and periphery\" of modern democracies, or their institutional \"sluices\"\u2014a metaphor he has adopted from Bernhard Peters\u2014create suggestive images in the minds of his readers. The author, who insists on the strict differentiation between day-to-day language, literary language, and the language of the social sciences (see Habermas, 1990a), and whose philosophical self-understanding insists on the \"unforced force of the better argument\" is a master of evocative metaphors. This attribute alone makes it a pleasure to read his texts. The German edition of his new book does not disappoint those readers in search of metaphors either. In the Marxist tradition (see Marx, 2011), a number of metaphors are borrowed from the sphere of geology: \"segments\" (p. 33)1 of the population, \"erosion\" of democracy (p. 87), normative \"slopes\" (p. 15), the \"crumbling\" of the political system (p. 109), or the \"solidified lava\" of anti-authoritarianism in Silicon Valley (p. 46). Some of the metaphors are nautical like normative \"anchors\" (p. 16), or from the theatre, like the \"grimace\" of libertarian political thought (p. 46). Only a few of them belong to organic life: the \"root ground\" of political culture (p. 32), the \"Gleichurspr\u00fcnglichkeit\" (co-originality) of democracy and the rule of law (p. 90), or the \"nesting\" of normative expectations (p. 14). Most of Habermas' metaphors belong to the vocabulary of the technical world: the \"building\" of modern democracy (p. 9), \"centrifugal\" forms of communication (p. 43), the \"architecture\" of constitutional democracy (p. 32), the \"net of historical memory\" (p. 30), the \"Sollbruchstelle\" (predetermined breaking point) of political rights (p. 92), the \"web of attitudes\" (p. 30), the \"social bond\" (p. 31), civil society as an \"early warning system\" (p. 80)\u2014and again the \"flow chart\" of the political system and its \"filters\" and \"sluices\" (p. 24, 100). One has to wait until the last paragraph of the book to find a military metaphor. Now is the time \"den Spie\u00df umzudrehen\"2 (p. 109) and fight the coalition of conspiracy theorists and right-wing populists. Taking Habermas' preference for technical metaphors into account, it comes as no surprise that he has speaks of \"echo chambers\" (p. 45) and \"fragmentation\" (p. 45) in his critical analysis of the digital public sphere. The spatial metaphor of \u00f6ffentlicher Raum (Raum can literally be translated as unlimited space and as clearly limited room) is combined with the technical vocabulary of systems-theory when he mentions the \"input,\" \"throughput,\" and \"output\" components of the institutional infrastructure of the public sphere (pp. 38\u201339). In one passage of the book, Habermas even addresses the problems of metaphorical writing and states that his metaphor Raum \"must not be overstated\" (p. 60). He may have written this sentence from an unfortunate experience. More than once he has become the victim of his metaphor-rich writing style as critics have claimed that formulations like the \"colonization of the lifeworld\" are too vague to have real analytical power in the field of social research. Another example is the term \"ideal speech situation.\" Habermas originally developed the ideal speech situation 1970 in On the Pragmatics of Social Interaction as an epistemological tool used to test the validity of what is essentially true or actually the case (see Habermas, 2001). In this new book, Habermas once again pushes back vehemently against the \"stubborn misunderstanding\" (p. 69) about this term. First, he points out that he has not used \"this misleading expression\" since his 1972 essay on theories of truth. Second, the catchy formulation was never meant to be a blueprint for political institutions, but as a metaphor for the bundle of pragmatic assumptions that we actually always have to start from when we enter into a discourse about validity claims. Nevertheless, some early advocates of the digital revolution in the first half of the 1990s like Howard Rheingold, Nicolas Negroponte, or WIRED magazine authors like John Katz used Habermas' notions of the ideal speech situation and the unrestricted flow of communication in the public sphere as justification for their dreams of a new virtual democracy.3 According to them, the World Wide Web was the technical incarnation of the ideal speech situation. In their view, the Internet matches all basic requirements of a public sphere that comes as close as possible to the normative core of deliberative democracy: The World Wide Web as the communicative infrastructure for open, unlimited, universal, anti-hierarchical, and complex political interaction. To the radical techno-optimists of those days, the Internet created a new political model, since it offered universal access, freedom of expression, unrestricted agendas, uncoerced communication, and political participation outside of traditional political institutions. Habermas reminds the readers of his new book of the big \"emancipatory promise\" of the \"egalitarian and unregulated\" (p. 45) communicative relationships that were propagated at the beginning of the digital age. And indeed, the positive qualities attributed to political communication in the Internet by Rheingold and other optimists of electronic democracy in the 1990s strikingly resemble Habermas' vocabulary (see Buchstein, 1997, pp. 250\u2013251). In his book The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas defined the public sphere as \"a virtually present network of communication\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) that is freed from any spatiotemporally restricted context. Ten years later, in his outline of the deliberative democratic ideal, he advocated a \"decentred society\" in which \"subjectless forms of communication [\u2026] regulate the flow of deliberations\" (Habermas, 1994, p. 7). According to him, \"technologies of communication [\u2026] make possible a highly differentiated network of public spheres\" (Habermas, 1990b, p. 360), The public sphere should consist of an \"open and inclusive network of overlapping, subcultural politics having fluid temporal, social, and substantial boundaries\" (Habermas, 1998, p. 306). In such a \"discursive structuring of public networks and arenas,\" popular sovereignty \"becomes anonymous\" (Habermas, 1998, p. 171). In his new book, Habermas describes digital technology as a third evolutionary stage in the development of means for communication, following the writing of the spoken word a couple of thousand years ago and the introduction of the mechanical printing press at the beginning of early modernity. Despite the \"revolutionary\" (p. 41) change caused by digital technologies, he insists (again) on the social and political neutrality of new technologies. This position\u2014already taken in the late 1960s by Herbert Marcuse\u2014distinguishes Habermas' argument from two rival positions within the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. On the one hand, it departs from the optimistic positions taken by Walter Benjamin in his famous 1936 essay about the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction or Hans-Magnus Enzensberger's Baukasten zu einer Theorie der Medien (1970). On the other hand, it also distances itself from Theodor W. Adorno's critique of alienated consumer culture and the thesis that the essence of the public sphere has been liquidated in the system of mass media in post-liberal societies. Habermas stated in 1992 that the strong influence of Adorno's theory of mass culture was not difficult to discern in the first edition of Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere 30 years ago (see Habermas, 1992, p. 438). There is an element of coquetry in this retrospective statement because already in the early 1960s he had made the point that the consumerist public sphere in a capitalist society should and could be transformed into a more democratic postbourgeois public sphere. The solution he offered in a less known Encyclopedia article from 1964 was a call for political intervention in order to create \"a rational reorganization of social and political power\" (Habermas, 1974, p. 55). The public sphere should be brought \"under the mutual control of rival organizations committed to the public sphere in their internal structure as well as in their relations with the state and each other\" (Habermas, 1974, p. 55). This sounds like an early neo-corporatist expansion of the way public TV was organized in West Germany in those days. Based on his neutralist position, Habermas already in the very beginning of his work about the public sphere more than 60 years ago subscribed to a strategy of state intervention in order to re-regulate the media system. His considerations in The Theory of Communicative Action of 1981 followed the same pattern. Relying on empirical research, he argued\u2014explicitly against Adorno\u2014that even in shifting from writing to images and sounds, electronic media\u2014movie, radio, and TV\u2014have not turned mass media into an apparatus that completely dominates and permeates the language of everyday communication. Instead, he emphasized the \"ambivalence\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) of modern mass media. But the \"unleashing\" of the \"emancipatory potential,\" which is \"built into communicative structures themselves,\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) in the mass media has to be set into action by political measures. Habermas even mentioned Hans Magnus Enzensberger's vision of \"video pluralism\" and \"television democracy\" as attempts to overcome the centralizing media networks in this context. Since then, Habermas has stated repeatedly that modern mass media could both strengthen or undermine the rationality of political communication, depending on the way the infrastructure of the public sphere is regulated (see Habermas, 1992, p. 437). Thirty years after Habermas first published his seminal book about the public sphere stated that there was \"cause for a less pessimistic assessment\" (Habermas, 1992, p. 457) of it and of the future of democracy itself. Another 30 years later, Habermas seems to have returned to pessimism. In his new book, Habermas repeats older statements about the importance of an accommodating, enlightened liberal political culture as the necessary condition for the existence and further development of a democratic political order. His optimism about the further development of western democracies when he published the book Between Facts and Norms in 1992 was still based on his hypothesis about the long-term trend toward a rationalization of the lifeworld. Thanks to the support of post-conventional socialization patterns, families and groups of citizens enter a higher stage of cognitive and moral rationality within their everyday face-to-face communication that also radiates into political communication. As is well known, he adopted the concept of civil society from Andrew Arato and Jean Cohen and turned it into the institutional source for progressive changes of reasons, values, and topics that get transmitted via mass media to the center of the political system. He described civil society as a context of discovery of morally relevant questions arising from the lifeworld. He thus assumed that the lifeworld had a rational advantage in the perception of social problems that were to be transported via social movements and the voluntary associations of civil society into the public sphere. Habermas' overly positive evaluation of social movements and civil society in Between Facts and Norms ignored the fact that a number of voluntary associations already at that time pursued conservative, reactionary, populist, and militant right-wing political goals (see Buchstein, 1994, pp. 107\u2013108). He restricted his considerations about civil society to the question of whether, and to what extent, a public sphere dominated by mass media could provide a realistic chance for the members of civil society to bring about political changes. In Between Facts and Norms, he was relatively optimistic about the possibility of further democratization. In his new book, Habermas is less optimistic. He puts more emphasis on the \"vulnerability\" (p. 30) of the results of socialization patterns and the precarious status of liberal democracies. He states \"political regression\" (p. 41) of liberal democracies around the world seems to have less confidence in the rationalization of the lifeworld. There is a reason for this growing pessimism that has nothing to do with the current Zeitgeist, but follows from a subtle change in Habermas' theory. At first glance, it seems that he is only updating his considerations about the organizational structure of the new media in order to make his argument about the new structural transformation. Both the neutralist position and the state-intervention strategy for a politics of reform and regulation can be found in his book again. Once again, he frames his reflections about the public sphere within his theory of deliberative democracy. He argues that the democratic legitimacy of modern democracies is based on the inclusiveness of the political public sphere. Mass media have an indispensable function, as they ensure the participation of citizens in a common, albeit anonymous, mass communication. Political opinions can only condense into effective public opinions and thus have a targeted influence on political decisions via the publicity of the mass media. Thus, it is imperative that the mass media have an \"enlightening quality\" (p. 23). The centrifugal dissolution of the limits of the simultaneously accelerated political communication to any number of participants at any distance has an \"ambivalent explosive force\" (p. 43). Referring to results of empirical research, Habermas notes that the deliberative quality of political communication in the internet is still an \"open question\" (p. 40). According to Habermas, the \"platform\" (p. 44) character is what is \"actually new about the new media\" (p. 44). In other words, they enable all potential users to participate in the public sphere as independent authors with equal rights. Political communication no longer depends on traditional journalists or any other expert or institution for professional selection and discursive examination. But the services produced by new, privately owned social media platforms are \"in no way neutral services\" (p. 53). They are driven by the capitalist logic of profit-making that also puts pressure on the \"old media\" to adjust to the new format. According to Habermas, the emancipatory potential of the digital public sphere today is \"\u00fcbert\u00f6nt\" (p. 45, in the sense of dominated) by \"fragmented publics\" (p. 45), \"bubbles\" (p. 62), and \"echo chambers\" (p. 45). Both the basic standards for a rational debate and the inclusiveness of the public sphere are threatened to be lost. The stakes are high: the political integration of modern democracies is at risk. It looks like a reminder of the final paragraphs of his first book on the public sphere and to his Encyclopedia article from the 1960s, when Habermas presents a strategy that includes three proposals to overcome this (newly) alarming decline of the public sphere. The first strategy counts on civic education: Citizens have to learn how to deal with this new technology in a reasonable way; and this may take some time (cf., pp. 46\u201347). The second strategy consists of strong state regulation of the mass media, for example, to force private owners of platforms in an effective way to correct false information or to prevent hate speech. Finally, the third reform strategy is to provide alternatives to the media power of privately owned companies. He proposes an expansion of financial support for state-funded and democratically controlled TV and radio stations (cf., p. 51 and 67), and even for (printed and digital) newspapers that fulfill certain quality standards (cf., p. 67).4 This reform agenda is conservative in that it attempts to carry the media organization of the 1970s into our digital age. In his 1962 book, he glorified the bourgeois public sphere. In his new book, he is again glorifying a media system of the past. I have listed his threefold political reform agenda because it provokes a non-trivial question: How is it possible to regulate the structures of political communication in a way that strengthens enlightened discussions via legislative measures, when such regulations (at least in democracies) have to be the result of (less enlightened) political communication? In the context of this question, it is striking that face-to-face communication gains more relevance in Habermas' theory than before. It is a subtle change. But it has the potential to produce more than just subtle changes to Habermas' final evaluation of the prospects for political reform of the public sphere. In his characterization of elected parliaments Habermas notes that their members \"deliberate and decide together [emphasis in original] according to democratic procedures\" (p. 24). I will not discuss the problematic theory of parliamentarism in the context of this article, but I do want to point to his formulation \"deliberate together [emphasis in original].\" In my understanding, this formulation indicates a normative preference for political communication in social face-to-face constellations, which is typical for interaction in the lifeworld. In a different section of the book, Habermas explicitly praises the deliberative quality of parliamentary decision-making because decisions are made \"face-to-face after democratic deliberations [emphasis in original]\" (p. 102). He also attests to the courts \"comparatively high level of rationality\" (p. 78), which seems not only to be the result of its legal institutionalization but also due to the fact that court hearings and deliberations are held face-to-face. Finally, in his characterization of social movements and a vibrant civil society he emphasizes their \"face-to-face encounters\" (p. 39) in everyday life and public events. In one of the most intriguing sections of the book, Habermas speculates about a changing perception by the users of social media in which the separation between public and private communication is abolished. According to him, a significant part of digital communication today should be understood neither as public nor as private. Rather it is a sphere of communication, which has been reserved until then for private correspondences by letter, that has been bloated to a public existence. It produces a \"peculiar anonymous intimacy\" (p. 62) which Habermas coins a \"Halb\u00f6ffentlichkeit\" (p. 65\u2014semi-public sphere) of echo chambers and filter bubbles.5 However, this speculation puts Habermas in a dilemma. The lifeworld in Habermas' theory is conceptualized as a linguistically organized and culturally transmitted stock of interpretative patterns which form the symbolic core of a society. He introduces the lifeworld as a necessary correlation to the notion of communicative action (see Baynes, 2016, pp. 64\u201370). The dilemma is the following one: On the one hand, Habermas continues to base the considerations in the book on the assumption of the rational potential of the lifeworld, in particular of face-to-face communication even in different social settings. On the other hand, his speculation provides the plausible assumption that under the conditions of the current digital communication infrastructure, there will be a massive unlearning of cognitive and moral In his 1962 book, Habermas that with the of mass media, the of the capitalist and the of the (Habermas, p.

      "abstract": "Abstract \"Public sphre\" is often used by historians of modern Latin America without much concern about its theoretical and methodological implications. Some historians have used it as a model to fit evidence about public debates and politics during the modern period, yet few have engaged it as a theory with deeper methodological and conceptual implications. This article will review the historical literature that has applied Habermas's ideas to Latin American history. Focusing on a few particularly important books, the article will examine potential avenues for research and comparisons. Rather than becoming a new orthodoxy for the study of the region, the theory of the public sphere is establishing a dialogue among historians interested in intellectual phenomena and political discourse (most of them centered on the history of liberalism after independence) and those historians whose interest in social formations have framed their study in terms of hegemony and class domination. The article will argue that a critical use of Habermas's ideas (one that is more systematic about the gender and class exclusions built into the bourgeois public sphere, and that problematizes the connections between the specific development of capitalism in peripheral regions and their embrace of European political traditions) could yield useful results in terms of new research and an inclusive synthesis of recent literature interested in politics, culture and hegemony in Latin America. Notes 1J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (Cambridge, MA, 1991). I am indebted to Tom Klubock, Thom Rath, Federico Sor and Mary Kay Vaughan for their comments on earlier drafts. This article was also discussed at the Columbia University's Department of History graduate faculty workshop and at the New School's workshop of Latin American Studies. I thank Karl Wennerlind, Herbert Sloan, Claudio Lomnitz and Paul Gootenberg for their comments. 2The danger, of course, is that of creating 'un Mapa del Imperio, que ten\u00eda el tama\u00f1o del imperio y coincid\u00eda puntualmente con \u00e9l'. 'El rigor de la ciencia' in Jorge Luis Borges, Obras completas II 1952\u20131972 (Barcelona, 1996). This map will have Mexico as the centre. It is a result of my background and I hope it can be excused as a geographical convention. 3See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures.

See J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Discourse ethics: notes on a program of philosophical justification' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (Cambridge, 1990). For the normative implications of the public-sphere model, see Nancy Fraser, 'Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy', Social Text, nos 25/26 (1990). See also Thomas A. McCarthy, The Critical Theory of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, first MIT Press paperback edition (Cambridge, 1981), chap. 1; J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Ciencia y t\u00e9cnica como 'ideolog\u00eda' (Mexico City, 1993). Implicit in Habermas's idea of 'communicative rationality' is 'the central experience of the unconstrained, unifying, consensus-bringing force of argumentative speech': J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, vol. 1, Reason and the Rationalization of Society, trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston, 1984), 10. 5Arthur Strum, 'A bibliography on the concept of \u00d6ffentlichkeit', New German Critique, lxi (1994). Habermas refers to 'seminal theories', like those by Freud and Marx, that 'inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research' resulting in 'hybrid discourses' that may be criticized from the academic establishment but could generate 'new research traditions'. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Philosophy as stand-in and interpreter' in Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, op. cit., 15. 6The OED provides two examples of the term, both dated 1992. See entries for 'maternalize' and 'nonsensification', Oxford English Dictionary (available online at: http://www.oed.com/). For the parallel with Weber see Joan B. Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution (Ithaca, 1988), 10. 7Habermas links the public sphere with his theory of communicative action at a 'fundamental' level: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'Further reflections on the public sphere', Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, 1997), 422, 41. Other scholars, mentioned below, have already suggested the need to confront analyses based on Gramsci and Habermas. 8Habermas's initial definition is tentative and contains the diversity of issues outlined above: 'The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labour. The medium of this political confrontation was peculiar and without historical precedent: people's public use of their reason.' See Habermas, Structural Transformation, op. cit., 27. See also J\u00fcrgen Habermas, 'The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article', New German Critique, iii (1974). On the historical character of the definition, see Moishe Postone, 'Political theory and historical analysis' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit. 9James Van Horn Melton, The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe (New York, 2001), 10, 12. 10For similar agendas see E.

A similar census would probably be impossible today. See also Peter Uwe Hohendahl, 'The public sphere: models and boundaries' in Calhoun (ed.), Habermas and the Public Sphere, op. cit., 108.

After independence, 'Lo radicalmente nuevo es la creaci\u00f3n de una escena p\u00fablica': Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 13, 23, 87. This parallels Benedict Anderson's claim that 'the convergence of capitalism and print technology \u2026 created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology set the stage for the modern nation', and his focus on American Creole identities as early examples of this process. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (New York and London, 1983), 46. Concepts like el pueblo or lo p\u00fablico also had a history that illustrated the incorporation of traditional and modern notions, as explored by Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 'Reflexiones sobre la terminolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica del liberalismo' in Carlos Illades, Brian Connaughton and Sonia P\u00e9rez Toledo (eds), Construcci\u00f3n de la legitimidad pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico (Zamora, 1999). 20Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 30. See Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Penser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise (Paris, 1978). For Palti, Guerra's use of Habermas lacked a 'strong' critique of the public-sphere model and failed to recognize Raymond Kosseleck's work as a necessary antecedent. Furet and Cochin were decisive in Guerra's work to strengthen that critique, without embracing 'las teor\u00edas multiculturalistas \"posmodernas\"'. El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 Palti, 'Guerra y Habermas: ilusiones y realidad de la esfera p\u00fablica Latinoamericana' in Erika Pani and Alicia Salmer\u00f3n (eds), Conceptualizar lo que se ve: Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Guerra historiador, homenaje (Mexico City, 2004), 466. 21See Dena Goodman, 'Public sphere and private life: toward a synthesis of current historiographical approaches to the Old Regime', History and Theory, xxxi, 1 (1992), 8, 12. Guerra's explicit rejection of Habermas's Marxism in Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 86n, 87, 14. For studies inspired by Guerra's insights and a closer connection to local contexts, see Francois-Xavier Guerra and Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (eds), Los espacios p\u00fablicos en Iberoam\u00e9rica: Ambig\u00fcedades y problemas: Siglos XVIII\u2013XIX (Mexico, 1999). For the public sphere as part of the politicization of new national societies, see Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez Bernaldo, 'Sociabilidad, espacio urbano y politizaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Buenos Aires (1820\u20131852)' in Hilda Sabato and Alberto Rodolfo Lettieri (eds), La vida pol\u00edtica en la Argentina del siglo XIX: armas, votos y voces (Buenos Aires, 2003), 199. 22Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 12, 101. Such characterization of the socio-economic impact and causes of the revolutions of independence is challenged in John Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750\u20131940 (Princeton, 1988); Eric Van Young, The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology, and the Mexican Struggle for Independence, 1810\u20131821 (Stanford, 2001). 23Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 17, 91, 234. The Habermasian focus on 'a new, autonomous, free, and sovereign public' implies a marked alternative from Furet's Tocquevillian emphasis on associations and modes of sociability as the base for a modern public opinion. Chartier, Cultural Origins, op. cit., 16\u201317. 24Guerra, Modernidad e independencias, op. cit., 52, 99. Guerra's emphasis on culture fits well with older visions of 'Latin American culture' as something clearly identifiable; for Edmundo O'Gorman, this common identity meant that the influence of the United States is negligible in the emergence of a Latin American political culture. Edmundo O'Gorman, 'Hegel y el moderno panamericanismo', Letras de M\u00e9xico, ii, 8 (1939). See Charles Hale, 'Edmundo O'Gorman y la historia nacional', Signos Hist\u00f3ricos, ii, 3 (2000), 17, 24. Absent is a problematization of neo-colonialism as an informal and subordinate mode of entering modernity. See Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi, The Contemporary History of Latin America, trans. John Charles Chasteen (Durham, NC, 1993). 25McEvoy, La utop\u00eda republicana, op. cit., 11. 26McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit.

If in the end the new nations rejected liberal monarchism, explains Rojas, it was because of the revolutionary logic of insurgency and the consequent loyalist response, but not because of any inherently democratic feature of the new public sphere.

See McEvoy, 'Ser\u00edamos excelentes vasallos', op. cit., 43. 31For the 'tradici\u00f3n republicana' as the centre of a long-term political history of Mexico that stresses local and corporative representation over democracy and equality, see Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez Ch\u00e1vez, La tradici\u00f3n republicana del buen gobierno (Mexico, 1993); Antonio Annino, 'Ciudadan\u00eda versus gobernabilidad republicana en M\u00e9xico: Los or\u00edgenes de un dilema' in Hilda S\u00e1bato (ed.), Ciudadan\u00eda pol\u00edtica y formaci\u00f3n de las naciones: Perspectivas hist\u00f3ricas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Mexico City, 1999).

      "abstract": "Abstract Critical social theories look critically at the ways in which particular social arrangements hinder human flourishing, with a view to bringing about social change for the better. In this they are guided by the idea of a good society in which the identified social impediments to human flourishing would once and for all have been removed. The question of how these guiding ideas of the good life can be justified as valid across socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs is the most fundamental difficulty facing critical social theories today. This problem of justification, which can be traced back to certain key shifts in the modern Western social imaginary, calls on contemporary theories to negotiate the tensions between the idea of context\u2010transcendent validity and their own anti\u2010authoritarian impulses. Habermas makes an important contribution towards resolving the problem, but takes a number of wrong turnings. Keywords: Critical theorynon\u2010authoritarian theoryautonomyHabermasformal pragmaticsHabermas's theory of justice Notes 1 In situating critical social theory within the modern Western social imaginary, I do not wish to imply that this form of modernity is in any sense superior to other forms. I follow S. N. Eisenstadt in confining myself to the thesis that it is distinctive; I also follow Eisenstadt in recognizing 'the great variability of the symbolic, ideological and institutional responses to it [Western modernity], of the ways in which different civilizations and societies interpret different symbolic premises of modernity and different modern institutional patterns and dynamics'. S. N. Eisenstadt, 'Introduction', in S. N. Eisenstadt (ed.) Patterns of Modernity, Vol. 1: The West (London: Frances Pinter, 1987), pp. 1\u201311, here, p. 5. 2 Here I am guided by Cornelius Castoriadis's view that every society creates a social imaginary that determines society's values and the institutions that embody them. However, I use the term in a general way without committing myself to other aspects of Castoriadis's account of the social imaginary. See C. Castoriadis, The Imaginary Institution of Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987). My use of the term is closer to that of Charles Taylor. See C. Taylor, Modern Social Imaginaries (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2004). 3 A well\u2010known example here is Nietzsche, who challenged key elements of the modern world\u2010view, for example, the assumptions that human beings are equal and that historical time is progressive, and took on the task of reorienting our perceptions with regard to these. See F. Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans. T. Common (London: Allen and Unwin, 1967) and F. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, trans. R. J. Hollingdale (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1973). 4 R. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). 5 This is Robert Brandom's gloss on Rorty's utopian idea of unfettered imaginative activity in his 'Vocabularies of Pragmatism: Synthesizing Naturalism and Historicism', in R. Brandom (ed.) Rorty and his Critics (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), p. 179. Rorty claims to be in enthusiastic agreement with the sections of Brandom's essays from which this quotation is taken in his 'Response to Robert Brandom', in Rorty and his Critics, pp. 184 and 189. 6 See Butler's contributions to J. Butler, E. Laclau and S. \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality (London: Verso, 2000). 7 J. Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols. 1 and 2, trans. T. McCarthy (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1984 and 1987). 8 Examples here are A. Honneth, Struggle for Recognition, trans. J. Anderson (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995), J. Habermas, 'Individuation through Socialization: On George Herbert Mead's Theory of Subjectivity', in his Postmetaphysical Thinking, trans. W. M. Hohengarten (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992), pp. 149\u2013204, and J. Habermas, 'Morality and Ethical Life: Does Hegel's Critique of Kant Apply to Discourse Ethics?', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, trans. C. Lenhardt and S. Weber Nicholsen (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), pp. 195\u2013215. 9 M. Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006). For an earlier effort in the same direction, see M. Cooke, 'A Space of One's Own: Autonomy, Privacy, Liberty', Philosophy and Social Criticism, 25 (1) (1999), pp. 23\u201353. 10 More precisely, the 'us' refers to 'us educated, sophisticated, tolerant, wet liberals, the people who are always willing to hear the other side, to think out all the implications, etc.' R. Rorty, 'Putnam and the Relativist Menace', Journal of Philosophy, 90 (9) (1993), 443\u201361, here, pp. 451\u20132. 11 For Butler, the normative and optimistic aspect of critical social thinking consists 'in the possibilities for expanding the key terms of liberalism, rendering them more inclusive, more dynamic and more concrete'. See J. Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', in Butler, Laclau and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 11\u201343, here, p. 13. Butler actually refers to 'the normative and optimistic moment' of hegemony; however, her formulation seems equally applicable to critical social thinking as she conceives it. 12 'Dogmatic' is used in the 'harmless sense' that for us, who have developed our identities within the socio\u2010cultural context of Western modernity, it cannot be circumvented. J. Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, trans. W. Rehg (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), pp. 445\u201356. 13 See J. Butler, 'Gender Trouble, Feminist Theory, and Psychoanalytic Discourse', in L. Nicholson (ed.) Feminism/Postmodernism (New York: Routledge, 1990), p. 324\u201340. In her most recent writings, however, there is some evidence that Butler is now less hostile to the notions of subjectivity with which the idea of autonomy is linked and may even be prepared to view autonomy as one of the key terms of liberal modernity that are open to creative rearticulation and re\u2010enactment. See J. Butler, Antigone's Claim: Kinship between Life and Death (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000) and J. Butler, Undoing Gender (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). 14 I outline the concept of autonomy that in my view best takes account of this intuition in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 15 Ferrara posits coherence and depth as two of the four normative requirements of authentic identity: A. Ferrara, Reflective Authenticity (London: Routledge, 1998). 16 Butler is likely to reject the very terms in which this disagreement is cast. Nor is it clear on which side of the divide she would position herself, even if she were to accept its terms. In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, I argue, nonetheless, that this is an issue of central concern to her theory and that a context\u2010transcending position would make best sense of her idea of universality as radical translation (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). 17 For Butler, all forms of identity \u2013 for example, the identity of individual subjects \u2013 are constituted differentially. That is, their constitution produces a constitutive outside that can never become fully inside or immanent. On the 'incompletion' of what she calls the subject position, see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal', p. 12. 18 Butler, 'Dynamic Conclusions', in Butler, Laclan and \u017di\u017eek, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pp. 263\u2013280, here, p. 268. 19 Habermas, who defends a context\u2010transcending position, accuses radically contextualist approaches such as Rorty's of collapsing the distinction between the strategic and non\u2010strategic uses of language. J. Habermas, 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn', in his On the Pragmatics of Communication, edited and with an introduction by M. Cooke (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), pp. 343\u201382. Rorty replies in his 'Response to Habermas', in Brandom, Rorty and his Critics, p. 58. 20 These objections to a radically contextualist critical approach are tailored to discursive \u2013 argumentation\u2010based \u2013 models of social criticism. However, as I point out in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 4, there are equivalent objections to non\u2010argumentative models of social criticism. 21 Other contemporary thinkers who explicitly endorse a context\u2010transcending approach include Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser. See their respective contributions in N. Fraser and A. Honneth, Redistribution or Recognition? A Political\u2010Philosophical Exchange (London: Verso, 2003). 22 The term Habermas uses to describe what I call the anti\u2010authoritarian impulse of contemporary critical social theory is 'post\u2010metaphysical'. See Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking. For a brief account of the postmetaphysical character of Habermas's idea of communicative rationality see M. Cooke, Language and Reason (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1994), pp. 38\u201343. As I point out below, Habermas's postmetaphysical approach goes beyond anti\u2010authoritarian approaches by leaving no room for the postulate of a transcendent \u2013 metaphysical \u2013 object. 23 Axel Honneth uses the term 'Left\u2010Hegelian' to describe the tradition of critical social thinking out of which the critical theory of the Frankfurt School emerges. The term has the advantage that it makes explicit the Frankfurt School's concern to rearticulate the critical social thinking of Hegel, as interpreted above all by Marx and Luk\u00e1cs. See A. Honneth, 'Eine Soziale Pathologie der Vernunft. Zur intellektuellen Erbschaft der Kritischen Theorie', in C. Halbig and M. Quante (eds), Sozialphilosophie zwischen Kritik und Anerkennung (M\u00fcnster, Hamburg, Berlin, Wien, London: LIT Verlag, 2003). 24 Cf. A. Honneth, 'The Social Dynamics of Disrespect: On the Location of Critical Theory Today', Constellations, 1 (2) (1994), pp. 255\u201369. 25 M. Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, The Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. J. Cumming (London: Allen Lane, 1973). 26 Evidently, it also gives rise to a problem of motivation since the authors eliminate the possibility of any kind of human reflection on, or conscious human resistance to, the oppressive, dehumanizing effects of twentieth\u2010century capitalism. 27 Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vols 1 and 2. 28 J. Habermas, 'What is Universal Pragmatics?', in Habermas, On the Pragmatics of Communication, pp. 21\u2013103. See also Cooke, Language and Reason. It should be noted that Habermas sees reconstructive theories as dependent on indirect validation by other theories. See J. Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 116\u201394, here, pp. 116\u201318. 29 Habermas's clearest statement of the role which formal pragmatics plays in justifying his theory of communicative action can be found his writings on discourse ethics. See J. Habermas, 'Discourse Ethics: Notes on A Program of Philosophical Justification', in his Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, pp. 42\u2013115 (esp. pp. 82\u201398). Here, the universalist character of his formal\u2010pragmatic hypotheses is evident, for example, when he states that 'the principle of universalization [\u2026] is implied by the presuppositions of argumentation in general' (p.86, my italics). To be sure, it is not clear how exactly this statement is to be understood. On occasion, he suggests that certain of the strong idealizations on which his theory depends are the result of socio\u2010cultural learning processes; these learning processes, which come about for historically contingent reasons, can be seen as developing the inherent logic of normative intuitions that are features of communication in all socio\u2010cultural contexts and historical epochs. However, this qualification merely increases his burden of proof, for he now has to show not only that the normative intuitions in question are a feature of communication in general but also that there is an inherent logic to their development along the reflexive and universalist lines he describes. In his writings of the 1970s and 1980s Habermas held the view that reconstructive theories of individual moral development of the kind proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg could help him in this regard, while acknowledging that the difficulties involved in developing any such theory on a socio\u2010cultural level were considerable (see J. Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society, trans. T. McCarthy (London: Heinemann, 1979) and Habermas, 'Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'). Since then, however, he has made no attempt to develop the required theory of socio\u2010cultural learning and has, moreover, expressed reservations about a number of fundamental aspects of Kohlberg's theory (see J. Habermas, 'A Philosophico\u2010Political Profile', in his Autonomy and Solidarity, ed. Peter Dews (London: Verso, 1986), pp. 149\u201389, here, p. 168 and J. Habermas, 'Lawrence Kohlberg and Neo\u2010Aristotelianism', in his Justification and Application: Remarks on Discourse Ethics, trans. C. Cronin (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993), pp. 113\u201332). For these reasons, I leave aside this complication in the following. 30 Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 29\u201338. To be sure, this constitutes an objection to his theory only in the absence of a theory of socio\u2010cultural learning that would show the idealizations in question to be the logical necessary development of normative intuitions that are features of communicative practices in general (see n. 29 above). 31 Seyla Benhabib makes this point with regard to the idealizing suppositions guiding moral argumentation in her Situating the Self (New York: Routledge, 1992), pp. 29\u201332. Cf. Cooke, Language and Reason, pp. 31\u20134. 32 See Cooke, Language and Reason, esp. pp. 150\u201362. 33 See Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, p. 109. Here he explicitly endorses the formal\u2010pragmatic justification of the moral principle of universalizability that he conducted in his earlier work. 34 In his writings subsequent to The Theory of Communicative Action there is some evidence that Habermas is prepared to accept that formal pragmatics provides only limited support for his concept of communicative rationality. Although he continues to affirm the importance of formal pragmatics as a justificatory strategy, on occasion he seems willing to admit that, on its own, formal pragmatics, cannot justify the emancipatory perspective offered by his critical social theory. See, for example, J. Habermas, 'A Genealogical Analysis of the Cognitive Content of Morality', in his The Inclusion of the Other, ed. C. Cronin and P. de Greiff (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000), pp. 3\u201346, here, p. 45. Furthermore, I discern evidence of an implicit acknowledgment of the limited justificatory power of formal pragmatics in Habermas's recent metatheoretical writings, in particular in the 'weak' naturalist argument he outlines in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1999), pp. 27\u201340. This argument aims to shed light on the question of how we can uphold a conception of objectivity notwithstanding the multiplicity and contingency of world\u2010generating grammars. In the course of the argument Habermas acknowledges his theory's reliance on the assumption that human beings unavoidably conceive of the progress of history as the possibility of learning. I regard this acknowledgment as a definite step in the right direction. See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'Socio\u2010Cultural Learning as a \"Transcendental\" Fact: Habermas's Postmetaphysical Perspective', International Journal of Philosophical Studies, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 63\u201383 and M. Cooke, 'Between \"Objectivism\" and \"Contextualism\": the Normative Foundations of Social Philosophy', Critical Horizons, 1 (2) (2000), pp. 193\u2013227. 35 See especially Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, Chs 7 and 8. 36 See my discussion in M. Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism: Habermas's Conception of Justice', European Journal of Political Theory, 2 (3) (2003), pp. 298\u2013300. 37 J. Rawls, Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993). It is noteworthy that Habermas criticizes (what I call) the radically contextualist aspect of Rawls's theory. See J. Habermas, 'Reconciliation through the Public Use of Reason: Remarks on John Rawls's Political Liberalism', Journal of Philosophy, 92 (3) (1995), pp. 109\u201331. Reprinted in Habermas, The Inclusion of the Other, pp. 49\u201373. 38 See nn 30 and 29 above. 39 Benhabib makes a similar point in her Situating the Self, p. 32. Indeed, the justificatory strategy I propose is similar to Benhabib's in a number of respects. The differences between our positions have to do with my proposed conceptualization of the idea of context\u2010transcending validity that is operative in argumentation. In M. Cooke, 'Habermas and Consensus', European Journal of Philosophy, 1 (3) (1993), pp. 247\u201367, I argue that this aspect of Benhabib's theory is underdeveloped. In Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 7, I make some concrete suggestions as to how it should be developed. 40 I develop it further in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 6. 41 I develop it further ibid., Chs 1 and 2. 42 I discuss his theory of truth in some detail in M. Cooke, 'Habermas on Meaning and Truth', European Journal of Philosophy, 9 (1) (2001), pp. 1\u201323, in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism' and in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 5. 43 Habermas, Postmetaphysical Thinking, p. 8. 44 Ibid., p. 139. 45 It has been criticized, for example, for its restriction of moral discourse to discussion from the standpoint of the 'generalized other', neglecting the standpoint of the 'concrete other' (in Benhabib, Situating the Self, pp. 340\u20132); for its proposal that the idea of an agreement reached in an idealized process of moral discourse can be used as a standard for testing the validity of actual moral norms and principles (in A. Wellmer, 'Ethics and Dialogue', in his The Persistence of Modernity, trans. D. Midgley (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 1991), pp. 113\u2013231 and in C. Lafont, 'Realismus und Konstruktivismus in der kantianischen Moralphilosophie \u2013 das Beispiel der Diskursethik', Deutsche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Philosophie, 50 (1) (2002), pp. 39\u201352); and for making moral insight dependent on the exchange of arguments in moral discourse (in Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', pp. 294\u20138). 46 Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Chs 5, 6 and 7. 47 See J. Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 271\u2013317, esp. 296\u2013301. 48 See Habermas, 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit'. 49 J. Habermas, 'Einf\u00fchrung: Realismus nach der pragmatischen Wende', in his Wahrheit und Rechtfertigung, pp. 7\u201364, here, pp. 56\u201357; see also 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit', esp. pp. 293\u20135. The German word normally used by Habermas is unverf\u00fcgbar. 50 The main elements of Habermas's revised theory of truth are set out in his 'Richtigkeit versus Wahrheit' and in his 'Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Turn'. 51 Judith Butler gives examples of ways in which the concept of universality has been vigorously contested, resulting in creative new articulations and restagings of it (see Butler, 'Restaging the Universal'). Similarly, the concept of autonomy has been the subject of vigorous contestation and rearticulation. Even the concept of contestability can be the object of socio\u2010cultural learning: Albrecht Wellmer, for example, suggests that the question of which 'truths' can be contested is itself a contested matter, suggesting the need to reconsider the concept of contestability itself (see A. Wellmer, Sprachphilosophie (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2004), pp. 250\u201377). 52 See Cooke, 'The Weaknesses of Strong Intersubjectivism', and Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, esp. Ch. 7. 53 K. Marx, 'Theses on Feuerbach', in D. McLellan (ed.) Karl Marx: Selected Writings (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 156\u20138. 54 However, in Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I argue that a non\u2010authoritarian conception of theory calls on critical social theory to rearticulate the traditional Marxian notion of praxis. 55 In Cooke, Re\u2010Presenting the Good Society, Ch. 8, I suggest that contemporary critical social theories are well advised to give up the aspiration of providing a 'grand explanation' of what is wrong with the existing social order and to concentrate, instead, on analysing how the impediments to human flourishing are reproduced and disseminated.",

Locating securitization theory within the context of both classical Realism influenced by Carl Schmitt, and current work on constructivist ethics, it argues that while the Copenhagen School is largely immune from the most common criticisms leveled against it, the increasing impact of televisual communication in security relations provides a fundamental challenge for understanding the processes and institutions involved in securitization, and for the political ethics advocated by the Copenhagen School.",

      "abstract": "Despite increasing academic attention paid to dark tourism, understanding of the concept remains limited, particularly from a consumption perspective. That is, the literature focuses primarily on the supply of dark tourism; less attention, however, has been paid to the demand for \u2018dark\u2019 touristic experiences. This theoretical paper seeks to address this gap in the literature. Drawing upon the contemporary sociology of death, it explores the relationship between socio-cultural perspectives on mortality and the potential of dark tourism as a means of confronting death in modern societies. In so doing, it proposes a model of dark tourism consumption within a thanatological framework as a basis for further theoretical and empirical analysis of dark tourism.",

After reviewing existing discussions of mediatization by Krotz (2007), Schulz (2004), Thompson (1995), and others, an institutional approach to the mediatization process is suggested. Mediatization is to be considered a double-sided process of high modernity in which the media on the one hand emerge as an independent institution with a logic of its own that other social institutions have to accommodate to. On the other hand, media simultaneously become an integrated part of other institutions like politics, work, family, and religion as more and more of these institutional activities are performed through both interactive and mass media. The logic of the media refers to the institutional and technological modus operandi of the media, including the ways in which media distribute material and symbolic resources and make use of formal and informal rules.",

Kelty investigates the history and cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and practices that have transformed not only software but also music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software source code that is made openly and freely available through an unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by demonstrating how Free Software is a \"recursive public\" - a public organized around the ability to build, modify, and maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first place.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: We discuss the role that transnational corporations (TNCs) should play in developing global governance, creating a framework of rules and regulations for the global economy. The central issue is whether TNCs should provide global rules and guarantee individual citizenship rights, or instead focus on maximizing profits. First, we describe the problems arising from the globalization process that affect the relationship between public rules and private firms. Next we consider the position of economic and management theories in relation to the social responsibility of the firm. We argue that instrumental stakeholder theory and business and society research can only partially solve the global governance issue, and that more recent concepts of corporate citizenship and republican business ethics deliver theoretically and practically helpful, fresh insights. However, even these need further development, especially with regard to the legitimacy of corporate political activity.",

      "abstract": "She referred to the high-rise as if it were some kind of huge animate presence, brooding over them and keeping a magisterial eye on the events taking place. There was something in this feeling \u2014 the elevators pumping up and down the long shafts resembled pistons in the chamber of a heart. The residents moving along the corridors were the cells in a network of arteries, the lights in their apartments the neurones of a brain (J.G. Ballard, 1975: 40). Now, the boundaries between the organic and the inorganic, blurred by cybernetic and bio-technologies, seem less sharp; the body, itself invaded and re-shaped by technology, invades and permeates the space outside, even as this space takes on dimensions that themselves confuse the inner and the outer, visually, mentally and physically (Anthony Vidler, 1990: 37\u20138). The body-territory [corpo-territorio] poses a problematic form of corporeal identity that in becoming ever more routinized has tended to dissolve the distinctions that formerly existed between the organic and the inorganic (Tiziana Villani, 1995: 118). As she tentatively begins to play the piano, the replicant, named Rachel, recalls that she once had lessons but cannot be sure whether these memories are her own or simply the implanted memories of someone else. In this poignant scene in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) we explore the possibility that human identities might be artificially created in order to produce advanced androids whose intelligence and sensitivity is comparable with that of their human creators. The figure of the cyborg, as represented in science fiction cinema, is not an automaton or robot but a sophisticated creation that seems to simultaneously extend but also threaten our understanding of what it means to be human. If we were to locate the cyborg as an idea, we could say that it is clearly linked to fantastical combinations of bodies and machines but is nonetheless a way of thinking about the world. It is, in other words, an ontological strategy for extending the limits to human knowledge as well as an apposite means of describing those phenomena that appear to reside outside conventional frameworks of understanding. If a cyborgian sensibility is explored within the context of the contemporary city, we find that it has developed out of several interconnecting strands of thought as a trope of critical reflection which uncovers a series of anomalies, fractures and tensions lurking within dominant modes of urban and architectural thinking. Since the early 1960s the potential applications of the cyborg concept have proliferated to include developments such as whole organism cloning, in vitro fertilization, gene sequencing, advanced prosthetics and other sophisticated medical technologies. In tandem with these technological manifestations, the imaginative field of the cyborg has expanded through literature, cinema and the fantasy spaces of contemporary culture.1 It is since the mid-1980s, however, that the idea of the cyborg has been associated with a more densely argued series of theoretical applications as a means to explore the interface between technology and the body. The key intervention here is Donna Haraway's article entitled 'A Cyborg Manifesto', first published in the Socialist Review in 1985, and later included in her influential collection of essays Simians, Cyborgs and Women where she writes in her introduction (1991a: 1): A cyborg is a hybrid creature, composed of organism and machine. But, cyborgs are compounded of special kinds of machines and special kinds of organisms appropriate to the late twentieth century. Cyborgs are post-Second World War hybrid entities made of, first, ourselves and other organic creatures in our unchosen \"high-technological\" guise as information systems, texts, and ergonomically controlled labouring, desiring, and reproducing systems. The second essential ingredient in cyborgs is machines in their guise, also, as communications systems, texts, and self-acting, ergonomically designed apparatuses. This succinct and revealing definition reminds us that the idea of the cyborg, as originally elaborated by Haraway, is at root a political as well as an intellectual project, an idea which originated in and from the 'belly of the monster' (1991a: 4), that nexus of political and economic entanglements that we might term the 'first world' in distinction to the proliferating spaces of marginality that lie beyond.2 Since its inception as a critical intellectual concept in the 1980s the cyborg metaphor has been deployed to challenge disembodied, dualistic, masculinist and teleological bodies of knowledge. It has infused science and technology studies with feminist epistemological strategies. It has opened up new possibilities for the understanding of relations between nature and culture. And it has facilitated greater sensitivity towards social and spatial complexity through its emphasis on 'situated knowledges'. The idea of the cyborg shares an affinity with related concepts such as 'cyberspace', 'cybernetics' and 'cyberpunk'. Yet the contemporary use of the term 'cyborg' is different from these virtual, analytical and fictional constructs because it is grounded in the living and breathing flesh of the human body. Whilst the 'cyber-' metaphor has tended to be associated with various forms of virtuality, the idea of the cyborg is closely linked with the corporeal experience of space.3 In this sense the cyborg can be read as an alternative way of conceptualizing the growth and development of cities that serves to destabilize the pervasive narratives of dematerialization, spatial malleability and virtualization. The underlying materiality of the cyborg metaphor has acquired heightened significance now that the earlier polarity between virtual space and 'meat space' articulated in the first wave of cyber literature is losing its conceptual utility and now that the very idea of 'virtual reality' is itself imploding as it becomes either relocated in the context of a heightened dimension of the real (see, for example, \u017di\u017eek, 2002) or simply derided as an inherently oxymoronic formulation (see Grosz, 2001).4 The emphasis of the cyborg on the material interface between the body and the city is perhaps most strikingly manifested in the physical infrastructure that links the human body to vast technological networks. If we understand the cyborg to be a cybernetic creation, a hybrid of machine and organism, then urban infrastructures can be conceptualized as a series of interconnecting life-support systems (see Swyngedouw, 1996; Marras, 1999; Gandy, 2002; Mitchell, 2003). The modern home, for example, has become a complex exoskeleton for the human body with its provision of water, warmth, light and other essential needs. The home can be conceived as 'prosthesis and prophylactic' in which modernist distinctions between nature and culture, and between the organic and the inorganic, become blurred (Vidler, 1990: 37). And beyond the boundaries of the home itself we find a vast interlinked system of networks, pipes and wires that enable the modern city to function. These interstitial spaces of connectivity within individual buildings extend through urban space to produce a multi-layered structure of extraordinary complexity and utility. The figure of the cyborg is at root a spatial metaphor. But how does the idea of the cyborg intersect with spatial theory? In what ways does the cyborg reinforce or contradict other emerging strands of urban thought that also emphasize urban complexity and hybridity? Has the epistemological subtlety and political prescience of the cyborg, as originally formulated in the 1980s, been realized in practice or simply been diffused through the term's widening usage? And should we ultimately reject the idea of the cyborg as an anachronism derived from cold war science and the first generation of twentieth-century cyberpunk culture? In the rest of this article I will try to address these issues through an exploration of the somewhat haphazard presence of the cyborg in contemporary urban discourse. I will focus in particular on the example of urban infrastructure as a concrete manifestation of the cyborg idea in order to explore different facets of the relationship between the city, the body and the human subject. My aim is not to foreclose discussions surrounding the 'cyborg city' but to open up a series of dialogues in order to explore contemporary thinking around these questions. One of the principal difficulties with delineating the cyborg city as a clearly defined entity is derived from the entanglement of the cyborg idea with a variety of urban metaphors ranging from organicist conceptions of the nineteenth-century city to 'neo-organicist' representations of the post-industrial metropolis. In its classic nineteenth-century form the organicist conception of the city emerged out of a functional analogy, originating within the medical sciences, wherein spatial differentiation corresponded with a distinctive arrangement of human organs. We find that Kantian notions of the self-organizational characteristics of animate matter were combined with new insights into the human vascular and arterial system and an emerging circulatory emphasis within the nascent science of political economy. In recent years, however, the organicist emphasis on the city as an integrated body with identifiable organs, which emerged in response to the nineteenth-century industrial city, has been increasingly displaced by the idea of urban space as a prosthetic extension to the human body. The body-city problematic has been reconceptualized in the context of post-Cartesian and post-positivist modes of thinking. The emphasis on the city as a self-contained body or machine has been challenged by a hybridized conception of space as a system of technological devices that enhances human productive and imaginative capabilities. The cyborg metaphor not only reworks the metabolic preoccupations of the nineteenth-century industrial city but also extends to a contemporary body of ideas that we can term 'neo-organicist' on account of the deployment of biophysical metaphors for the interpretation of social and spatial complexity. In the neo-organicist city we encounter a shift of emphasis away from an anatomical conception of space as an assemblage of individual organs towards a neurological reading of space as a diffuse and interconnected realm of human interaction. The film maker Michael Burke, for example, director of Cyborg City (1999), describes how beneath the 'glass and concrete' of the future city there will be a 'humming mass of technology' acting as a central nervous system, 'constantly monitoring and controlling both its own functions and those of its citizens' (Burke, 1998).5 The mechanical and hierarchical model of the relationship between the body and the city has been supplanted by a more complex and non-linear pattern of urban development in response to the spread of new information technologies (see Gille, 1986; Rabinbach, 1990; Akira, 2001). The organicist city of the modern era was founded on a clear separation between mind and body that enabled the city to be conceptualized as a coherent entity to be acted upon, disciplined, regulated and shaped according to human will. The emergence of the neo-organicist city, in contrast, is founded on the blurring of boundaries rather than their repeated delineation. At the same time, however, there remain important continuities between the kind of machine-based metaphors associated with the early twentieth-century futurism of figures such as Mario Chiattone, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Antoniono Sant'Elia and the elaborate computer-based metaphors deployed in the contemporary city (see Villani, 1995; Boyer, 1996; Schaub, 1998). Other significant continuities include, for example, the avant-garde bricolage of early cinema and the surrealist bodies depicted in the art of Hans Bellmer, Francis Picabia and other responses to 'a sterile and over rationalised technological realism' (Vidler, 1990: 42).6 These interconnecting strands between cultural modernism and the emergence of the cyborg metaphor are significant because they underlie the centrality of corporeal metaphors for the critical interpretation of urban form. The current emphasis on corporeal and neurological analogies in the neo-organicist literature owes more to earlier developments than is widely acknowledged. We can detect two principal dimensions to contemporary neo-organicist urban thought. A first strand, rooted in the bio-physical sciences, perceives the city to be a special kind of complex, yet intricately ordered system. This homeostatic perspective, which is inflected by ecological thinking and recent developments in evolutionary biology, has diffused through parts of the architectural literature and is only tangentially linked with the epistemological challenge of cyborg theory.7 A second and more intellectually significant development is represented by the convergence of ideas surrounding the 'thinking space' of the city and the indeterminacy of spatial forms. If the body-city nexus is conceptualized as a thinking machine then the analytical focus shifts towards the identification of those critical networks or 'neurones' that sustain the relationship between the body and the city (Kurokawa, 2001a). Though this dimension to the neo-organicist perspective shares important continuities with the technological preoccupations of early twentieth-century modernism, it extends its conceptual purview into different aspects of cultural modernism. The influential speculations of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, for example, develop Antonin Artaud's conception of the 'body without organs' to produce a philosophy of spatial complexity quite different from that associated with dominant modernist traditions (Deleuze and Guattari, 1986; 1987; Rajchman, 2000; Uno, 2001). Their philosophical challenge is to perceive space in the absence of any previously existent categories, hierarchies or systems as a form of 'anarchic non-identical proliferation' (Luckhurst, 1997: 128). The organic metaphor of the 'rhizome' is deployed in distinction to 'arborescent' conceptions of cities as hierarchical structures (Teysott, 1990; Akira, 2001; Kurokawa, 2001a). In addition to this emphasis on non-hierarchical structures of difference Deleuze and Guattari's conception of concrete space also seeks to incorporate the imaginary, libidinous and oneiric realms of human experience. From their 'neo-vitalist' perspective, which builds on the philosophical ideas of Henri Bergson, the virtual realm is not simply a mimesis or reflection of physical reality but an independent domain that generates new kinds of spaces and ideas. The political significance of the virtual realm lies in its experimental and emergent role as part of an envisioned space that has yet to be realized within the taken-for-granted realm of concrete reality (Boundas, 1996; Massumi, 2001). The role of the diagram or 'abstract machine' takes on special significance in this context as an attempt to give visual expression to new models of reality.8 In the case of architecture, for example, there has been an intense dialogue between developments in building design and the speculative possibilities engendered by computer-aided simulations so that 'physical space increasingly resembles cyberspace' (Mitchell, 2003: 197). Some architectural practices have deployed so-called 'genetic algorithms' in order to generate a form of 'in vitro' architecture which derives its inspiration from nature yet remains autonomous from it as a purely digitized space of imaginative exploration (see Chu, 2002; De Landa, 2002).9 Examples of architectural practice inflected by post-structuralist ideas which move beyond purely 'in vitro' speculations to fully realized projects include the work of Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry and Bernard Tschumi, where sophisticated combinations of form, structure and materials have been achieved, which are quite at odds with modernist conceptions of architectural form. A conceptual synthesis can be discerned in some of the recent literature between post-structuralist philosophies of space and Latourian conceptions of actor-network theory to produce a new kind of urban theorization which eschews the meta-narratives associated with neo-Marxian approaches. Building on the insights of Deleuze and Guattari these approaches have sought to remove all the extrinsic or foundational aspects to urban theory and pare analysis down to the movements and interactions that constitute 'the city' as a particular kind of spatial form or activity that is independent of conventional accounts of scale, structure or order.10 The brain or 'thinking space' of the city persists yet is dispersed through innumerable nodes and networks in contrast with the embodied cyborg citizen to be found in the more technophile literature. We can trace these developments back to the emerging critique of architectural modernism in the 1970s and 1980s that increasingly drew on the theoretical ontologies of post-structuralism in order to advance a radically unplanned built form.11 From this perspective the role of 'chaos', for example, takes on a very different significance from that associated with the modernist city and is perceived as a field of evolutionary and radical experimentation. Chaos is no longer seen as an anomalous dimension to the urban experience to be problematized or excluded from analysis but a rich vein of social and spatial interaction through which we may perceive signs of alternative or hitherto overlooked urban forms. Chaos may also be characterized as a more sophisticated, resilient and adaptable form of order as Rem Koolhaas has suggested with respect to the dynamics of West African urbanism (Koolhaas et al., 2001; Koolhaas, 2002). The theoretical novelty of such a perspective sits sharply at odds, however, with the capacity for what one might term 'avant-garde urbanism' to actually explicate any substantial dimensions to urban change (see, for example, Rauterberg, 2002; Gandy, 2004b). We can detect within urban and architectural discourse an emerging counter current to post-structuralist and avant-garde urbanism led by a of and political (see 1996; and 1998). Though the post-structuralism of Deleuze and Guattari seeks to between the and the and is in this respect a significant advance on the and of there is a in any kind of political critique of the cyborg The emphasis on the characteristics of urban space the particular combinations of and human that enable nodes within the urban system to play in the of cultural and economic The of structure the of the theoretical and significance of these insights the between post-structuralism and a cyborg sensibility towards the entanglement of the real and the We are with an between the reading of the industrial city and a 'neo-organicist' with the design of space that quite in architectural The emerging of the interface as a technological is associated with nineteenth-century over science and technology, for example, form part of a counter discourse to modernist of technological 1996; 2003).

The value of history is presented in its interpretive power, in both investigating the particular through individual cases and how these are related to larger societal forces of change producing explanation, establishing causal relations, and achieving understanding as Verstehen in its full hermeneutic sense.

See Weber's opus magnum, Economy and Society (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1968) for the classic definition of bureaucratisation \u2013 compartmentalisation is inevitable the more an organisation becomes bureaucratic. 7. Even though it has become common practice in the English\u2010speaking world to use the terms 'leadership' and 'administration' synonymously in education to denote formal positions of authority, many still maintain a distinction between the two (as one can note in the titles in note 9). Following to some extent in the Weberian tradition, but also in the public administration tradition, this author recognises the distinction as follows: administrative roles are those that are formally structured and whose legitimacy and power are sanctioned through policy regimes that do not require acceptance of the person but the responsibilities of the office; leadership roles, on the other hand, are constructed in interpersonal relationships that are not necessarily formally sanctioned, whose legitimacy is conferred by followers on individuals for their personal qualities, and whose value is not bound by existing organisational or institutional purpose and policy regimes. In other words, administration is an organisationally constituted formal category, and leadership is a personally constructed political category. 8.

      "abstract": "Abstract In most approaches to measuring democracy, the underlying assumptions are highly a-historical and a-cultural. This article is a critique of such approaches and provides the outline for an alternative interpretation. It argues that different histories and cultures produce different democracies. Conventional measuring paradigms are insufficient to adequately measure progress towards democracy in postcolonial settings. The article offers four arguments as to why democracy in the postcolony will not, and cannot, develop in a similar fashion to those in the North American and Western European settings. It focuses on the different historical trajectories of state construction; the limits of the postcolonial state in terms of its domestic capacities; the positioning of emerging market economies and democracies in the global financial system; and, finally, the variety of cultural conceptions of the proper relationship between community and individual. These four factors ensure that postcolonial democracies will differ in their trajectories from those of their Western counterparts. The article concludes that it is high time to 'democratize democracy', so that postcolonial attempts at creating democratic systems are given equal weight in the debates concerning progress towards democratic regimes and that different trajectories and conceptions of the meaning of democracy are take into account in Western democratic discourse.

Robert Dahl, Polyarchy (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1971). Dahl outlines eight criteria which he thinks define an institutional democracy. These criteria include the freedom to form and join organizations, freedom of expression, voting, eligibility for office, competition for votes, alternative sources of information, fair and free elections, and accountable institutions. These eight criteria shape much of the political science debate concerning the definition of democracy and provide the basis for an entire industry of political analysis that concerns itself with measuring the 'quality of democracy'. See, for instance, Markus Crepaz and Vickie Birchfield, 'Global Economics, Local Politics', in Markus Crepaz, Thomas Koelble, and David Wilsford (eds), Democracy and Institutions (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2000), pp. 197\u2013224. 9. The term 'postcolony' in this article is used in its widest sense. We refer here to nations where processes were put into place that did not encourage the emergence of rights-bearing citizens but of subjects; where a state structure was put in place for the extraction of resources and surplus value for foreign rather than domestic benefit; where economic sovereignty was not established; and where notions of subjectivity developed that do not coincide with Western notions of individual rights and preferences. While these developments took place largely in colonial contexts (most of Africa and Latin America, and much of Asia), there are some states, nations, and spaces where such developments also took place without the establishment of a conventional colonial super-structure (e.g., Eastern Europe after 1945). For a discussion of the term see Achille Mbembe, On the Post-colony (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2001). 10. The term 'habitus' is borrowed from Pierre Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998) to suggest that the politics of democracy is a mutually constituting interaction of structures, dispositions, and practices. On this account, the politics of democratic governance is a result of the way institutions work (e.g., NGOs, judicial system) and of the embodied dispositions toward governance engendered by a people's historical experiences. Functionally, the structures of governance and embodied (and thus situated) knowledge of those structures shape enduring orientations to action which serve to reproduce those structures (which is why postcolonial governance often reproduces a colonial-like model). However, neither the structures of governance nor citizen's political practices and responses mechanistically follow from those orientations. They are also produced by a process of improvisation which is, in turn, defined by a nation's cultural orientations, the constraints it must overcome, the personal trajectories and capacities of its politicians, and the ability of its people to engage in politics 11. We employ the term inflected modernity to indicate that the varied paths taken by the postcolonial countries will be deeply and persistently influenced by EuroAmerican concepts of modernity, but will critically diverge from that EuroAmerican version according to their own specific histories. 12.

We seek a more nuanced position, which transcends the opposition between 'structure versus agency'. And for this reason we have adopted the notion of the habitus which assumes that agents employ schemes that are informed, but never determined, by their structural position and by their acts of position-taking within a field of action. The expression of agency in respect to these structuring forces is thus variable, and subject to the political labours of agents to gain more freedom. While political leaders such as Mandela certainly make a difference in establishing democratic benchmarks, at this historical juncture, the structural limits imposed on emerging democracies in emerging market societies are such that the attainment of Western democratic standards becomes difficult. This is precisely because the structures laid down by apartheid and the structure of the global economy today often place constraints on liberal democratic practices and attempts to realize its emancipatory goals. While it may be tempting to position Mandela as a champion of democracy and Mugabe as his opposite, it should be recalled that Mugabe was, for several years, the 'poster boy' of IMF reforms and seen as a model African leader by much of the Western press. The collapse of the Zimbabwean economy in its transition from autarchy to a globally open economy is at the heart of the current political debacle and less an example of poor agency as of blinding structural constraints on an agricultural economy that followed IMF prescriptions and paid a heavy price for that mistake. For an analysis of the development of the Zimbabwean crisis see Bond (note 44). 73. There are reports that, in the period February 2006 to May 2007, some 200,000 households have moved from townships to suburbs in the metropolitan areas of South Africa. These households are referred to as 'Black Diamonds' and constitute the core of the 'new black middle class'. The size of this new black middle class is the subject of much controversy with some observers claiming that it constitutes well over three million individuals and others arguing that it is much smaller. See Sunday Times Business Times (Johannesburg), 20 May 2007, p. 1. The point is that it has taken over a decade for such a class of individuals to emerge and for that class to move from township to suburb. 74.

Similarly, the issue of rationality in the postcolonial environment should be subject to a much more careful analysis than the knee-jerk reaction of Western modernists who are quick to dismiss value and religious systems of beliefs as superstition. Clifton Crais' (note 42) magisterial analysis of witchcraft beliefs in the Eastern Cape establishes that these beliefs have much to do with the politics of misfortune and trying to root out 'evil' in impoverished communities. 78. Nelson, Mandela, The Long Walk to Freedom (Randburg: MacDonald Purnell, 1994). 79. We discuss the deliberative model of democracy in view of the attempts of a coalition of 'traditional leaders' to appropriate the model for their own ends in a paper titled 'Deliberative Democracy and the Politics of Traditional Leadership in South Africa', currently under review with another journal, as well as in our chapter quoted above (note 75). There are several interpretations of a model of deliberation at work, and we argue that only one subject to vigilant oversight institutions at the provincial and national level as well as vibrant local participation is capable of producing democracy worthy of the name. The 'deliberative democracy' model certainly resonates with rural community traditions in Africa and could provide the basis for a more indigenous (as well as inclusive) form of democracy.

      "abstract": "Discourse ethics is originally conceived as a programme of philosophical justification of morality. This depends on the formal derivation of the moral principle (U) from non-moral principles. The moral theory is supposed to fall out of a pragmatic theory of meaning. The original programme plays a central role in Habermas's social theory: the moral theory, if true, provides good evidence for the more general theory of modernization. But neither Habermas nor his followers have succeeded in providing a formal derivation. This essay shows how and why Habermas's proposed derivation is impossible. As if aware of the lacuna, Habermas has recently suggested that (U) can be derived by 'abduction' rather than deduction. The proposal draws heavily on modernization theory; hence the only justification for (U) now available to him rests on premises drawn from that theory. The original programme of the justification of morality has thus given way to the weaker programme of the philosophical elucidation of morality. Further, since Habermas's moral theory is no longer justified independently of modernization theory, but at least partly by it, the moral theory cannot without circularity provide evidence for the modernization theory.",

I argue that, as a result of the liberalization and commercialization of the media, a new public sphere has emerged that can no longer be fully controlled by the state but that is increasingly indebted to Pentecostalism. Pentecostalism and video\u2010films come together and articulate alternative, Christian imaginations of modernity. Seeking to grasp the blurring of boundaries between religion and entertainment, I examine the pentecostalite cultural style on which these alternative visions thrive. My main concern is to investigate the specific mode through which Pentecostal expressive forms go public, thereby transforming the public sphere.",

Rather than displacing 'top-down' forms of monitoring, such practices emulate and amplify them, fostering the internalization of government strategies and their deployment in the private sphere. In an age in which everyone is to be considered potentially suspect, all are simultaneously urged to become spies.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Power in communication takes two main forms. As \u2018external\u2019 power, it consists in the ability to acknowledge or disregard a speaker or a discourse. As \u2018internal\u2019 power, it is the ability of an argument to eliminate other arguments by demonstrating its superiority. A positive or negative value may be ascribed to these forms of power. Four ideal\u2010typical positions are discussed \u2013 strategy, technocracy, constructionism, and deliberation. Public deliberation has three virtues \u2013 civic virtue, governance virtue and cognitive virtue. Deliberation lowers the propensity to, and the benefit of, strategic behaviour. It also increases knowledge, enhancing the quality of decisions. For Habermas, the unity of reason is expressed in the possibility of agreement on the most convincing argument. However, sometimes conflicts are deeplying, principles and factual descriptions are profoundly different, and uncertainty is radical. The best argument cannot be found. There is no universal reason. The question is whether non\u2010strategic agreement may spring from the incommensurability of languages. In search of an answer, Rawls's concept of overlapping consensus, the feminist theory of the public sphere, and the idea of deliberation as co\u2010operation are discussed. The argument developed is that the approach to deliberative democracy may be renewed by rethinking its motivational and cognitive elements. Public deliberation is grounded on a pre\u2010political level of co\u2010operation. Intractable controversies may be faced at the level of practices, looking for local, contextual answers.",

      "abstract": "Considering the damage caused by the recent spate of catastrophic events (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001, and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004), it is increasingly clear that complex, large-scale environmental problems will characterize the twenty-first century. We contend that the ability of science to address these problems is attenuated by the ideological embrace of scientific-technical rationality. With scientific and technological pursuits increasingly marching to the drum beat of economic growth, is there a place for science to operate driven not by short-term profitability, but the long-term interests of the public and needs of the environment? Can the problems associated with complex, large-scale catastrophes be addressed adequately by science and technology alone, especially considering that technological failure may be the primary cause of the catastrophe? The purpose of this article is to provide answers to these questions and to offer a tenable solution to the challenges posed by recent catastrophes. First, we outline a framework to better understand the changing relationship between science, stakeholders, and environmental problems. Second, we make the case that recent catastrophes are qualitatively different from past disasters. As a result, we discuss (1) the reasons why dichotomizing disasters as natural or technological is increasingly problematic empirically; and (2) the inability of traditional science to effectively address issues, damages, and problems stemming from recent catastrophes. Finally, we suggest that the more participatory approach of postnormal science, strengthened by the precautionary principle and worst-case analysis, is a viable strategy for addressing complex, large-scale catastrophes. With a primary focus on the historical transition from traditional societies to modern capitalist societies, Max Weber distilled from a complex analysis, rich in historical detail, an argument that centers on rationality. The defining feature of the mode of rationality responsible for the emergence of modern capitalist societies is the centrality of selecting the most efficient means to achieve a desired end. The forces of rationalization\u2014science, technology, economic growth, and especially bureaucracy\u2014pervade ever more spheres of life, supplanting preexisting social institutions and traditions. Another central feature of modernity involves the spread of diverse organizations into all dimensions of social life. In particular, the dependence on organizations to solve social problems has increased dramatically, especially problems that are complex and technical (Clarke 1999). Science and technology have both assumed an increasingly prominent role in the modern world. Since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, not only has science challenged religion and tradition as the only legitimate epistemology, but science itself has also emerged as one of the dominant ideologies of the modern era. As Habermas (1970) argued, in the modern world: Traditional legitimations could now be criticized against the standards of rationality of means\u2013ends relations. . . . We have followed this process of \"rationalization from above\" up to the point where technology and science themselves in the form of a common positivistic way of thinking, articulated as technocratic consciousness, began to take the role of a substitute ideology for the demolished bourgeois ideologies. (P. 114) During the twentieth century, scientific research has become increasingly wedded to the state, technology, and industry. More importantly, scientific-technical rationality has become as hegemonic as the ideologies it supplanted. As such, the pursuit of knowledge via science and the application of this knowledge (technology) have become the appropriate means of achieving a desired end. The scientific method \"perpetuates and extends itself not only through technology but as technology, and the latter provides the great legitimation of the expanding political power, which absorbs all spheres of culture\" (Marcuse 1964:158). Marcuse (1964), on one hand, acknowledged that the application of science to management and to the division of labor yielded an increased productivity of the economic, political, and cultural enterprise. On the other hand, he pointed out that \"this enterprise produced a pattern of mind and behavior which justified and absolved even the most destructive and oppressive features of the enterprise.\"\"Scientific-technical rationality,\" he argued, \"are welded together into new forms of social control\" (Marcuse 1964:146). In Robert Merton's seminal account of the \"ethos of science,\" he suggested that \"there was a necessary tension between the way science was internally organized and the way the capitalist economy worked. This [tension] was managed by preserving a certain autonomy for science\" (quote from Calhoun 2006:16). Since this classic account, the autonomy of science in academia and government has been steadily compromised by commercial interests (Ravetz 2004). For example, the cooptation of scientific-rationality and the method of science in industry is manifest in what researchers refer to as the \"triple helix,\" that is, the \"tight intertwining and mutual affinity of the government, commercial, and academic sectors . . .\" (Guston 2006:19). In a meta-analysis, Bekelman, Li, and Gross (2003) found strong evidence that biomedical research directly sponsored by industry is more likely to produce proindustrial conclusions. However, most would assume that scientists employed in academia and government would operate with relative autonomy. Western universities, developed during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were legally autonomous institutions, relatively free from outside forces and unique in world historical development (Huff 2006). For example, one historic advantage of academic science, primarily subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, was the creation and protection of a \"public research\" space, within which scholars could conduct research for the sake of the public good, free of the short-term constraints of commercial interests (Calhoun 2006; Washburn 2005). To whatever degree this \"space\" existed, it was undermined in the 1970s by a decrease in state funding, the restructuring of universities by corporate capitalism, and the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 (Calhoun 2006). The Bayh-Dole Act increased the integration of the university system and business, primarily through the narrow provision of federal funds for academic research which generate commercially viable products (Calhoun 2006). Although only 7.7 percent of university research in 2000 was funded by industry, patents granted to U.S. universities have increased dramatically, from only 96 patents in 1965 to 3200 in 2000 (Krimsky 2006). This trend suggests a more commercialized character has emerged in academic research. The autonomy of governmental scientists is also suspect, as they report \"greater constraints on their scientific autonomy than academic scientists . . .\" and those \"who speak freely end up either taking the role of 'whistle blower' or becoming marginalized by their federal agency\" (Krimsky 2006:25). Furthermore, in the United States, some evidence indicates that the regulatory process can be subverted via\"agency capture,\" that is when \"a regulatory agency comes to hold views more similar to the industry it is supposed to be regulating than the public it is supposed to protect\" (Gramling and Krogman 1997:21; see also, Freudenburg and Gramling 1994). As such, the autonomy of science in \"captured\" regulatory agencies is undoubtedly biased and constrained. We argue that the ability of science to address complex, large-scale environmental problems of our own making is attenuated by the ideological embrace of scientific-technical rationality, as it precludes reflexivity and discourages critical discourse. With scientific and technological pursuits increasingly marching to the drum beat of economic growth, is there a place for science to operate, driven not by short-term profitability, but the long-term interests of the public and needs of the environment? Can the problems associated with complex, large-scale catastrophes be addressed adequately by science and technology alone, especially considering that technological failure may be the primary cause of the catastrophe? The purpose of this article is to further explicate the issues above and to offer a tenable solution to the challenges posed by complex, large-scale catastrophes. First, we outline a framework in an effort to better understanding the changing relationship between science, stakeholders, and environmental problems. Second, we make the case that recent catastrophes are qualitatively different from past disasters. As a result, we discuss (1) the reasons why dichotomizing disasters as natural or technological is increasingly problematic empirically; and (2) the inability of traditional science (applied science and professional consultancy) to effectively address issues, damages, and problems stemming from recent catastrophes. Finally, we suggest that the more participatory approach of postnormal science, strengthened by the precautionary principle and worst-case analysis, is a viable strategy for addressing the complex, large-scale catastrophes of the twenty-first century. Funtowics and Ravetz (1992) distinguish between three different types of problem-solving strategies: applied science, professional consultancy, and postnormal science. In their framework, the horizontal axis in Figure 1 moves outward, from low to high systems uncertainty. Funtowics and Ravetz (1992) make a distinction between three levels of systems uncertainty. First, problems can be solved at the \"technical\" level, when uncertainty is managed via the standard procedures of applied science. With relatively low uncertainty, gathering appropriate empirical evidence and developing sound theories is possible and routine, thus allowing organizations to effectively plan for the future (Clarke 1999). Problem-Solving Strategies. (Used with authors' permission; Funtowics and Ravetz 1992.) Second, when problems are more complex and characterized by moderate levels of systems uncertainty, rigorous science may be conducted by multiple interests and presented in a politically contested arena where planning may be difficult, but not impossible (Clarke 1999). As such, the skills and personal judgments of professional consultants are required to solve the methodological problems of uncertainty, a solution that typically includes a debate about values and/or reliability (Funtowics and Ravetz 1992). Third, when the complexity of problems force the scientist to question the reducibility of uncertainties (or the uncertainty of uncertainty), and the knowability and controllability of risk, solutions are required at the \"epistemological\" level and must be solved through postnormal science (Funtowics and Ravetz 1992). Under such conditions the \"promise and apparatus of rational planning itself becomes mainly rhetorical, becomes a means by which plans\u2014independent of their functional relevance to the task\u2014can be justified as reasonable promises that exigencies can be controlled\" (Clarke 1999:4). The vertical axis in Figure 1 moves upward, from low to high decision stakes. Decision stakes are understood as the costs and benefits of various policy decisions for all parties that are impacted by the issue at hand. Applied science is an adequate strategy when systems uncertainty and decision stakes are low. When systems uncertainty and decision stakes are medium, professional consultancy is necessary and may supplement applied science. Taken together, applied science and professional consultancy form what is commonly known as traditional science. Finally, the strategy of postnormal science becomes critical when systems uncertainty and decision stakes are high. The necessity of using one of these three strategies for problem solving does not preclude the necessity of using the others. In fact, some complex problems may require the use of all three strategies. We will now discuss the problem-solving strategies of applied science and professional consultancy in greater detail. The first problem-solving strategy identified by Funtowics and Ravetz (1992) is \"applied science\" or in Kuhn's (1962) parlance, \"puzzle-solving.\" Applied science adheres to the canons of science advocated since the seventeenth century and is based on a reductionistic, linear, mechanistic model of the empirical world. Applied science produced \"objective\" knowledge through scientific expertise, marginalized the public as nonexperts, and discounted lay knowledge as value-laden (Marshall and Goldstein 2006). In policy debates, scientific experts opted for a role of value neutrality. In general, scientific claims of expertise were not questioned by the public. Most accepted science as the dominant epistemology and believed that the method of science produced empirical evidence devoid of biases related to personality, politics, and commercialism. Legitimate knowledge was built largely on trust in expert systems located in organizations (Marshall and Goldstein 2006). Although applied science is not overtly politicized, strict adherence to the canons of science does have policy implications. For example, convention suggests that scientists must be reasonably confident that a hypothesized relationship exists empirically before the findings are added to an accumulated body of knowledge. As such, scientists would rather commit a Type I error, not finding a relationship when it exists, than a Type II error, finding a relationship when it does not exist (Lemons, Shrader-Frechette, and Cranor 1997). This convention, although cogent when the goal is to accumulate knowledge, is problematic when decision stakes and systems uncertainty are high. For example, if the task of the researcher is to assess whether or not the industrial release of a toxic chemical into the environment will have adverse effects on people living in that environment, privileging Type I errors over Type II errors is at odds with the health concerns of the community. Of course, the community would rather have scientists' error on the side of caution\u2014that is, finding a relationship when it does not exist, rather than not finding a relationship when it does exist. More broadly and critically, privileging Type I errors over Type II errors is a methodological choice that, intentionally or unintentionally, supports a political-economic system which places a higher value on economic growth than the health of the environment and/or people (Ravetz 2004). Another example of the ramifications of following the conventions of applied science is the 95 percent rule in community health cases. The implications were evocatively captured by Beverly Paigen (as quoted in Brown 1997), a New York state geneticist who worked with victims of Love Canal. In describing her epiphany, Paigen states that: Before Love Canal, I also needed a 95 percent certainty before I was convinced of a result. But seeing this rigorously applied in a situation where the consequences of an error meant that pregnancies were resulting in miscarriages, stillbirths, and children with medical problems, I realized I was making a value judgment . . . whether to make errors on the side of protecting human health or on the side of conserving state resources. (P. 16) In both the hypothetical case and at Love Canal, the decision by scientists to follow the canons of science is a value judgment that privileges scientific rigor over individual and community health. In the United States, rather than requiring proof of pre hoc nontoxicity before certain toxic chemicals are released into the environment, the regulatory/legal system requires proof of post hoc toxicity when assessing whether or not community health problems are a result of toxic chemical exposure. Methodologically, the burden is shifted from proving that a cause-and-effect relationship does not exist between chemical exposure and health in a laboratory setting, where experimental designs allow for control of external factors, to the field, where it is impossible to control for numerous external factors with any degree of certainty. While shifting the burden of proof benefits those who produce and release hazardous materials, it harms the environment, individuals, and communities. This shift is a concrete example of the CCPP game (Hardin 1985) through which the costs of industrial and agricultural production are commonized (CC), while the profits are privatized (PP). Beginning in World War II and rapidly developing in the 1950s, applied science blurred the distinction between \"scientific validity\" and \"engineering feasibility\" which, in turn, resulted in the unleashing of unanticipated environmental risks (Funtowics and Ravetz 1992). The emergence of unanticipated environmental problems, characterized by medium levels of systems uncertainty and decision stakes, pointed to the inadequacy of applied science and thus the necessity for alternative problem-solving strategies. \"Professional consultancy\" entered the public decision-making arena in the United States in response to technological disasters, especially Love Canal, Three Mile Island, Times Beach, and Bhopal. These failures of technology, which elevated risks to human health, exposed the fallibility and inadequacy of applied science, thereby creating conditions conducive for the emergence of the strategy of professional consultancy (Funtowics and Ravetz 1992). Applied scientists and professional consultants analyze problems as employees of formal organizations. A key difference between the applied scientist and professional consultant is that \"the [applied] scientist's task is completed when he has solved a problem that in principle can function as a contribution to a body of knowledge, the professional's task involves the welfare of a client, and the science that is deployed for that is subsidiary to that goal\" (Funtowics and Ravetz 1992:256). Organizations analyze problems by transforming scientific uncertainty into risks (Clarke 1999). Simply defined, risk refers to the \"combination of two factors: the probability that a potentially harmful event will occur; and the potential damage such an occurrence would cause\" (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, 2003:30). Ideally, for organizations to maintain legitimacy as problem solvers astutely guided by scientific-technical rationality, they must (1) solve problems as reservoirs of expert knowledge and wielders of instrumental rationality; and (2) convince others that they can solve problems as purveyors of symbolic rationality (Clarke 1999). We suggest that when scientific uncertainty and decision stakes are low, applied scientists can effectively maintain instrumental and symbolic rationality and, as a result, organizational legitimacy is not threatened. As scientific uncertainty increases, organizations are charged with the \"onerous task of effectively transforming uncertainty into risk even without a sufficient experiential base or conceptual scheme appropriate for interpreting history\" (Clarke 1999:12, italics in original). Under such conditions, the uncertainty-to-risk transformation fails to solve the problem and the professional consultant may forsake instrumental rationality, instead seeking to maintain organizational legitimacy through symbolic planning and the creation of \"fantasy documents\" (Clarke 1999). Even when problems are characterized by low uncertainty and organizations develop plans that are operational, planning is symbolic in the sense that it serves to convince the public that organizations have the expertise necessary to solve problems (Clarke 1999). In his book, Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents to Tame Disaster, Clarke (1999) argues that when scientific uncertainty is high and risks are unknowable and uncontrollable, organizations develop plans that symbolically transform uncertainty into risk by using rhetoric. Scientific expertise, in this case, is manufactured and hoarded by generating esoteric knowledge and discounting competing perspectives. Fantasy documents are symbolic plans that are to convince people that risks of technology are and (Clarke and As decision stakes with the public that documents are a of organizations potentially a legitimation consultancy exposed science for a value-laden in an arena with multiple stakeholders, with making claims by of traditional science argue that the of the scientist is a research may be most research is politicized, and funded research are increasingly wedded to commercial interests (Marshall and Goldstein 2006). Furthermore, as the relationship between environmental problems and technological failure increasingly the in science and trust of scientists has and and Goldstein 2006; the trust in organizations responsible for risk management and has steadily over the past and and research has found evidence of a relationship between low levels of trust in organizations and levels of environmental and 1992).

      "abstract": "In your works, you make a strong claim about the usefulness -if not inevitability -of historical approaches to the social sciences and philosophy.Before we go into more detail -do you think there is a central reason of why to make use of history in general?There is a central reason: the inevitability of the narrative as a way of self-understanding.You could put it this way: as a theory of natural science, the inverse-square law is completely timeless; it does not just apply here and now.You don't need to talk about development.So it may look as though a, let's call it, 'human' way of understanding is subscientific and you should get rid of it.Why I am so and so?Why do I act the way I do?The ideal seems to be to come up with timeless statements of what you believe or what motivates you.But this turns out not to be so.Alasdair MacIntyre says that understanding is narrative and that seems plainly true; but why?It has to do with the manner in which we actually understand things, which is in the order in which we grasp them, moving from an early state of confusion or disorientation, until you get the point.So the issue is: can that understanding be separable from the process of getting at it?In very many cases in life it can't be, because we understand what we now see as a truth as a result of an error-correction in relation to an earlier view.When people say in the modern secular age: \"human beings stand on their own feet\", this idea is what I would call a 'transitional understanding,' an understanding based on a transition from the old days when we were under the thrall of traditions.Descartes really does this: ordinarily what we believe is what we were told by your preceptors, but I must take a step back and ask \"what do I know now?\".I get a sense of my own orientation as coming about through that radical shift, and here I discover a method.But the method itself only makes sense in terms of that transition: I'm understanding myself in opposition to a supposed past.There is an inescapable narrative dimension to this.So much so that you upset somebody's view of their history by upsetting their views of the past, which is why 'history wars' are so central to political and intellectual life. So you're saying that just as individual lives and identities are narrative-like, the understanding required in social sciences is narrative-like as well?Yes, there is an element of narrativity that can't be entirely cancelled out.Of course you do have also things like supposedly general laws and they are part of the understanding in the social sciences, but narratives are nevertheless essential.Take economics: the modern centrality of markets arose in history at a certain time, it didn't exist before.Furthermore, the markets themselves are differently embedded in a different society, and all that is understood in terms of transitions from earlier situations.Karl Polanyi re-writes the history of the modern market in a way that was not what the classic economists understood, and this new story upset the whole previous understanding. 1In opposition to the prevailing dictum of 'historical objectivity,' Nietzsche sets the following task for the historian in his second Untimely Meditations 2 : to go beyond the passive observation of the flux of 'events' (Ereignisse) and grasp the 'forces' (Kr\u00e4fte) that animated the past, assuming what were the 'instincts' of previous generations.Do you see a similitude between Nietzsche's notions and your own concepts in your historically oriented works?A likely candidate could be what you called \"id\u00e9es forces,\" 3 aiming at the",

      "abstract": "SPECTERS ARE ONCE AGAIN HAUNTING EUROPE AND AMERICA\u2014as are magicians, mermaids, mesmerists, and a melange of marvels once thought to have been exorcised by the rational and secular processes of modernity. In recent years, historians from disparate fields have independently challenged the long-standing sociological view that modernity is characterized by \u201cdisenchantment.\u201d This view, in its broadest terms, maintains that wonders and marvels have been demystified by science, spirituality has been supplanted by secularism, spontaneity has been replaced by bureaucratization, and the imagination has been subordinated to instrumental reason. In the past decade, however, a new historiographic position, if not consensus, has emerged that presents Western modernity as \u201cenchanted.\u201d The ongoing redefinition of such an established view is of consequence for a variety of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the master narratives underlying the stories that historians choose to tell. As Dipesh Chakrabarty usefully reminds us, \u201cThe moment we think of the world as disenchanted . . . we set limits to the ways the past can be narrated.\u201d1 The emergent view that modernity is as enchanted as it is disenchanted may conjure alternative vistas to the historical imagination, and at the very least offers the possibility of pulling new rabbits out of old hats. Narrating a historiography of \u201cmodernity and enchantment\u201d has limitations of its own, however. Those historians who challenge the equation of modernity with disenchantment often present their views within the context of topical debates in their respective fields. It will therefore be useful to tease out some of the common concerns and findings that have appeared in otherwise distinct areas of study, such as the histories of science, religion, and mass culture. The works examined here are necessarily eclectic, drawn primarily from European and American histories of these subfields, but they are nevertheless representative of how the topic is currently being handled across historical specialties. A second challenge has to do with defining such inherently vague and complex terms as \u201cmodernity\u201d and \u201cenchantment.\u201d Taken separately, each term has manifold meanings. When the two terms are paired under a particular interpretation of the relationship between \u201cmodernity and enchantment,\u201d however, each assumes greater",

      "abstract": "In this article we develop a conceptualization of business ethics as practice. Starting from the view that the ethics that organizations display in practice will have been forged through an ongoing process of debate and contestation over moral choices, we examine ethics in relation to the ambiguous, unpredictable, and subjective contexts of managerial action. Furthermore, we examine how discursively constituted practice relates to managerial subjectivity and the possibilities of managers being moral agents. The article concludes by discussing how the \u2018ethics as practice\u2019 approach that we expound provides theoretical resources for studying the different ways that ethics manifest themselves in organizations as well as providing a practical application of ethics in organizations that goes beyond moralistic and legalistic approaches.",

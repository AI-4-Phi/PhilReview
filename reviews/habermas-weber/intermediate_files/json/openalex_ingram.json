      "abstract": "Abstract It is the persistence of social suffering in a world in which it could be eliminated that for Adorno is the source of the need for critical reflection, for philosophy. Philosophy continues and gains its cultural place because an as yet unbridgeable abyss separates the social potential for the relief of unnecessary human suffering and its emphatic continuance. Philosophy now is the culturally bound repository for the systematic acknowledgement and articulation of the meaning of the expanse of human suffering within technologically advanced societies that are already committed to liberal ideals of freedom and equality.

Revue Internationale de Philosophie, 63(227), pp. 69\u201383; and Lambert Zuidervaart, 'Metaphysics after Auschwitz: Suffering and Hope in Adorno's Negative Dialectics', forthcoming. The existence of this splendid set of essays means that in this essay I shall be able to concentrate on philosophical matters since so much of the hard work of textual analysis and interpretation has already been done. 4 For a potent critique of liberal justice along these lines see Norman Geras, The Contract of Mutual Indifference: Political Philosophy after the Holocaust (London: Verso, 1998). For an elaboration of the thesis that liberal justice, Kantian liberal universalism, has already internalized Hobbesian instrumentalism as its premise see my Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001), Ch. 3. 5 See, for example, Deborah Cook, Adorno, Habermas, and the Search for a Rational Society (London: Routledge, 2004);Yvonne Sherratt, Adorno's Positive Dialectic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002); Gerhard Schweppenh\u00e4user, Ethik nach Auschwitz: Adornos negative Moralphilosophie (Hamburg: Argument Verlag, 1993), and his 'Adorno's Negative Moral Philosophy', in Tom Huhn (ed.)

Habermas: A Critical Reader (Oxford: Blackwell, 1999), p. 326. 10 Ibid., p. 324. 11 It should be acknowledged that the collapse in the authority of liberal ideals in democratic societies over the past twenty\u2010five years has made the business of once again elaborating them have more point than I would have imagined possible in 1968, say. But that reasonable task still should not be confused with the generation of a Critical Theory of society. 12 Honneth, 'The Social Dynamics of Disrespect', p. 328. Notice that the price Honneth must immediately pay for his theory of misrecognition is its divorce from the fundamental mechanisms of societal rationalization. The right thing to say here is that, post Marx and Weber, there is a systematic dislocation between social suffering and macro societal rationalization, and hence the hope of building a social theory in which the movement of the former became the route for the resolution of the latter \u2013 the classical model of revolutionary praxis \u2013 is now unavailable. 13 Ibid., p. 329. 14 Ibid. 15 The Struggle for Recognition, p. 135. 16 Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth, Redistribution or Recognition?

In Excitable Speech: A Politics of Performance (New York: Routledge, 1997), 'Introduction' and Ch. 4, Butler gives a first sketch of how 'words wound', that is, how our socially constituted independence and vulnerability are reiterated at the linguistic level. 25 'The Social Dynamics of Disrespect', p. 332. In 'A Social Pathology of Reason: On the Intellectual Legacy of Critical Theory', trans. James Hebbeler, in Fred Rush (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Critical Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), Honneth states that the ethical core contained in the idea of Critical Theory is of a socially deficient rationality (pp.338\u201345). In that place, I cannot tell if Honneth is associating himself with that idea, or just recording it as a historical matter of fact. 26 'Progress', in Critical Models, p. 152. 27 'Adorno's Negative Moral Philosophy', p. 330. 28 Of course, I am not denying that in part 'the social pathologies of the present can be understood as the result of the inability of society to properly express the rational potential already inherent in its institutions, practices, and everyday routines' ('A Social Pathology of Reason', p. 340), only that, as will be evident directly, in purveying a formal theory of the good, Honneth cleanses present ideals of their implication in social pathology. Part of the reason that I find Marx's 'On the Jewish Question' so exemplary is that he there manages to continue the argument of the Philosophy of Right whilst simultaneously providing an immanent critique. This might just be a debate about how to identify 'societies' inabilities'. 29 Simon Jarvis, 'Adorno, Marx, Materialism', in The Cambridge Companion to Adorno, pp. 88\u20139. 30 'Progress', p. 149. 31 When Marx urges that all rights are rights to inequality, he should not be interpreted as urging that no one should (need to) have rights (because in an ideal state of affairs they would not be necessary); his point is rather the dialectical one: that rights as they now are preserve the very lacks their possession promises \u2013 the right to vote as a continuation of disenfranchisement, the right to welfare as a way of keeping people impoverished. 32 Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, The Politics of Aesthetics: The Distribution of the Sensible, trans.

The paper focuses on the in\ufb02uence of Enlightenment thought on U.S. Western resource policy and examines four dimensions including the relationship between humans and nature; the concept of rationality; the nature of science; and social relations among humans. Alternative theoretical principles suggested by ecosystem management are discussed.

      "abstract": "Technology enactment, an analytical framework that focuses on the processes by which new information and communication technologies come to be used by organizational actors, is distinctly institutional in orientation. An institutional perspective provides a challenge to researchers to integrate attention to structure, politics, and policy into studies of e-government. It also invites attention to the roles and relationships of formal and informal institutions. Formal institutions\u2014laws, reg- ulations, budget processes, and other governmental procedures\u2014are central to legitimation and shaping incentives for the use of ICT as an integral and inseparable set of elements in the administrative state. Informal institutions\u2014networks, norms, and trust\u2014are equally influential. Challenges in the development of e-government stem from core issues of liberty, freedom, participation, and other central elements of democracy. Structurally, however, such challenges may be viewed through an institutional lens in terms of the adequacy of formal and informal institutions to support e-government. An institutional perspective, drawing primarily from economic sociology as well as from the institutional turn in economics, provides a path to deepening studies of information and communication technologies in government in ways that can illuminate state development and capacity. In addition, this chapter describes key institutional developments in e-government during two presidential administrations in the United States as well as key developments in state and local U.S. government.",

This article enters the void with a project in which breast cancer survivors used collages and installations of everyday objects to solicit their authentic expression of the psycho-social impacts of lymphedema. The article enlists Jurgen Habermas' communicative action theory to explore the potential of these expressive arts to expand participants' meaningful engagement with their lifeworlds. The findings point to the unique non-linguistic discursivity of these non-institutional artistic forms as their liberating power to disclose silenced human needs: the images 'spoke' for themselves for group members to recognize shared subjectivities. The authenticity claims inherent in the art forms fostered collective reflexivity and spontaneous, affective responses and compelled the group to create new collective understandings of the experience of living with lymphedema. The article contributes theoretical insights regarding the emancipatory potential of aesthetic-expressive rationality, an under-developed area of Habermasian theory of communicative action, and to the burgeoning literature on arts-based methods in social scientific research.",

Whether it is in relation to climate change, disease outbreaks, financial volatility, natural disasters or political settlements, every media headline seems to assert that things are uncertain, and increasingly so. Uncertainty, where we do not know the probabilities of either likelihoods or outcomes, is different to risk, the implications of which are explored in this paper through five different ways of thinking about uncertainty, derived from highly diverse literatures encompassing&#13;\\nsocietal, political, cultural, practice and individual perspectives.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe paper continues by examining how these perspectives relate to four domains: finance and banking;&#13;\\ncritical infrastructures; disease outbreaks and climate change; natural hazards and disasters. Reflecting&#13;\\non these experiences, the paper argues that embracing uncertainty raises some fundamental&#13;\\nchallenges. It means questioning simple, linear perspectives on modernity and progress. It means&#13;\\nrethinking expertise and including diverse knowledges in deliberations about the future. It means&#13;\\nunderstanding how uncertainties emerge in social, political and economic contexts, and how&#13;\\nuncertainties affect different people, depending on class, gender, race, age and other dimensions of&#13;\\nsocial difference. And, if uncertainty is not reducible to probabilistic risk, it means a radically different&#13;\\napproach to governance; one that rejects control-oriented, technocratic approaches in favour of more&#13;\\ntentative, adaptive, hopeful and caring responses.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe paper concludes by asking whether we can learn from those who live with and from uncertainty \u2013&#13;\\nincluding pastoralists in marginal settings \u2013 as part of a wider conversation about embracing&#13;\\nuncertainties to meet the challenges of our turbulent world.",

      "abstract": "Self practices \u2013 mental and bodily activities through which individuals try to give a shape to their existence \u2013 have been a topic of interest in the social science literature for over a century now. These studies bring into focus that such activities play important roles in our relationship to our social environment. But beyond this general insight we still do not have a framework for elucidating what kind of roles/uses have been attributed to self practices by social theorists historically. Through an analysis of the works of 5 major contributors to the literature (Durkheim, Mauss, Simmel, Giddens and Foucault), the article highlights three distinct conceptualizations, which draw attention to the adaptive, defensive and transformative uses of self practices. Adaptive uses allow individuals to adjust their conduct to collective norms; defensive uses serve the maintenance and protection of self-identity despite de-individualizing pressures; and transformative self practices target the development of alternative ways of living. It is further suggested that the framework developed in the article can provide important clues about the different \u2018practical\u2019 solutions offered by social theorists to the problems that modern individuals face in constituting themselves as autonomous subjects.",

Its argumentative core boils down to the promotion of intersectional egalitarianism (socio-economic, gender, racial-ethnic, environmental) through digital inclusion, which seems only feasible to us from a perspective capable of accommodating the normative claims of a critical decolonial theory combined with a naturalistic view of sustainability, within a research program that I dubbed \u201cmitigated social constructionism\u201d in response to the phenomenological deficit of normative and naturalistic theories (including critical theory and neurophilosophy). If what matters is normativity, then to avoid the divide between naturalism and non-naturalist normativity one nonfoundationalist alternative is to resort to hermeneutical and procedural accounts of normativity as helpful clues to making sense of the naturalism-normativity problem, avoiding reductionist interpretations of both naturalism (Churchland) and normativism (Parfit).",

In their attempt to develop an interdisciplinary, reflexive, emancipatory and dialectical reason that is critical towards accepted realities, Horkheimer and Adorno in their monumental work The Dialectic of Enlightenment pictured a world trapped in instrumental rationality. Taking and revolutionizing traditional critical theory, Habermas argues that reason entails both emancipator as well as instrumental possibilities. Through an exposition of Habermas\u2019 critique of Horkheimer and Adorno in his discourse of modernity, this article argues that although Habermas successfully identifies the equation of the rational with the instrumental and offers an emancipator model in return; still he ends up not paying sufficient attention to aesthetic truth.",

After a brief discussion of what is ideology as opposed to truth, the author proposes a thesis about ideology, identity and power, and several heuristic ideas how to develop it. In the third part, he briefly provides examples from political and policy analysis that correspond to such a project. In the final part, he explains the importance of preserving the distinction between ideology and truth in the discursively postulated \u201cpost-truth\u201d era.

      "abstract": "Radical/extremist Islamist actors use social media to disseminate uncompromising stories of monist religious political orders and identities. As a reaction, counter-movements to online Islamist radicalism/extremism emerged in Western societies (and beyond), while uncertainty about effective outcomes remains widespread. In a bid to understand how inclusionary and exclusionary discursive spaces are created, we ask: How do some Muslim actors create discursive spaces open to self-reflection, pluralism and liberal-democratic principles, while others construct illiberal, particularistic and non/anti-democratic spaces? To respond to this question, we compare two contrasting storytellers, one who agitates for exclusionary Islamist radicalism/extremism (Generation Islam) and one who offers inclusionary prevention and deradicalization work against that (Jamal al-Khatib). We draw on novel narrative approaches to the Discourse Historical Approach (DHA) in Critical Discourse Studies (CDS), via which we compare text-level and context-level narratives disseminated about three Muslim-related crises: the racist terrorist attacks/genocide to represent the national, European and global level. Our two-layered, DHA-inspired narrative analysis illustrates that, at the level of text, narrative persuasion varies between both contrasting actors. While Jamal al-Khatib disseminates persuasive stories, Generation Islam is much less invested in narrative persuasion; it seems to address an already convinced audience. These two text-level strategies reveal their meaning in two antagonistic narrative genres: Jamal al-Khatib\u2019s \u201cself-reflexive savior\u201d creates an inclusionary discursive space represented in a self-ironic narrative genre, while Generation Islam\u2019s \u201dcrusading savior\u201d manufactures an exclusionary discursive space represented in a romance featuring a nostalgic return to the particularistic Islamic umma.",

      "abstract": "Megachurch pastors\u2014as local and international celebrities\u2014have been a growing phenomenon since the 1960s, when megachurches began to proliferate across North America. Why are these leaders and their large congregations so popular in an age of increasing \u201creligious nones\u201d? Commentators in both popular and academic literature often resort to characterizing the leadership with stereotypes of manipulative opportunists along the lines of Sinclair Lewis\u2019 Elmer Gantry (1927) or narrow characterizations of savvy entrepreneurs who thrive in a competitive religious economy. Similarly, writers assume megachurch attendees are a passive audience, or even dupes.&#13;\\nThis dissertation challenges the Elmer Gantry stereotype and the religious economic perspectives by examining one particular megachurch pastor named Bruxy Cavey in the context of his \u201cirreligious\u201d megachurch community called The Meeting House. It argues that charismatic leadership, not calculated management and branding techniques, best explains the rapid growth of this megachurch as well as the deep commitments many people make to it. While the concept of \u201ccharisma\u201d is often used equivocally, in the tradition of Max Weber I contend that charismatic authority is best understood not only as an extraordinary individual quality but as a form of cultural authority that arises when traditional and institutional forms have lost their plausibility and people experience uncertainty, dissatisfaction, or distress. People attribute exemplary powers to someone who offers them a way out, and intellectually and emotionally bond with the visionary and their vision. This charismatic authority I portray as a dramatic production, what I call a \u201cdramatic web\u201d that draws followers into its scene and script, offering some resolution to their worries. The complex, compelling nature of this drama is best understood in the context of Wendy Griswold\u2019s \u201ccultural diamond,\u201d which proposes four elements in the analysis of a cultural object: the cultural object itself, its creators, its receivers, and the social world that encapsulates them all.&#13;\\nI investigate the four elements as part of a \u201ccharismatic diamond\u201d: the cultural object is the \u201cdramatic web\u201d of Cavey\u2019s church, marketed as \u201ca church for people who aren\u2019t into church\u201d; the creators are Cavey and his staff, who employ a variety of media to generate and disseminate the drama; the social world is a Canadian culture ambivalent about religion and which stigmatizes right-wing evangelicals; the receivers are various concentric circles of audience who participate in the subculture of the church to varying degrees.&#13;\\n\\tFollowing the dramaturgical themes of Erving Goffman, I investigate the \u201cdramatic web\u201d of The Meeting House in two parts\u2014as a deconstructive, satirical project displayed on Sunday mornings and then as a re-constructive, romantic adventure that is exemplified in weekday Home Churches. For the first, I show Cavey deliberately takes \u201crole distance\u201d from the stereotype of a right-wing evangelical pastor, using satire to deconstruct the mores of North American evangelical culture and create an \u201calienating effect\u201d in his audience. The negatively oriented opening acts create a space in which a new script can be constructed, and I demonstrate next Cavey\u2019s two core romantic narratives that champion \u201crelationship, not religion\u201d\u2014a script that is to be enacted through their weekday Home Churches. Not all attendees are caught up in this dramatic web to the same degree, however, as attendees select elements from it for their own purposes, some embracing and identifying with the whole script, while others take pieces from it to arrange into a more eclectic religious life.&#13;\\nThe final chapter explores moments of \u201cdramaturgical trouble,\u201d including the question of what happens when Cavey retires, dies, or is deposed. In other words, how might this religious performance come to an end? I offer a typology of possible endings and their sequels\u2014three scenarios of charismatic succession I developed from Weber\u2019s writing on the routinization of charisma. The dissertation concludes by suggesting that, contrary to predictions of the megachurches demise, if megachurches indeed are a compelling drama co-produced by leader and follower that brings meaning, purpose, and joy to followers\u2019 lives in the midst of cultural tension, megachurches are not just a passing fad or vulnerable personality cult, but a viable and likely enduring North American religious institution.",

      "abstract": "As its title suggests, this dissertation examines second/foreign language literature teaching (and learning) with an emphasis on linguistic approaches to the study of literature. The approaches referred to are those which theorise language use this includes literary texts as a communicative context, that is, functional grammar and critical discourse analysis. The dissertation argues for the inclusion of literary texts in second/foreign language teaching and learning on the grounds that, at higher education level, the study of literature can develop in students important knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes which are necessary both for their (the students') functioning in a multicultural society, and for the development of a critical civil society, as outlined in current policy documents relating to the transformation of the South African higher education system. The dissertation consists of two distinct parts: a theoretical section, followed by a practical application. In the theoretical section, a rationale is developed for the inclusion of second/foreign language literature. The following critical questions are asked: 1. What place do second/foreign language literary studies have in the present higher education context? This question is explored against the background of present higher education policy. 2. What place could, or perhaps should, second/foreign language literary studies have, or rather, which knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes can be taught using them? Here, theories of understanding (Gadamer and Habermas), as well as their bearing on language learning and the development of critical thought, are discussed. 3. Which theories of language and discourse can be used to develop the critical understanding, interpretation and communication skills that are required in society? The goal of this exploration is to gauge which theories best address the requirement of higher education to produce criticality. To round the dissertation off, an attempt is then made to apply the considerations developed in 1 3 in a concrete classroom situation. For this purpose, a teaching and learning project that took place in the second semester of 2000, is described, and its results evaluated and discussed, against the background of what is presently required of higher education in terms of its contribution to society.",

      "abstract": "This paper intends to review the concept of alienation in the \"mature\" works of A. Giddens, J. Habermas and N. Luhmann. In the context of recent contributions to the mentioned concept, it becomes necessary to rethink its place in these theorizations. In order to do so, we will first examine the different perspectives and background of the current blooming of alienation, to arrive at a global definition of it that will avoid its \"essencialist\" character. This outline will connect us to various fundamental dimensions of its analysis: the study of social totality, torn and alienated because of a \"lack of relation\"; the question of community confronted to this notion of alienation; and the link between this process of alienation and the individual, specially in its experience assumed as \u201cauthentic\u201d of the self and of the social membership. In second place, we will make a reading of these dimensions in the theories of A. Giddens's, J. Habermas's and N. Luhmann's diagnoses of late modernity. This will allow a reinterpretation of their critiques towards the concept of alienation. This is how we will conduct an unexplored analysis of their works, pointing out decisive tensions in their theories, sometimes unresolved. In this way, we will study alienation specially in connection to: the problem of social order and anchorage of time and space in \"reflexive communities\" and \"pure relationships\" (A. Giddens); modernity's pathologies in communicative action and the possibility of a \"community of communication\" (J. Habermas); and religious communication, the exclusion of functional differentiation, and the modern codification of intimacy in love (N. Luhmann).",

      "abstract": "Diese Dissertation besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit einer systematischen Organisation der epistemologischen Dimension des menschlichen Wissens in Bezug auf Perspektiven und Methoden. Insbesondere wird untersucht inwieweit das bekannte Organisationsprinzip der integrativen Ebenen, das eine Hierarchie zunehmender Komplexit\u00e4t und Integration beschreibt, geeignet ist f\u00fcr eine grundlegende Klassifikation von Perspektiven bzw. epistemischen Bezugsrahmen. Die zentrale These dieser Dissertation geht davon aus, dass eine angemessene Analyse solcher epistemischen Kontexte in der Lage sein sollte, unterschiedliche oder gar konfligierende Bezugsrahmen anhand von kontext\u00fcbergreifenden Standards und Kriterien vergleichen und bewerten zu k\u00f6nnen. Diese Aufgabe erfordert theoretische und methodologische Grundlagen, welche die Beschr\u00e4nkungen eines radikalen Kontextualismus vermeiden, insbesondere die ihm innewohnende Gefahr einer Fragmentierung des Wissens aufgrund der angeblichen Inkommensurabilit\u00e4t epistemischer Kontexte. Basierend auf J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2018 Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns und seiner Methodologie des hermeneutischen Rekonstruktionismus, wird argumentiert, dass epistemischer Pluralismus nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig zu epistemischem Relativismus f\u00fchren muss und dass eine systematische Organisation der Perspektivenvielfalt von bereits existierenden Modellen zur kognitiven Entwicklung profitieren kann, wie sie etwa in der Psychologie oder den Sozial- und Kulturwissenschaften rekonstruiert werden. Der vorgestellte Ansatz versteht sich als ein Beitrag zur multi-perspektivischen Wissensorganisation, der sowohl neue analytische Werkzeuge f\u00fcr kulturvergleichende Betrachtungen von Wissensorganisationssystemen bereitstellt als auch neue Organisationsprinzipien vorstellt f\u00fcr eine Kontexterschlie\u00dfung, die dazu beitragen kann die Ausdrucksst\u00e4rke bereits vorhandener Dokumentationssprachen zu erh\u00f6hen. Zudem enth\u00e4lt der Anhang eine umfangreiche Zusammenstellung von Modellen integrativer Wissensebenen.",

Door democratie op deze manier te conceptualiseren kunnen we tot een begrip hiervan komen dat daadwerkelijk emancipatie en participatie voorstaat. \\n\\nWat is democratie? Het onderzoek van Van der Veeke richt zich op de vraag hoe wij de lange traditie van de kritische filosofie op zo\u2019n manier kunnen inzetten om tot een hernieuwd begrip van democratie te komen. Het huidige concept verwijst enerzijds naar een formeel systeem dat de wil van het volk tot uitdrukking zou moeten brengen. Anderzijds wordt het begrip gebruikt om een politieke en sociale situatie te duiden als al dan niet democratisch. Het concept \u2018democratie\u2019 kent dus zowel een quasi objectieve en descriptieve betekenis als een kritische en normatieve betekenis. Deze twee vormen gaan onmogelijk samen en geven geen bevredigend antwoord op de vraag wat democratie eigenlijk is. \\n\\nVertrekpunt\\nVan der Veeke stelt dat we bij het duiden van de huidige samenleving niet moeten vertrekken vanuit individuen of identiteiten (zoals de burger of de rechtspersoon) die een bepaalde structuur tot stand brengen, maar juist vanuit de dynamieken tussen sociale actoren en praktijken. In plaats van over democratie te denken in zijn huidige parlementaire, rigide vorm, moeten we democratie zien als een praktijk van deliberatie (beraadslaging) binnen, en aanvechting van, bestaande politieke en sociale instituties.\\n\\nDit hernieuwde begrip van democratie is dynamisch en kent nooit zijn ultieme voltooiing in een systeem. Van der Veeke stelt dat het de rol van de intellectueel of de kritische filosoof is om dit begrip uit te dragen en om mensen te motiveren tot handelen tegen vormen van dominantie over te gaan, zij het niet op een belerende manier. De intellectueel zou niet vanuit een objectivistisch standpunt uitspraken moeten doen over de (politieke of sociale) werkelijkheid, maar zich moeten committeren aan bepaalde individuen of groepen. Hij zou zich ook moeten beroepen op een vorm van progressief denken op basis van de waarden van de Verlichting: vrijheid, gelijkheid en solidariteit. \\n\\nHet begrip 'democratie' staat hierbij altijd in relatie tot een zogenaamde \u2018ethische horizon\u2019, iets wat we volgens Van der Veeke het beste kunnen duiden als het principe van intellectuele gelijkheid, het toeschrijven van het vermogen aan een ieder om het goede leven te kunnen visualiseren en uit te drukken - met betrekking tot het eigen leven en dat van anderen.\\n\\n\\n",

      "abstract": "This thesis examines the societal forces which have helped shape the present-day form of the institutionalization, criticism, and appreciation of art. Specifically, it examines the influence of modern thought on our present understanding of art. First, we examine how modernists have typically 100ked at art. Both the enlightening aspects as well as the deficiencies of modernist aesthetics are uncovered. Also, with the help of Jurgen Habermas, we examine a modernist societal approach to aesthetics. Second, the fundamental philosophical presuppositions of modernity are uncovered so that the societal forces that have helped to make art an autonomous institutionalized field of expertise can be examined. In passing, we discuss the concept of \"lifeworld\". We then examine the explanatory powers of considering the arts as forms of language. Third, as Habermas's social theory indicates, an excursion into the theory of argumentation provides indications of the mechanisms involved in the understanding of art. We consider the rhetorical, dialectical, and logical aspects of both non-verbal and linguistic argumentation. This provides us with a forum for discussing Habermas' s notion of an ideal speech situation, Gadamer's concept of the various modes of iii experiencing tradition and its parallel with the experiencing of art, and Quine's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation and what it implies for non-verbal forms of art. Fourth, we examine the implications and explanatory powers of Habermas's three-world distinction, which is, in turn, derived from the modernist presupposition of the distinction between subject and object. With these distinctions, we can see that the existence of a highly specialized field of expertise surrounding art and notions such as \"art for art's sake\" are not accidental. To conclude, we examine emotional life and its implications for modern notions of art.",

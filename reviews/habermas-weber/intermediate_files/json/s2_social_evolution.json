This paper seeks to simplify some of the theoretical concepts of revolutions, the major approaches are the classical phase, Karl Marx, Tocqueville, and Max Weber, while challenges of modernization theorists are Huntington and Tilly. This paper formulize the evolution in these concepts from one era to another. In addition, it explained the reasons for the revolutions, as well as explaining the role of the actors, and trying to clarify the reasons that led to the diversity of theories such as structural Analysis by Theda Skocpol and Ellen Kay Trimberger. Furthermore, it is notable that the development of concepts of theoretical analysis depends on the key aspects, and on the focus in analyzing the role of different actors, as well as on linking the different roles of these actors and the reasons for the revolution. Of course, there are still many theories that attempt to explain the revolution and make it a social phenomenon linked to scientific and objective reasons.",

With global economic modernization, technological innovation and institutional innovation have become critical for economic development, with design innovation gaining attention as a bridge connecting the two. By analyzing literature from the Web of Science and CNKI databases, the paper defines relevant concepts and reveals differences in the temporal distribution, hot topics, and research trends between Chinese and international studies. The study finds that international research started early and remains active, while domestic research has rapidly developed under the \"mass entrepreneurship and innovation\" initiative. Domestic scholars primarily focus on the theoretical exploration and application of ecosystems and innovation ecosystems, whereas international scholars emphasize the application of theoretical frameworks, policy formulation, and social innovation from the perspective of design studies. Design innovation is crucial in promoting collaboration among innovation entities, optimizing resource allocation, driving service innovation, and improving the innovation environment. This paper summarizes the current state of research both domestically and internationally, highlighting the importance of design innovation for future studies and providing valuable references and insights for scholars in related fields.",

The notion of modern social systems or institutions as structures of impartial, neutral, formal and impersonal proceduralism with a technical-logical or instrumental sense, constitution and evolution implies their non-political and non-normative understanding, depoliticizing them. As a consequence, institutions (especially political and economic ones) become self-referential and self-subsisting structures-subjects which are centralized and managed by institutional elites and technicians from a technical-logical standpoint-dynamics. We argue that a model of radical political democracy must overcome such separation between cultural modernity and social-economic modernization, politicizing the social systems and making them normative-political institutions-subjects streamlined and defined by social struggles between conflicting social classes, their hegemony and counterpoints.",

This work aims to describe the historical framework of wind energy until the inclusion of offshore wind farms in northeastern Brazil, from the economic, environmental and legal regulatory perspectives established from the 2000s. Materials and Methods:\u00a0 This study has a qualitative, theoretical, and descriptive character, as it is a bibliographical and documentary research, through the WEB of Science and Google system, where documents, articles and decision-making and statistical reports on this subject were collected as material, following detailed criteria through a detailed flowchart. In this job. Results: As a result, a detailed view of the investigated topic was obtained, which recorded political aspects, from the evolution of the regulation from 2020 to the present day; to the gaps that still exist in the offshore matrix in relation to economic and environmental aspect such as identified factors that permeate behavior and influence the distribution of access to this energy source. Conclusion: Worldwide, the offshore matrix has increased energy security and reduced dependence on thermoelectric and hydroelectric energy. However, parallel to the advancement of this renewable matrix, more research and investment should occur, given the difference in climatic conditions that modify the useful life and maintenance of parks. What differs from what happens in Brazil are the more favorable weather and wind conditions. Disadvantages with vibrations and electromagnetic fields, as well as high maintenance costs are challenges in producing this energy. Development in the national context was also a conclusive aspect in this research in order to lead to suggestions for the problem of blackouts that occur in the country, mainly with regard to planning, modernization, expansion and optimization of energy supply in order to increase efficiency. energy and meet national needs and prerogatives of environmental sustainability.\u00a0\u00a0",

The influence of personal interest, not limited by the framework of sociocentric morality, on the development of negative trends in the surrounding natural environment, the growth of social contrasts, the formation of a shadow economy, the spread of corruption, the increase of transaction costs, the inhibition of modernization processes in the field of production of goods, the accumulation of complications in the provision of quality services, etc. An analysis of the problems and threats caused by the stimulation of personal interest without its simultaneous subordination to public interests and coordination with them was carried out. It has been revealed how personal interest, unlimited by ethical norms, becomes the cause of the development of negative trends at the current stage of the evolution of the consumer economy, under the influence of both the stimulation of artificial needs of ordinary citizens at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid, and the growth of the scale of quasieconomic activities of leaders in the accumulation of capitalist resources at its top. The role of sociometric morality, corporate ethics, and solidarity between people in increasing the effectiveness of the organization of subjects of economic activity of various forms of ownership, scale of activity, and level of capitalization is revealed. It was established that legal regulators alone are not enough to ensure a high level of organizational efficiency of the economy, since all the nuances in the complex web of a large number of economic interactions cannot be taken into account in the current laws, for which certain \u00abblind spots\u00bb always remain, in which there is room for manipulation. Along with this, it was analyzed how due to \u00abblind spots\u00bb not taken into account in the laws, a favorable environment is formed for the development of corruption and imitation activities in the economy, in which the redistribution of income, resources, property, capital, etc. replaces the production of necessary goods and the multiplication of real capital at the disposal of society. The role of social norms, which are formed on the basis of dominant values, in constructing the quality of the environment in which the economy functions, receiving from it, depending on its properties, either impulses for its development, or inertial paralysis caused by the dominance of redistribution over progress, is revealed. It has been established that the economic paradigm has changed from the focus on multiplying productive capital to consumer priorities, rent, and power acquired through accumulated signs of wealth (money and securities), which step by step lose the ability to adequately reflect economic reality.",

      "abstract": "Rural settlements serve as the fundamental spatial unit in rural geography research and play a significant role in regional system research on human\u2012land relations. With the accelerated advances in urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural modernization, the flow of urban and rural development factors has greatly changed the social and economic forms of rural areas, further seriously restricting the sustainable development of rural economies and societies. The spatial patterns of rural settlements serve as tangible reflections of rural living and the evolution of settlement structures, directly influencing the sustainable development of rural areas and the construction of rural human settlements. Despite the increasing number of relevant studies, a comprehensive review of the field\u2019s dynamic evolution, research frontiers, and future development trajectories remains incomplete. On the basis of the Web of Science core database, this study used CiteSpace 6.2 R4 and VOS Viewer 1.6 software to perform a full systematic review of the literature on rural settlement spatial morphology from 2000 to 2024. The goal was to determine the current state of the research, where researchers are most active, and what major ideas and trends can be expected in the field of rural settlement spatial patterns. The results indicate that (1) the spatial patterns of rural settlements are a popular topic, integrating different disciplines and covering various themes, with close regional cooperation and a growing number of publications. At the national level, China, the United States, and France lead in research output and influence in this field. (2) The main research hotspots in the field include rural residential areas, spatial organization, land use, driving mechanisms, and regional systems, all of which are related to rural sustainable development. (3) Future research trends will likely focus on the response of rural settlement spatial patterns to new urbanization processes and social contexts. The findings provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of research hotspots, aiding researchers in related fields in quickly grasping the research frontiers and summaries.",

This book builds on the author\u2019s previous work concerning modernization as a multifaceted process of social change pivoting on value change, that is transformational in its impact and progressive in its effects. Inglehart\u2019s work builds on, but substantially revises, classical modernization theory as developed by Marx, Weber, Durkheim and many others, updating it to examine post-modern society and beyond, inquiring into the trajectory of the knowledge society and the Artificial Intelligence era. In this book, Inglehart applies the principles of evolutionary theory to develop a new theoretical framework for modernization theory. Evolutionary theory and functionalism shaped modernization theory as early as in the 60s, emphasizing the ability to adapt to gradual, continuous change as the normal condition of stability, by attributing causal priority to immanent sources of changes, and by analyzing social change as a directional process.

      "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that the contemporary era of digitalization significantly transforms the traditional bureaucratic model of public administration, which has been historically based on hierarchy, rigid procedures, and formalized document circulation. The article substantiates that under the conditions of globalization and wartime challenges, Ukraine requires more flexible, transparent, and technologically innovative governance mechanisms capable of combining legal stability with adaptability to the demands of the information society.\nIt has been revealed that the theoretical and methodological foundations of bureaucracy research rest upon the synthesis of Max Weber\u2019s concept of rational-legal bureaucracy, rational choice theory, the principles of New Public Management, the concept of good governance, and neo-institutionalism. This interdisciplinary framework enables the explanation of the mechanisms of bureaucratic evolution, the identification of its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the determination of the potential for integrating the traditional hierarchical model with innovative network and digital practices.\nIt has been identified that the key challenges of bureaucratic digitalization include issues of efficiency, transparency, information security, and democratic accountability. The author analyzes Ukraine\u2019s experience in implementing e-governance initiatives such as State in a Smartphone, State and Me, and the Prozorro e-procurement system, which contribute to minimizing corruption risks and expanding civic participation, but simultaneously entail dangers of formal openness, digital inequality, and increased dependence on vulnerable infrastructure, particularly under conditions of war.\nIt has been substantiated that the prospects for bureaucratic reform lie in combining technological innovations with the principles of democratization, social inclusion, and the rule of law. It is proposed to develop digital competences among public servants, implement mechanisms of cybersecurity and digital resilience, improve human resource policies, and ensure the integration of Ukrainian administrative practices into the European digital space.\nIn conclusion, it has been proven that the transformation of bureaucratic institutions in the era of digitalization is a key prerequisite for the modernization of public administration, strengthening its efficiency, transparency, and accountability, as well as for shaping an innovative and inclusive model of governance capable of responding to the strategic challenges of war and post-war reconstruction in Ukraine.",

This study explores the potential of web and immersive technologies, specifically the Virtual Romania (VRRO) platform, in enhancing sustainable tourism by redirecting tourist traffic to lesser-known destinations and boosting user engagement through interactive experiences. Our research examines how virtual tourism platforms (VTPs), which include web-based and immersive technologies, support sustainable tourism, complement physical visits, influence user engagement, and foster community building through social features and user-generated content (UGC). An empirical analysis of the VRRO platform reveals high user engagement levels, attributed to its intuitive design and interactive features, regardless of the users\u2019 technological familiarity. Our findings also highlight the necessity for ongoing enhancements to maintain user satisfaction. In conclusion, VRRO demonstrates how accessible and innovative technologies in tourism can modernize travel experiences and contribute to the evolution of the broader tourism ecosystem by supporting sustainable practices and fostering community engagement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The evolution of port operations into fifth-generation systems highlights a commitment to sustainability, digitalization, and community integration. However, challenges remain in balancing economic efficiency and environmental and social impacts. In-depth case studies of eight significant international ports are combined with bibliometric analysis to investigate the transformative model of Fifth-Generation Ports (5GPs). The study identifies three interrelated pillars-digitalization, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic integration-that build upon the development of port systems. The 5GPs framework is empirically supported by a bibliometric analysis of 410 Web of Science articles published between 2014 and 2025, which identifies intellectual clusters focused on smart port systems, energy transition, and governance. Uneven progress across the pillars is demonstrated by case studies of Shanghai, Singapore, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Los Angeles, Hamburg, Busan, and Long Beach. With automation and smart systems enhancing productivity and global competitiveness, digitalization emerges as the most advanced dimension. As demonstrated by Rotterdam\u2019s emission reductions compared to those of Hamburg and Los Angeles, which have faced persistent challenges, environmental sustainability exhibits quantifiable but uneven gains. The gap between port expansion and regional employment or demographic trends demonstrates that socioeconomic integration remains a frequently overlooked issue. These results demonstrate that simply evaluating efficiency metrics is insufficient to measure the competitiveness of port modernization; a balance must be struck between ecological responsibility and community well-being. The 5GP framework provides policymakers and port authorities with a well-organized roadmap. While highlighting the risks and best practices involved, this study acknowledges limitations in scope and highlights the need for further regional and longitudinal research. Ultimately, the transition to the 5GP signals a significant shift in maritime governance, with ports becoming hubs for resilient, inclusive, and sustainable urban development.",

These scholars predicted multiple problems of modernity; therefore, reference to their theoretical heritage is valuable in the search of new legal understanding, the need for which has existed for a long time. The scientific novelty consists in the analysis of views of the leading theoreticians who dealt with the correlation between law and social sciences. Social in the social sciences was often considered from the perspective of evolution of human relations. The essence of the social was revealed in various types of cohesion of population or connectedness between the members of social groups. In such relations, an important element was morality, which emerged much earlier than law. Morality emerged with the conception of the social, while law \u2013 only with the advent of the state. The classical social theories of the late XIX \u2013 early XX centuries, identified the concept of \u201csociety\u201d mostly with the politically organized and territorially restricted society of the modern Western national state.",

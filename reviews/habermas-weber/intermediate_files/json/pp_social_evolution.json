        "At a time when ideas of crisis and critique are at the forefront of public discourse, this article seeks to understand moments of crisis vis-\u00e0-vis critique as a key feature of critical social theory. It addresses J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s strong claim that this relationship accounts for a \u2018model of analysis\u2019 concerned with grasping the \u2018diremptions\u2019 of social life.",
        "A developmental logic: Habermas's theory of social evolution.Keunchang Oh - 2024 - Theoria 90 (1):81-97.",
        "To elaborate this reading, the article pays attention to the main problems Habermas identifies in conventional ways of understanding the concepts of \u2018crisis\u2019 and \u2018critique\u2019 in social theory. The aim is to examine the mode in which he reconsiders each of these terms and then reasserts the dialectical link between them.",
        "I reconstruct this relationship by taking as cases two of his most substantive works of social theorizing: The Theory of Communicative Action, and Between Facts and Norms. Based on this interpretation, I suggest that though Habermas contributes to resituating the practice of critique as a communicative translation of objective crisis, he does not adequately account for another key movement: when critique actually initiates, enacts and furthers the moment of crisis."

      "abstract": "Indonesia is a country whose government system is run with a democratic system. Pancasila, \u200ewhich is the foundation of the state, contains the principle of democracy. The main principle of \u200ethe Pancasila-style democracy is deliberation to reach a consensus based on noble knowledge \u200eand wisdom. This principle of deliberation is in line with Habermas's thesis of communicative \u200eaction but also has different implications. This paper compares the concept of deliberation-\u200econsensus ala Pancasila and Habermas's communicative action in implementing a democratic \u200esystem. This qualitative research analyzes data that includes historical literature, philosophy, and \u200escientific articles that discuss discourses related to Pancasila and Habermas's theory of \u200ecommunicative action. The study results show differences in Eastern and Western culture in the \u200etwo discourses. In Pancasila deliberation and consensus, communal ties are very strong, while \u200ethe value of Western individualism in rationalizing a discourse becomes the color of Habermas' \u200etheory.\u200e",

      "abstract": "More than forty years ago, J. Habermas published his two-volume Theory of Communicative Action in German, encapsulating over twenty years of reflection and research. The core concept of his intellectual pursuits was that the indestructible element of semantic rationality is rooted in the social form of communicative action, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive social theory, safeguarded through modern philosophy of language and science. In this book, as in his other works, J. Habermas intertwines an in-depth examination of theoretical traditions with his systematic argumentation, encompassing a wide range of scientific approaches. Reinterpreted theories from G. Mead, M. Weber, E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, and various versions of Marxism provided a system of conceptual coordinates within which J. Habermas recognized new ideas in social theory and tested those using factual arguments. After the book\u2019s publication, it garnered significant attention from the scientific community, which was remarkable considering the challenges it posed to readers. The initial published responses reflected its thematic complexity and ideological richness; the most common criticism, often expressed with the irony of a \u201chopelessly idealistic enterprise\u201d, was later refuted after deeper discussions. This criticism has persisted and is now supplemented with new arguments, which are countered by other counterarguments. Theory of Communicative Action has been translated into English, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has become the focal point of international discussions about social science theory. Few authors possess the argumentative skill, intellectual history knowledge, thematic breadth, and desire to diagnose the modern world required to address a variety of areas and answer pertinent questions. Those who do not participate in today\u2019s debates or have nothing to say about this influential social theorist effectively exclude themselves from being considered serious connoisseurs. The Russian edition of J. Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, translated by A. K. Sudakov and published by \u201cVes mir\u201d in 2022, was highly anticipated. However, disappointment soon followed when readers discovered the released version. Although the book\u2019s table of contents appears to align with the English translation by T. McCarthy (praised by both the global sociological community and J. Habermas himself), a closer examination of the Russian text reveals that it primarily consists of \u201csimulacra\u201d (semblances) of the original translation. According to J. Baudrillard\u2019s precise definition of \u201csimulacrum,\u201d this means it is merely an \u201cimitation of the non-existent\u201d and gives the impression of something that isn\u2019t truly there. The primary issue is that translator A. K. Sudakov disrupted the key semantic context by replacing the fundamental term \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (\u201chandeln,\u201d or \u201caction\u201d in the English translation) with the unrelated term \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u201ct\u00e4tigkeiten,\u201d \u201cactivity\u201d). From a modern sociological theory perspective, using the term \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (communicative activity) instead of \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (communicative action) is a significant violation of the logical progression and development of initial premises. Habermas formulated his concept of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d based on T. Parsons\u2019 approach to defining \u201caction\u201d as a singular social act, while the category of \u201cactivity\u201d is rooted in an extremely broad definition of \u201chuman activity\u201d. This article examines numerous glaring errors and distortions in the translations that not only affect the semantic structures of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d but also the entirety of modern sociology. As a result, the review is titled \u201cSimulacra of Translation\u201d to highlight these issues through various examples of factual \u201creinterpretations\u201d of the book\u2019s key meanings and concepts.",

      "abstract": "This study refers to how the Pela concept within the Maluku. This study relates to how the Pela concept within the Maluku community has a broad influence on the rationalization of the life-world. Modernity, liberalism, and the currents of globalization that fuel technical progress can jeopardize the rationalization of our life-world, which is essential for the integrity and solidarity of society, but neglect of technological progress should not be a proposition. Therefore, researchers, with the help of the dialectic of Habermas and Hardiman\u2019s thoughts with their post-secular thoughts, found a motive to examine how Indonesian multiculturalism has the potential to rationalize the development of society. Using the perspective of Jurgen Habermas and Hardiman based on post-secular theory, the purpose of this study helped researchers study the forms of deliberation from the Pela system. Qualitative research is the research method used. The critical paradigm is the chosen solution. This study combines Pela concepts associated with Habermas and Hardiman\u2019s post-secular thinking and uses Habermas\u2019 critical hermeneutic theory. The results of this study show the decision-making process. In this context, the researchers found the Pela concept as the initial capital of the Maluku people to support technical progress without neglecting the roots of solidarity. This research can be a reference for further researchers in sociology, ethnology, and even human resource management.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to examine the concept of pseudo-activity as formulated by Theodor W. Adorno, establishing a dialogue with the proposal of the end of the labor society, offering a reflection in light of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s perspective. Both thinkers are associated with the critical tradition of the Frankfurt School, although they present different approaches regarding the implications of modernity for work, culture, and the public sphere. Adorno criticizes rationalization and mass culture, considering them instruments of dehumanization in social and labor interactions. This dynamic generates practices that, although seemingly emancipatory, in fact perpetuate the logic of the system. In this context, pseudo-activity emerges as a form of simulated action, disconnected from any real transformation of social structures. Habermas, for his part, although heir to Adornian criticism, redirects the focus of analysis to communicative rationality, highlighting the relevance of public discourse and democratic deliberation. His view of the post-industrial society or a collapsing labor society provides a theoretical basis for understanding current changes in the role of labor and the emergence of fragmented issues. Based on this theoretical articulation, the article analyzes the consequences of the replacement of socioeconomic agendas by identity-based issues in the public domain, especially from the 1990s onward, influenced by neoliberalism and the technological revolution.",

The School's primary objective is to philosophically analyze and critique the social pathologies and contradictions engendered by modern capitalist societies. Influenced by philosophers like Kant, Hegel, and Marx, as well as psychoanalysis and Weberian rationalization debates, the School addressed historical context, capitalism's cultural forms, and new types of social subjectivity. The article traces the evolution from the first generation's critique of modernity and domination (Horkheimer, Adorno), through the innovations of the second generation with Habermas's theory of communicative action, to the contributions of the third generation, particularly Axel Honneth's theory of recognition. It highlights Honneth's effort to center the struggle for recognition within Critical Theory\u2014addressing the perceived shortcomings of previous generations (especially the pessimism of the first generation and the moral experiences overlooked by Habermas's theory)\u2014and provide a new normative foundation. The theory of recognition reveals the moral dimensions underlying social conflicts and emancipatory struggles, emphasizing the importance of intersubjective relations.",

Theorists of recognition have acknowledged the ways in which recognition relations make us vulnerable to others but have largely neglected the underlying \u2018webs of trust\u2019 in which such relations are embedded. In this paper, I consider the ways in which the theories of recognition developed by J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Axel Honneth, not only point to our mutual vulnerability but also implicitly rely upon mutual relations of trust. The paper first offers a novel examination of the relation between recognition, vulnerability and trust in Habermas\u2019 account of communicative action with the aim of arguing that such a consideration helps to elucidate important features of recognition. My claim is that a consideration of the dynamics of recognition and vulnerability in language-use, leads to an acknowledgment of the forms of trust that not only underpin communicative action, but recognition more generally. I conclude by considering the elements that are underplayed in Habermas\u2019 account by turning to an examination of Axel Honneth\u2019s alternative affective theory of recognition, specifically considering the interrelation between vulnerability and recognition. In doing so, I also turn to a consideration of the kind of trust that must be assumed in Honneth\u2019s account of mutual recognition and point to a recognitive notion of trust.",

Patients\u2019 organizations represent an important link between individual patients and the health system. Social theories are increasingly being used to explain doctor\u2013patient\u2013system interactions, expanding understanding beyond the mere clinical perspective. In this sense, patient involvement in HTA can also be considered through the Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action. From a Habermasian perspective, HTA as part of the instrumental rationality contributes to an increased efficiency of resource use within the system; however, such rationalization threatens to colonize the lifeworld by making it \u201cincreasingly state administered with attenuated possibilities for communicative action as a result of the commercialization and rationalization in terms of immediate returns.\u201d Using Habermasian system/lifeworld framework, this paper explores opportunities and obstacles to patient involvement in HTA, whereby trying to understand current and possible roles of patients\u2019 organizations as a mediating force between HTA as a function of the system and the lifeworld represented by patients.",

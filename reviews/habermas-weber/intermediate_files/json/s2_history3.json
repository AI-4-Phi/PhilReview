      "abstract": "Philosopher Carl Friedrich Gethmann, a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy, has described rationalization as the \u201ctargeted, structured and reproducible operation of optimization.\u201d1 Gethmann\u2019s broad definition covers rationalization across a range of very different areas \u2013 in the economy, in society, even in the mind of the individual. In our own field of religious studies, the first scholar who comes to mind in this context is the philosopher and sociologist Max Weber, who introduced the term \u201crationalization\u201d to the field.2 Maintaining that religious rationalization preceded social rationalization, Weber identified rationalization structures within the Judeo-Christian tradition that, as Gethmann puts it, \u201cencouraged the establishment of rational conceptions of the world and the emergence of a modern consciousness.\u201d3 In his studies of the \u201ceconomic ethics of the world religions,\u201d Weber developed the notion of a universal historical process of \u201cdisenchantment\u201d (Entzauberung4) of the religious-metaphysical conceptions of the world and argued for a \u201cunidirectional rationalization of all world religions.\u201d According to Weber, all paths of religious rationalization lead towards an understanding of the world that is purified of magical notions. Only the occidental path of development, however, leads to a fully decentralized understanding of the world.5 It is not my intention, at this juncture, to provide a full recapitulation of Weber\u2019s view of the rationalization that is inherent in all world religions. His basic assumptions concerning an occidental rationalism, and thus a particularly marked rationalism in the occidental religions, which he set against the Orient and its religions,6 appear highly problematic to us today. In view of the obvious problems in Weber\u2019s conceptualization, I believe it makes more sense, in talking about \u201crationalization in religions,\u201d to stick with Gethmann\u2019s definition of rationalization and to speak of an optimization of the \u201crationality\u201d of religion. But what is rationality? I turn again to Gethmann, who defines \u201crationality\u201d as \u201cdeveloping processes for the discursive upholding of claims to validity, to follow these and to",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "authors": [],
      "year": 2024,
      "abstract": "\n The year 2020 marked the centennial of the death of Max Weber, the German sociologist, scholar of world religions, economic historian, social philosopher, and theoretician of modern political life. This volume presents a collection of essays on the legacy and relevance of his thought. The authors, an international array of distinguished scholars, are drawn from various disciplines\u2014philosophy, political science, intellectual history, and sociology. They comprise both experts who have contributed to the ongoing study of Weber\u2019s oeuvre and theorists who discern his enduring bond with key problems in the humanities and social sciences. Max Weber at 100 seeks to understand the ways that Weber\u2019s legacy may take shape in the century to come. It contends that Weber\u2019s sustained relevance will derive not only\u2014and perhaps not even predominantly\u2014from his empirical claims, such as the \u201cWeber thesis\u201d about the origins of capitalism. Two key dimensions of his thought will play an increasingly important role in determining his significance: his inchoate but equally evocative theories about ecology, global capitalism, imperialism, democracy, and gender; and his broader, nonempirical or even philosophical observations concerning questions of human nature, value freedom, objectivity, secularization, rationalization, and disenchantment. The contributors cast a critical eye over Weber\u2019s oeuvre to ask what can still be learned from his work, and how his legacy might be contested or transformed.",

First Adair-Toteff summarizes the general meaning concerning the rationalization in the concept of Weber by reflecting critically on the most important authors. Secondly, Hans Joas followed historically the genealogy and the inherent dynamic of the term and idea of \u201eEntzauberung\u201d (disenchantment). He focuses on the central question of sociology of religion, whether it is possible to describe and analyze the role of religion in modern societies by employing the Weberian concepts of disenchantment and rationalization. Thirdly and lastly, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, similarly to Jonas, offers an alternative understanding of the linear process of secularization and rationalization. We hope that through the examination of the three different receptions have contributed to the contemporary discourse concerning Weber\u2019s theory of religion in Hungary.",

With this intention, the starting point will be the occidental rationalization to demonstrate that even taking distinct paths to learn the theoretical assumptions of the modern world, the conclusion of both regarding society's fate cover asymmetry, above all with respect to the consequences of the process of religion's rationalization. We believe that this affinity subject is important because it can help comprehend the secularization problem and the meaning crisis in contemporaneity.Keywords: Rationalization, Modernity and Identity and Religion.Enviado: 08-10-2018 - Aprovado e publicado: 12-2018",

      "abstract": "The human being is a multi-faceted entity, and within the spiritual realm, two primary centers govern: the center of reason (\u02bfaql) and the center of love (\u02bfishq). Human beings possess the faculty of thought, which, through reason, discerns truth from falsehood in the domain of theoretical and epistemic inquiry and fulfills practical functions in the domain of action. Love, however, arises from the human inclination toward ultimate perfection. According to \u02bfAll\u0101mah \u1e6cab\u0101\u1e6dab\u0101\u02be\u012b, love constitutes an existential connection between the lover and the beloved, manifesting as an attraction between the perfect cause (\u02bfillat k\u0101milah) and the perfected effect (ma\u02bfl\u016bl mustakmil). Through \u1e25arakat al-jawhariyyah (substantial motion), humans ascend from the level of potential intellect (\u02bfaql hay\u016bl\u0101n\u012b) to the level of acquired intellect (\u02bfaql mustaf\u0101d), thereby attaining the boundless joy of Divine knowledge. \u1e62adr al-D\u012bn Q\u016bnaw\u012b identifies two aspects of reason: first, as a faculty of logical reasoning and deduction, and second, as an instrument for apprehending intuitive truths (\u1e25aq\u0101\u02beiq shuh\u016bdiyyah). While the former is prone to error in logical structures or deductive reasoning, the latter is neither constrained by limitation nor subject to error. Q\u016bnaw\u012b considers the human essence to be the qalb (heart), characterized by its intermediary (barzakhiyyah) and unitive (a\u1e25adiyyah jam\u02bfiyyah) nature, which allows it to apprehend all truths-universal and particular alike. The highest attainment of the intellect is \u02bfaql mustaf\u0101d (acquired intellect). Yet, through the heart\u2019s love, the human being transcends the realm of intellect and enters the Divine Presence (\u1e63uq\u02bf rabb\u016bb\u012b). When the heart receives truths from higher realms, it transforms ordinary intellect into sacred intellect (\u02bfaql quds\u012b). This sacred intellect, being an illuminated intellect (\u02bfaql munawwar), not only comprehends divine truths but also retains the ability to engage in logical and philosophical reasoning. \u02bfAll\u0101mah \u1e6cab\u0101\u1e6dab\u0101\u02be\u012b identifies three paths to the knowledge of God: sensory perception (\u1e25iss), rational intellect (\u02bfaql), and the innate or heartfelt path (\u1e6dar\u012bq qalb\u012b wa-fi\u1e6dr\u012b). The innate path corresponds to the human heart\u2019s natural inclination toward the Ultimate Source (mabda\u02be al-mab\u0101d\u012b). For \u02bfAll\u0101mah, shar\u012b\u02bfah (divine law), grounded in illuminated and sacred intellect as well as divine revelation, aligns with human nature (fi\u1e6drah) and facilitates human happiness through the harmonious integration of reason, love, and divine guidance. In Q\u016bnaw\u012b\u2019s thought, divine love (\u02bfishq il\u0101h\u012b) refers to the primordial divine longing resulting from the unity of the divine names (asm\u0101\u02be). This love signifies a metaphysical movement and inclination inherent to the divine names themselves, independent of external causation. Q\u016bnaw\u012b devoted significant effort to providing a rational framework for unveiling (kashf) and mystical intuition (shuh\u016bd), asserting that the limitations of reason in comparison to intuition do not signify its absolute inefficacy. He critiques reason confined to Aristotelian rationality (\u02bfaql mash\u0101\u02be\u012b), emphasizing its dependence on theoretical reasoning, its susceptibility to imagination (wahm), and its limitations when devoid of intuitive insight. Consequently, before reason is elevated to sacred intellect through the heart, it may find itself in conflict with certain stages of love.",

      "abstract": "Freedom Ethics and Religion in Kant This work examines the relationship between freedom, ethics, and religion within Kants philosophical system. The author, Ahmet U\u011furlu, emphasizes that approaching Kants critical philosophy solely through the lens of the first Critique prevents a full understanding of his thought as a whole. Therefore, the book focuses particularly on the connection between practical reason, Kants moral philosophy, and his philosophy of religion. For Kant, freedom is the necessary condition of the moral law and can be experienced within every individuals inner life. In this context, freedom opens a sphere not subject to the causality of natural laws and positions the human being as an autonomous agent. The book discusses in detail the link Kant establishes between the moral law and the concept of the highest good. According to Kant, neither God nor the immortality of the soul can be proven theoretically; however, they must be accepted as postulates of practical reason. Thus, the completion of morality\u2014that is, the realization of the highest good\u2014 necessitates religion. This approach finds its expression in the notion of the religion of pure reason. Unlike historical and institutional religions, the religion of pure reason is rational, universal, and stripped of anthropomorphic elements. The book also explores the differences between classical revealed religions and Kants religion of pure reason. While classical religions reduce goodness to obedience to Gods commands, Kants morality-centered conception of religion rests on the struggle of the free individual to align intentions with the moral law. This struggle is regarded not only as an individual duty but also as a social responsibility. U\u011furlu systematically analyzes the distinctive aspects of Kants understanding of religion that diverge from both classical theology and traditional religions, highlighting his contribution to modern philosophy of religion.

      "abstract": "The subject of this article is to reveal Nietzsche's philosophy, which interprets the individuality theme of the enlightenment process, which shifts from religious understandings to secular minds, with a different perspective from its contemporaries, and which is based on the individual's dominance over himself. The aim of the article is to establish a philosophical tradition that presents the critical analysis of the Enlightenment and modernity-oriented structures; By examining the Enlightenment critique on the basis of 'reason', Adorno, Horkheimer, and Habermas, one of the Critical Theorists, aims to reveal their positive and critical aspects of Nietzsche. A literature review was chosen as the method in the article. Nietzsche's individual-centered philosophy has been examined in terms of the morality of ressentiment, will to power, superhuman, perspectivism, and eternal return teachings, and has revived the individual thought by preparing the ground for a postmodern exit against the risk of modernism to destroy subjectivity. Nietzsche's aim is to put basic value forms into life and to give a positive meaning to them through questioning the line of causality. For this purpose, it is to continue to follow with its discourses on art, aesthetics, and myth. However, while doing this, he was dragged into a journey claiming the opposite of his own philosophy with a perspective that loved his destiny and accepted his fate, and his path to myth and art remained as an unfinished project for the pains of the modern World.",

      "abstract": "Habermas\u2019s Public Sphere: A Critique analyzes the evolution of Juergen Habermas\u2019s social and political theory from the 1950s to the present by focusing on the explicit and on the tacit changes in his thinking about The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, his global academic bestseller, which has been translated into 30 languages. Integrating \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d \u201cdiscourse,\u201d and \u201creason,\u201d the three categories at the center of his lifelong work as a scholar and as a public intellectual, Habermas\u2019s classic public sphere concept has deeply influenced an unusually high number of disciplines in the social sciences and in the humanities. In the process, its complex methodology, whose sources are not always identified, can be perplexing and therefore lead to misunderstandings. \n While Habermas\u2019s \u201cFurther Reflections on the Public Sphere\u201d (1992) contain several far-reaching clarifications, they still do not identify a number of the most important sources for his methodology, above all Herbert Marcuse and Ernst Bloch. Hence, a key purpose of this study is to thoroughly analyze the Marxist critique of ideology that Habermas uses in dialectical fashion for his theory reconstruction of Immanuel Kant\u2019s liberal ideal of a rational-critical public as the organizational principle of the constitutional state and as the method of Enlightenment. Such dialectical thinking allows him to appropriate the structure of Reinhart Koselleck\u2019s Critique and Crisis and of Carl Schmitt\u2019s writings on the modern state while simultaneously upending their conservative critique of Liberalism and of the Enlightenment. However, this strategy restricts the application of his concept to his stylizations of the French Revolution and of his British \u201cmodel case.\u201d\n This critique reinvigorates Habermas\u2019s seminal distinction between the purely political polis of antiquity, which excludes the private economy from the res publica, and the modern public sphere with its rational-critical discourse about commodity exchange and social labor in the political economy. At the same time, it identifies the crises of seventeenth-century England and the Dutch Republic as the origins of the new channels of public communication used to constantly evaluate the role of state power as political facilitator and regulator of an increasingly complex, dynamic, and crisis-prone market economy.",

With pragmatism there are new forms of rationality, with emphasis on a type of reason that is formed in intersubjective relations. In Habermas, in particular, communicative reason promotes new conceptions about \"truth\" and \"knowledge\".

      "abstract": "Postmodernism is a counter-Enlightenment discourse against the subject-centered reason of the Enlightenment, i.e. the rationality based on \u2018the belief that there is objective truth and that appropriate methods of inquiry [employed by the autonomous subject] can bring us accurate and certain knowledge of that truth\u2019 (Crotty, 2003, p. 42). The subject is considered sovereign and capable of finding objective truth through \u2018scientific\u2019 methods. This subject-centered epistemological paradigm prevalent in the age of the Enlightenment is what postmodernism was critical of and deconstructed. While it is difficult to find an agreed-upon meaning of postmodernism, it is usually characterized as \u2018contingent, pluralistic, ambiguous, freed (or jettisoned) from the certainties of yesterday, decentered, [and] noisy with previously unheard voices\u2019 (Lincoln & Denzin, 2003, p. 632). The postmodernist thought is employed to challenge claims to absolutism and universalism. Therefore, the long-taken-for-granted authorities and metanarratives are called into question. Postmodernism is not without criticism. \u2018Ludic postmodernism,\u2019 for example, was coined by Ebert (1991) in her critique of the mode of postmodernism \u2018in which reality becomes a theater of simulation marked by the free play of images, disembodied signifiers, and the heterogeneity of differences (hence the term \u201cludic\u201d)\u2019 (p. 115). Elbert lamented the fact that ludic postmodernists of the American culture studies focus only on the \u2018play\u2019 of linguistic textuality and rhetoric while the historical and social reality is ignored. In the world of ludic postmodernism, real social inequalities are not taken to be \u2018real,\u2019 and thus analysis and research are no longer directed toward real changes to better society. In addition, postmodernism does not provide us with criteria to evaluate various discourses. Without criteria, how can we, for example, possibly tell the dominant from the oppressed? Doxc (2011) argues \u2018that by removing all criteria, we are left with nothing but the market. The opposite of what postmodernism originally intended\u2019 (para. 23). Although postmodernism deconstructed the subject-centered rationality, it did not offer a way out but succumbed to relativism. The question is: what role should the subject play in our search for knowledge? At this crossroads, Jurgen Habermas (1987) offers a direction, \u2018The paradigm of the philosophy of consciousness [or the philosophy of the subject] is exhausted. If this is so, the symptoms of exhaustion should dissolve with the transition to the paradigm of mutual understanding\u2019 (p. 296). Specifically, unlike a subject-centered rationality, Habermas\u2019s paradigm of mutual understanding, or theory of communicative action (TCA), steps beyond the scene of a lone, passive subject/observer and replaces it with that of two or more sentient beings communicating with each other. The subject in the dialogical paradigm is no longer a sovereign, authoritative figure, but an actor who communicates with other subjects and whose being as an actor requires other subjects and the internalization of other subject positions. TCA circumvents not only the impasse of the self-centered rationality of modernity but also the relativistic playfulness of postmodernism. Knowledge, relocated in TCA, is neither the grant narrative dictated by the dominant, nor the rhetoric of \u2018everything goes,\u2019 but subject to the contestation among actors/participants in a democratic setting.",

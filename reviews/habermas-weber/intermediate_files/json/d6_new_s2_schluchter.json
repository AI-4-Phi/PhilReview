      "abstract": "Despite its great popularity in both the scientific and non-scientific fields, Max Weber\u2019s concept of \u201cdisenchantment\u201d remains mostly obscure and in recent years it has become the center of an interdisciplinary debate on modernity involving both Weberian specialists and non-specialists. The aim of the article is to return to Weber\u2019s text and analyze Weber\u2019s use of the term and the meaning of what he calls the \u201cdisenchantment of the world.\u201d To do so I follow Taylor\u2019s and Schluchter\u2019s insight and investigate how Weber would picture an initial condition of enchantment. However, while these interpreters did not explore the Weberian perspective on magic, I instead show that not only Weber had a precise and original conception of magic as the primitive attitude toward the world, but also that this conception may clarify the meaning and dynamics of the process of disenchantment in both the spheres of religion and of science.",

Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:Until now, the ongoing debate on secularization has yielded no definite results. This is partly due to the multifaceted usage of the concept of secularization. Sometimes it is identified with disenchantment, a concept, introduced by Max Weber and applied in his comparative studies on religion since 1913. But Weber's usage is much broader than the concept of secularization suggests. Surprisingly, the concept of disenchantment is also appropriated by Charles Taylor in his seminal work A Secular Age. However, upon a closer look it turns out that his usage of the concept does not coincide with Weber's. In this article, I want to show in which regard the two authors join forces and in which they differ. The emphasis in the ensuing is on Max Weber, however, who attributed a more comprehensive meaning to the concept in distinguishing between religious and scientific disenchantment and in demonstrating, how these processes interacted historically and how they are related also to processes of reenchantment. However, in the final analysis both authors get together: Even in a secular age religion will not disappear, but the religious commitment has turned into an option, and insofar the religious situation has fundamentally changed in modernity.",

In this article, I examine the response given by one of democracy\u2019s leading intellectual architects, J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Whereas Weber thought that rational modernity enfeebles solidarity, Habermas believes that rational discourse itself inherits religion\u2019s moral-aesthetic power, a process that he calls the \u201clinguistification of the sacred.\u201d Habermas\u2019s stress on language, I argue, is partly justified. Yet as I show by tracing linguistification\u2019s roots to \u00c9mile Durkheim\u2019s sociology of religion and Walter Benjamin\u2019s theory of language, Habermas\u2019s program for solidarity falls short in one crucial respect. While shared discourse cultivates a basic interpersonal tolerance, it lacks the power to transport us beyond our narrow interests. Nonrational and prelinguistic aspects of our psychology remain decisive. Consequently, democratic solidarity in a secular age remains an unfinished project.",

      "abstract": "In this article I place Jurgen Habermas' recent turn to a \"post-secular society\" in the context of his previous defence of a \"postmetaphysical\" view of modernity. My argument is that the concept of \"postsecular\" introduces significant normative tensions for the formal and pragmatic view of reason defended by Habermas in previous work. In particular, the turn to a \"post-secular society\" threatens the evolutionary narrative that Habermas (following Weber) espoused in The Theory of Communicative Action (1981, 1987), The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity (1990) or Postmetaphysical Thinking (1992), according to which modern \"communicative\" reason dialecticlly supersedes religion. If this narrative is undermined, I argue, the claim to universality of \"communicative\" reason is also undermined. Thus, the benefits Habermas seeks to obtain from translation of religion are offset by a destabilization of tenets central to a \"postmetaphysical\" view of modernity.",

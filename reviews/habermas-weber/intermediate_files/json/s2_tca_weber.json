      "abstract": "More than forty years ago, J. Habermas published his two-volume Theory of Communicative Action in German, encapsulating over twenty years of reflection and research. The core concept of his intellectual pursuits was that the indestructible element of semantic rationality is rooted in the social form of communicative action, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive social theory, safeguarded through modern philosophy of language and science. In this book, as in his other works, J. Habermas intertwines an in-depth examination of theoretical traditions with his systematic argumentation, encompassing a wide range of scientific approaches. Reinterpreted theories from G. Mead, M. Weber, E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, and various versions of Marxism provided a system of conceptual coordinates within which J. Habermas recognized new ideas in social theory and tested those using factual arguments. After the book\u2019s publication, it garnered significant attention from the scientific community, which was remarkable considering the challenges it posed to readers. The initial published responses reflected its thematic complexity and ideological richness; the most common criticism, often expressed with the irony of a \u201chopelessly idealistic enterprise\u201d, was later refuted after deeper discussions. This criticism has persisted and is now supplemented with new arguments, which are countered by other counterarguments. Theory of Communicative Action has been translated into English, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has become the focal point of international discussions about social science theory. Few authors possess the argumentative skill, intellectual history knowledge, thematic breadth, and desire to diagnose the modern world required to address a variety of areas and answer pertinent questions. Those who do not participate in today\u2019s debates or have nothing to say about this influential social theorist effectively exclude themselves from being considered serious connoisseurs. The Russian edition of J. Habermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action, translated by A. K. Sudakov and published by \u201cVes mir\u201d in 2022, was highly anticipated. However, disappointment soon followed when readers discovered the released version. Although the book\u2019s table of contents appears to align with the English translation by T. McCarthy (praised by both the global sociological community and J. Habermas himself), a closer examination of the Russian text reveals that it primarily consists of \u201csimulacra\u201d (semblances) of the original translation. According to J. Baudrillard\u2019s precise definition of \u201csimulacrum,\u201d this means it is merely an \u201cimitation of the non-existent\u201d and gives the impression of something that isn\u2019t truly there. The primary issue is that translator A. K. Sudakov disrupted the key semantic context by replacing the fundamental term \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (\u201chandeln,\u201d or \u201caction\u201d in the English translation) with the unrelated term \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u201ct\u00e4tigkeiten,\u201d \u201cactivity\u201d). From a modern sociological theory perspective, using the term \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (communicative activity) instead of \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 (communicative action) is a significant violation of the logical progression and development of initial premises. Habermas formulated his concept of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d based on T. Parsons\u2019 approach to defining \u201caction\u201d as a singular social act, while the category of \u201cactivity\u201d is rooted in an extremely broad definition of \u201chuman activity\u201d. This article examines numerous glaring errors and distortions in the translations that not only affect the semantic structures of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d but also the entirety of modern sociology. As a result, the review is titled \u201cSimulacra of Translation\u201d to highlight these issues through various examples of factual \u201creinterpretations\u201d of the book\u2019s key meanings and concepts.",

      "abstract": "Associated with the Frankfurt School, Jurgen Habermas's work focuses on the modern foundations of social theory and epistemology, the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism and action theory. This paper sets out to explore the problems and possibilities of communicative action and the reconstruction of rationality which Habermas claims was lost in postmodern genre.",

      "abstract": "In this article I place Jurgen Habermas' recent turn to a \"post-secular society\" in the context of his previous defence of a \"postmetaphysical\" view of modernity. My argument is that the concept of \"postsecular\" introduces significant normative tensions for the formal and pragmatic view of reason defended by Habermas in previous work. In particular, the turn to a \"post-secular society\" threatens the evolutionary narrative that Habermas (following Weber) espoused in The Theory of Communicative Action (1981, 1987), The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity (1990) or Postmetaphysical Thinking (1992), according to which modern \"communicative\" reason dialecticlly supersedes religion. If this narrative is undermined, I argue, the claim to universality of \"communicative\" reason is also undermined. Thus, the benefits Habermas seeks to obtain from translation of religion are offset by a destabilization of tenets central to a \"postmetaphysical\" view of modernity.",

      "abstract": "The paper considers interaction of the theories of moral legitimation with the concepts of communicative action and negotiation in consideration of critique of classical ideals of rationality and Habermas\u2019s weak attitude of transcendental pragmatics. The aim of the paper is to show the importance of epistemological interpellation of moral legitimation and its procedures for contemporary ethics and development of other moral traditions. Ideas and conflicts of legitimation are analysed with regard to considerations of Weber, Arendt and Habermas. The paper supplements the theory of communicative action and discourse, as precondition of a normative, with the concepts of moral temporality, world event, and responsible action regarding contemporary post-structural philosophy. The main thesis of the paper is that, according to the critical theory, moral legitimation is supported by possible universal idea of communicative action, negotiation and sufficiency, which depend on the processes of multiplicities. The arguments of the paper aim at the critic of classical ideals of rationality, theories of ranks and sanctity, accumulation of symbolical capital and power of institutions. Needs of transcendental principle of communicative action, negotiation and temporality are argued for by examples of the development of civilizational and cultural diversity, growing significance of personal and group dynamics, and continuous origin of new conflicts. The article consistently rejects the idea of foundationalism and substitutes it with the notions of politics of sufficient legitimation, openness and group dynamics.",

      "abstract": "While appreciating the role of the Enlightenment Jurgen Habermas also understands the difficulties of its primacy of rationality. Inadequacy of instrumental interpretation of rationality leads the German philosopher to the formulation of the theory of communicative action. In this theory the search for an agreement becomes the basis for an action; this theory replaces and complements the conception of the action formulated by Max Weber. Moreover, it is the language and more specifically the whole process of communication that reveals complicated social reality. The importance of these theoretical considerations is shown in bioethical reflection, mainly in regard to the eugenics.",

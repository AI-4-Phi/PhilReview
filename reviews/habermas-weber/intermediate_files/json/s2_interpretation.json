      "abstract": "Reading Habermas: Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere dissolves Habermas\u2019s monolithic stylization to precisely access his seminal distinction between the purely political polis of antiquity, which excludes the private economy from the res publica, and the modern public sphere with its rational-critical discourse about commodity exchange and social labor in the political economy. Deconstructing the uniform mold of Structural Transformation\u2019s narrative about a rise and fall of the bourgeois public sphere in modernity also allows to identify and understand the ideology-critical methodologies of Habermas\u2019s theory reconstruction of Kant\u2019s ideal of the liberal public in the context of the French Revolution. \n Readers of this guide realize that Habermas\u2019s interpretation of a sociological and political category with the norms of constitutional theory and intellectual history causes the \u201ccollapsing of norm and description\u201d he acknowledged in 1989 and thus frequent misunderstandings about the historical validity of Structural Transformation\u2019s ideal-type derived from Condorcet\u2019s absolute rationalism and Kant\u2019s \u201cunofficial\u201d philosophy of history. Specifically, the guide explains that Habermas\u2019s key construct of a \u201cmorally pretentious rationality\u201d of the bourgeois public sphere entirely depends on the claim about \u201cnatural laws\u201d harmoniously regulating the economy. While neoliberalism still maintains this claim, Hegel \u201cdecisively destroyed\u201d it already in 1821.",

      "abstract": "Habermas\u2019s argument from human nature, which speaks in favour of holding back the use of human germline editing for purposes of enhancement, has lately received criticism anew. Prominent are objections to its supposedly genetic essentialist and determinist framework, which underestimates social impacts on human development. I argue that this criticism originates from an instrumentalist reading of Habermas\u2019s argument, which wrongly focuses on empirical conditions and means-ends-relations. Drawing on Habermas\u2019s distinction of a threefold use of practical reason, I show how an alternative\u2014the ethical\u2014reading avoids essentialist and determinist objections by addressing an existential level of sense making. I present three reasons that speak in favour of the ethical reading and I demonstrate how it incorporates social aspects of character formation. Habermas\u2019s account therefore offers exactly what the critics claim is missing. The paper concludes with a conceptual challenge that the ethical reading has to face within Habermas\u2019s overall approach to genetic engineering.",

Following a brief outline of Peirce\u2019s communicative conception of scientific inquiry, I analyze Habermas\u2019s theory in relation to the concept of communication, including his contextually significant critique of Hannah Arendt. Three functions of communication within Habermas\u2019s framework form the core of my approach, situating him in close proximity to the pragmatic philosophical tradition. In conclusion, I draw on Axel Honneth\u2019s reading of John Dewey\u2019s theory of democracy to underscore Habermas\u2019s relevance for contemporary discussions on pragmatism and democracy.",

I offer a reinterpretation of the thesis of colonisation of lifeworld in light of a specific reading of the critique of ideologies, trying to show that this thesis can be interpreted as a case of critique of ideologies. To do so, I firstly present a brief general map of the different forms of social critique present today in social philosophy by placing special emphasis on the critique of ideologies. Secondly, I briefly state Habermas\u2019 diagnosis on the colonisation of lifeworld by differentiating the two levels of critique which are, in my view, contained within the theory of communicative action: critique as the discursive redemption of validity claims by participants and critique as an observer\u2019s social diagnosis. Lastly, I confront these two levels of critique with the form of critique of ideologies analysed in the first point and conclude that we can refer to the second level as a case of a critique of ideologies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:\nContemporary Indian literature has become an important space for questioning the intricate web of belief, truth, and narrative construction in the post-truth world. The study explores critically the ways literary narratives engage with post-truth practices such as linguistic manipulation, pseudofactuality, fictiocracy, and reader incredulity to mirror and critique the epistemic uncertainty of contemporary Indian society. Through the calculated use of fractured narration, metafictional techniques, and allegorical criticism, these texts expose the processes by which truth is fabricated, disputed, and frequently militarized within dominant ideologies. Through a reading of influential works by Arundhati Roy, Amitav Ghosh, Geetanjali Shree, Perumal Murugan, Meena Kandasamy, and Samit Basu, this research examines how literature resists the epistemic erasure inherent in post-truth discourse, providing alternative forms of knowledge production that contest both historical revisionism and media-facilitated distortions.\nPositioning itself in the larger debate about narrative epistemology and post-truth politics, this research contends that literature is not simply a reflection of post-truth realities but an active agent that intervenes within them, serving as a location of epistemic resistance. Fictions like The Ministry of Utmost Happiness and Tomb of Sand subvert narrative stability to reveal the vulnerability of truth, whereas Poonachi and Exquisite Cadavers challenge fictiocratic hierarchies that control political and social realities. In addition, speculative and dystopian fictions like The Wall and Chosen Spirits foster an incredulous mode of reading, which forces the audience to scrutinize the artifice of \"truth\" both in fiction and reality. By applying textual analysis in conjunction with critical theory, the research brings into prominence the contributions of Indian literature to the predicaments of the post-truth era, shedding light on how narrative fictions of literature traverse the fault lines separating fact, fiction, and ideology.",

Lewis\u2019s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe through the theoretical framework of Rosi Braidotti\u2019s post-anthropocentric philosophy as articulated in The Posthuman (2013). Post-anthropocentrism is a critical stance that challenges the preference of the human subject as central to meaning, ethics, and knowledge, and instead situates the human as one among many interdependent life forms. Braidotti\u2019s framework dismantles Eurocentric humanism for its hierarchical structuring of species, bodies, and subjectivities by decentralizing the human as the measure of all things. Instead, she emphasizes on zoe (the impersonal, vital force animating all life), the nature-culture continuum (a non-binary integration of ecological and social realms), and relational subjectivity (identity constituted through multispecies networks). The Pevensie children\u2019s transformation from human-centric perspectives to relational ethics reflects post-anthropocentric models of negotiable identities. Through Braidotti\u2019s post-anthropocentric lens, Narnia emerges as a proto-posthuman space where nonhuman agency disrupts classical hierarchies. This study advances SDG 15 (Life on Land) by exposing how Narnia\u2019s zoe-centric ethics, where Aslan\u2019s thaw challenges ecological instrumentalization, demand a radical rethinking of protection beyond human stewardship. Through close textual analysis, this study departs from the traditional, theological and morally allegorical interpretation of Narnia and reframes it as a proto-posthuman ethical landscape wherein the human is not central, but embedded in a web of more-than-human forces.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers Habermas' model of a post-secular political order in the light of the debate on male circumcision that arose in Germany after a court ruled that male circumcision was an unjustifiable act of bodily harm. Central to this model is the idea that religious reasons can only become effective in central legal institutions when they are translated into secular reasons. My paper demonstrates that there are two distinguishable readings of this proviso. On the one hand, there is a broad reading according to which it is only necessary to reach a conclusion that is in line with the democratic principle stating that all citizens can be regarded as co-legislators even if non-generalizable value orientations might then shape the interpretation of fundamental rights (in the case of circumcision, the right to bodily integrity). On the other hand, a truly secular (narrow) reading would avoid the inclusion of non-generalizable value orientations. The debate on circumcision demonstrates that these two interpretations lead to different and conflicting modes of justification. The broad reading allows for a justification of male circumcision, whereas the narrow reading makes such a justification unlikely. In addition, the filtering function of the proviso is weakened in a broad reading.",

      "abstract": "Max Weber famously diagnosed both an excess and a subordination of meaning in modernity when he coined the term disenchantment next to the fragmentation and irreconcilability of value spheres. Unlike Weber, however, who sought to keep the ideological and the rationalist sides of the modern divide together, his immediate followers capitalized either on his decisionism (i.e. Carl Schmitt) or on his universalism (i.e. J\u00fcrgen Habermas). In an attempt to develop a constructive perspective on the question of how we can conceive of irreconcilable values within a larger normative horizon, this article introduces Karl Jaspers\u2019s interpretation and refinement of Weber\u2019s work. Most fundamentally, Jaspers\u2019s existentialist philosophy of communication sought to turn Weber\u2019s warring gods into a source of solidarity rather than divisiveness. I argue that Jaspers did so in rooting human freedom not in the decision or the law but in an experiential uncertainty and the knowledge not to know. The article closes with a discussion of some practical and theoretical implications of Jaspers\u2019s thought for our understanding of diversity in unity in post-truth times.",

We discuss the essential theoretical aspects of the work by Horkheimer (1975) \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory,\u201d and produce a critique on the use of generational chronology as the main criterion for understanding the intellectual movement of the Frankfurt School. The methodology is based on the critique of the interpretation using the philosophical hermeneutics (RICOEUR, 1990) and observes the propositional nature of an interpretation offered in theoretical essays (MENEGUETTI, 2011). To support the provocative proposition of this work, we establish a dialogue with authors such as Bottomore (2001), Freitag (2004), Nobre (2004), and Melo (2013)) discussing a non-generational characterization of the Frankfurt School\u2019s members and the proximity of Habermas in relation to the pioneer works on the Critical Theory. We believe that (i) the re-reading of the emancipatory purpose (HABERMAS, 2002); (ii) the deconstruction of the impartiality of the scientific knowledge (HABERMAS, 1987); (iii) and the incorporation of the philosophy of language into the Frankfurtian social criticism (HABERMAS, 2012) are important contributions of Habermas to the Frankfurt\u2019s critical theory. As for a proposal for the field of organizational studies, this esseay concludes that recognizing Habermas as a Critical Theory scholar of the Frankfurt School may constitute a new research agenda for the field. The contribution of this essay lies in helping researchers in the field of Organizational Studies to understand Habermas\u2019 work differently and not as a non-critical or utopian production. In this perspective, it is clear that Habermas\u2019 intellectual production is politically engaged in contemporary social problems, which is a dimension neglected by the researchers of the field of Organizational Studies in Brazil.",

The first section, after a schematic presentation of Rawls' political liberalism, offers an analytical discussion of the notions of \"reasonable\" and \"rational\" at the domestic level. The second section makes explicit the fundamental ambiguity contained in the concept of \"reasonable\", using in a paradigmatic way the opposite readings proposed by Richard Rorty and Jurgen Habermas (respectively, a contextualist-pragmatist and a Kantiano- universalist reading). Finally, the third section examines the development of the concept of \"reasonable\" at the international level, showing how the ambiguity inherent in this concept leads to tensions not adequately resolved by Rawls. At the same time, while highlighting the tensions paradigmatically represented by the opposite readings of Rorty and Habermas, the article concludes that the late Rawls project cannot be reduced to any of these opposite readings, and deserves to be developed in its peculiarity, starting from a reformulation of the concept of \"reasonable\".",

Weber\u2019s ideal-typical methodology is characterized as a mix of descriptive inaccuracy and causal adequacy. Based on some recent structuralist results in the philosophy of science it is highlighted how intimately causal understanding and the properties of entities are related. The main contrast between Weber and Friedman consists in the emphases they placed on the causal properties of agents. It is argued that Friedman\u2019s instrumentalism results from his neglect of entity properties for no causal understanding can be placed upon neglected characteristics. By identifying some channels through which methodological Weberianism could spread, the possibility of a real albeit indirect connection between Weber and Friedman is suggested, with Frank H.

At its centre lie enduring questions about tradition, critique, understanding and the ethical-political implications of interpretation.\nObjectives:\u00a0This article revisits and critically assesses the Gadamer\u2013Habermas debate by examining its theoretical stakes and ethical consequences. It clarifies how their contrasting positions on ontology, language, tradition and critique inform divergent approaches to moral and political reasoning.\nMethod:\u00a0A comparative philosophical reconstruction traces the intellectual trajectories of both thinkers, focusing on three key divergences: their ontological frameworks, the relation between tradition and reason and their differing readings of Aristotle. The analysis draws on primary texts and significant secondary interpretations.\nResults:\u00a0Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics affirms the formative role of tradition and the dialogical emergence of meaning through language, whereas Habermas insists on critical reflection to uncover power-laden distortions within tradition. Their approaches yield two ethical paradigms: one grounded in phronesis and historical sensibility and the other in rational deliberation and procedural norms.\nConclusion:\u00a0The debate raises a lasting question: should ethical and political life be guided by a critique of tradition or by a tradition of critique?\nContribution:\u00a0By offering a structured reappraisal of this exchange, the article contributes to ongoing discussions in ethics, political philosophy and hermeneutic theory and invites renewed reflection on the relevance of both critique and tradition in shaping just societies.",

Focusing on Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s intellectual identity, innovative linguistic strategies, and public discursive interventions, the study explores his effort to construct a dialogical bridge between the classical Hawza tradition and modern academic discourse. Drawing on Edward Said\u2019s notion of the \u201cuniversal intellectual,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action and the public sphere, Michel Foucault\u2019s distinction between knowledge and consciousness, and Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s concept of \u201cepistemic habitus,\u201d the article analyzes the discursive structure of Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s thought. \nAnother key focus of the article is the reception of Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s works in post-1980 Turkey. His translated texts, which circulated through magazines, publishing houses, and intellectual platforms, constituted not only a private reading practice but also a discursive intervention that contributed to the intellectual transformation of Turkish Islamism. Through indicators such as editorial strategies, the publication of articles in periodicals, and growing academic interest, the study investigates the influence of Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s ideas\u2014particularly among younger generations\u2014on regional formations of Islamic public reason. \nMethodologically, the article adopts a multilayered strategy combining qualitative discourse analysis with conceptual textual interpretation. Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s conceptual architecture, discursive patterns, and social critiques are examined through intertextual readings within the context of Islamic intellectual history. Special attention is given to key notions such as \u201cphilosophical insight\u201d (bas\u012brat), \u201cpublic reason,\u201d and \u201cintellectual responsibility.\u201d These analyses reveal not only the nature of Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s intellectual identity but also the dynamic interplay between discourse and its historical and social context. \nUltimately, the article conceptualizes Mutahhar\u012b\u2019s intellectual practice as a transnational form of public reason that resonates beyond Iran in both regional and interdisciplinary dimensions. His legacy is marked by an effort to transform traditional epistemic structures within the Hawza, combining epistemological reform with ethical critique. Thus, Mutahhar\u012b should be reevaluated as a critical, transformative, and participatory Islamic intellectual. From this perspective, the article calls for a renewed discussion on the role of public reason and intellectual representation within Islamic thought.",

Recent commentators have traced this debate either to Habermas\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s divergent views about the status of Western modernity or to their disagreement about the relation between the good and the right. I argue that these readings rest on misinterpretations of Habermas\u2019s theory of social evolution and understanding of impartial justification. I show that the debate rests on diverging interpretations of what it means for citizens to embed the principles of liberal democracy in their respective conceptions of the good. This difference in turn leads Habermas and Taylor to espouse different criteria of democratic legitimacy. I conclude by suggesting that we have prima facie reasons to prefer Habermas\u2019s conception of legitimacy to Taylor\u2019s, and to that extent, to favor his model of the public use of reason.",

Previous interpretations have mostly focused on epistemological and logical aspects of value interference in science, leaving the relationship between Weber\u2019s categories \u2013 and the mechanisms through which values shape scientific problem selection \u2013 underexplored. Drawing on the case of familial homicides, we argue that researchers integrate their values into the research process through a three-stage model. We trace the origins of Weber\u2019s concept of value interpretation to perspectivism and Nietzsche\u2019s notion of a \u201cbattle of values.\u201d By examining the historical development of the concepts of interest and value relevance \u2013 particularly in relation to Kant\u2019s theory of reason \u2013 we propose a revised reading of the epistemological foundations of Weber\u2019s approach. Finally, we analyze the methodological implications of personality, vocation, Bildung, and responsibility ethics in Weber\u2019s social theory, highlighting their significance for understanding how values are embedded in the selection and framing of scientific problems.",

Instead of conveying fixed meaning, they transmit ways of establishing and blocking allegory, a mode of signification that only emerges when meaning is in crisis.

Odradek disrupts the pages of theory from Benjamin and Adorno to Weber and Hamacher.

      "abstract": "The Militant Listener: Reading Mongane Wally Serote's Sikhahlel' u-OR alongside Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History In Sikhahlel' u-OR: A Praise Poem for Oliver Tambo, Mongane Wally Serote presents an unflinching yet delicate meandering through the questions, reflections and provocations resistance history offers up through O. R. Tambo's life. As Ciraj Rassool points out, in this work Tambo appears not as an individual, but as an integral node in a web connecting various lives.1 This counter-neoliberal interpretation of Tambo's life offers what Michael L\u00f6wy calls 'a heterodox form of the narrative of emancipation' rebuilding the struggle hero narrative along a decentred framework.2 By radically dislodging this narrative, Tambo is portrayed as the 'non-iconic icon' he was esteemed to embody, and in this move, the poem, notably, points to the dearth of dialectic politics, both in our quotidian praxis, and the commemoration of others.3 Aptly, Serote's work contributes to what Souleymane Bachir Diagne and Jean-Loup Amselle describe as a 'total decentring of all thought, one that rejects all \"centrisms\" and highlights instead branchings and connections, transfers, analogies and reciprocal influences between cultural places and intellectual fields that may be distant but are not distinct in space and time'.4 To this end, the poem presents us with a constellation of historical actors who flicker on the horizon, beckoning us to engage in the labour of freedom ('here we go again / the hour demands us to be daring once more / to emerge from a possible storm').",

      "abstract": "This review of Amy Allen\u2019s book, The End of Progress (2016), first addresses the structure of the book and focuses on specific points made in individual chapters, including the affinity between postcolonial theory and the approaches of Adorno and Foucault in subjecting the notion of historical progress to \u201cwithering critique,\u201d and Allen\u2019s alternative approach to decolonization; Habermas\u2019 aim to put critical theory on a secure normative footing; Honneth\u2019s stance that the history of an ethical sphere is an unplanned learning process kept in motion by a struggle for recognition; Forst\u2019s attempt to reconstruct Critical Theory\u2019s normative account through a return to Kant rather than Hegel; and Allen\u2019s claim that her approach is fully in the spirit of Critical Theory and could be seen as continuation of Critical Theory\u2019s first generation, as in Adorno, and how it is a \u201cgenealogical\u201d approach that draws on Adorno\u2019s negative dialectics and critique of identity thinking, as well as on Nietzsche\u2019s conception of genealogy, as developed by Foucault. The second part of my response raises three issues: (1) Allen\u2019s partial compromise with the idea of progress; (2) whether critical theory would profit from engagement with other critical theories and theories of ethics, beyond postcolonial theory; and (3) nonwestern theories shed a different light on the question of Allen\u2019s critique, a theme that also draws attention to the gesture of decolonizing, the distinctions between colonialism and empire, and the sociology of knowledge production.",

Regressive reactions to the crises of capitalism are currently reviving the debate about its relevance for the Frankfurt School.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper is a critical response to Amy Allen\u2019s The End of Progress: Decolonising the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory. We take up her book\u2019s call for a \u201cproblematizing\u201d history which challenges \u201ctaken-for-granted\u201d preconceptions in order to contest Allen\u2019s own representation of the thought of the enlightenment. Allen accepts that all the enlighteners agreed upon a stadial, progressive account of history, which she critiques epistemically and normatively (Part 1). But we show in Part 2, drawing on the work of Henri Vyverberg and other historians of eighteenth century ideas, that a cyclical, rise and fall account of historical succession was more prominent than the progressive narrative in leading enlighteners such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, D\u2019Alembert, Condillac, Jancourt, Grimm, and Raynal, all of whom Allen does not mention. In Part 3, we show that not all thinkers of the enlightenment were pro-colonial or pro-imperialist, as Allen also presupposes in The End of Progress. By examining Abb\u00e9 Raynal\u2019s History of The Two Indies in Part 3, and notably its Diderotian interpolations, we show that many enlighteners propounded fierce criticisms of European colonialism and the slave trade, even calling directly for armed resistance against European infractions. In critical theorists\u2019 search for chastened normative foundations, our concluding remarks contend, there is a need to develop more accurate, balanced, post-postmodern reckonings of the enlightenment.",

Then I turn to David Owen and Amy Allen's critiques of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. My aim is to develop their critique of Habermas by elucidating an important but neglected distinction between the developmental logic and the developmental dynamics in Habermas's theory of social evolution. Drawing on this distinction, I claim that Habermas's theory is problematic in that he underestimates the importance of the developmental dynamics. By introducing the distinction between individual learning and social learning, I also question\u00a0his account of progress as accumulative experience of learning. This is because, unlike cumulative culture at the level of phylogenesis, individuals ontogenetically experience a kind of non\u2010cumulative social learning. Unlike cumulative culture, each individual has to undergo a kind of non\u2010cumulative social learning. The problem is that Habermas conceives the learning process too narrowly such that learning does not guarantee social evolution.",

      "abstract": "This paper\u00a0deals with Amy Allen\u2019s critique of Habermas's theory of modernity, democracy, and cosmopolitanism. I will focus on her arguments that touch on the role of rationality. Allen's critique of Habermas will be presented, especially where she argues that focusing on rationality is ethnocentric and promotes the political exclusion of subaltern groups. The extent to which Allen's critiques affect the emancipatory potential of Habermasian theory will next be assessed. It is finally argued that Allen's position leads to a denial of the distinction between social rationality and irrationality as legitimate criteria. The consequences of such a position for the political sphere will then be analyzed.",

      "abstract": "To offer a compelling critique of the present, critical theory needs an account of capitalism that foregrounds its interrelation with the ongoing legacies of colonialism, imperialism, and slavery. To serve as a resource for such an account, Marx\u2019s critique of capitalism and his theory of history need to be disentangled. This analysis revisits the problems of universality, necessity, and progress in Marx\u2019s work in order to show how Marx\u2019s consistently dialectical and critical account of capitalist modernity can be emancipated from the historicist framework that undergirds it.",

      "abstract": "Philosophy as a discipline has generally claimed that human beings have a capacity called practical reason that allows us to address moral-practical questions. Applied to historical change, this yields an account of progress as a process of rationalization. The 20th\u00a0century has produced a long line of radical critiques of this idea of progress. My central aim is to defend contemporary critical theory\u2019s reliance on the idea of progress as an emancipatory process of rationalization. Because she engages deeply and directly with the accounts of progress I seek to defend, my focus is on Amy Allen\u2019s critique and an array of closely allied recent criticism. I address Allen\u2019s two general objections to progress as a fact, one political and the other epistemological. Against contemporary critical theory, I maintain, neither objection gains traction, since no truly emancipatory project can succeed once the idea of progress has been abandoned, both as a goal and a fact about our past.",

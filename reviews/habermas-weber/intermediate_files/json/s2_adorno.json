      "abstract": "Habermas\u2019 critical theory is partly an attempt to identify the limitations of critique and emancipation as espoused in the first generation critical theory of Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. In their attempt to develop an interdisciplinary, reflexive, emancipatory and dialectical reason that is critical towards accepted realities, Horkheimer and Adorno in their monumental work The Dialectic of Enlightenment pictured a world trapped in instrumental rationality. Taking and revolutionizing traditional critical theory, Habermas argues that reason entails both emancipator as well as instrumental possibilities. Through an exposition of Habermas\u2019 critique of Horkheimer and Adorno in his discourse of modernity, this article argues that although Habermas successfully identifies the equation of the rational with the instrumental and offers an emancipator model in return; still he ends up not paying sufficient attention to aesthetic truth.",

Then resume the reading of Habermas in The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity on a Nietzsche\u2019s radical critique to modern rationality, in order to examine two points: 1) What arguments support the thesis of inconsistency and lack of foundation of Nietzsche's genealogical critique? 2) why Habermas claims that the heirs of Nietzschean critique repeat this inconsistency, including the very critical of Adorno and Horkheimer? We intend to demonstrate, unlike Habermas, Adorno and Horkheimer in demythologization program of instrumental reason resume Nietzschean critical project aiming to build a new positive and demythologized meaning for enlightenment.",

      "abstract": "\n In the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel places the concept of utility at the centre of his analysis of the Enlightenment period. Utility does not appear merely as a criterion of individual action, but describes a social context of mutual support, realized in a collective referred to by Hegel as a \u2018troop\u2019 (Trupp). In Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s critique of a reason fixated on utility, the Hegelian image of the \u2018troop\u2019 came to symbolize a repressive equality which removes the freedom of the individual and seals the failure of enlightenment. In contrast, this article demonstrates that Hegel\u2019s concept of utility cannot be reduced to an attitude which instrumentalizes everything and everyone. In fact, utility refers to a mode of interaction which also takes account of the heterogeneity of each individual. Drawing on Hegel and going beyond his analysis, the article develops a post-Hegelian concept of utility as a formation of social practices that neither instrumentalizes people, nor simply represents an instantiation of social freedom, but rather establishes a constitutive relation between caring for oneself and being useful to others. From this perspective, the concept of utility is not only part of the problem of enlightenment, but also contributes to the endeavour to which Adorno and Horkheimer committed themselves: to work towards an affirmative understanding of enlightenment.",

      "abstract": "Dialectic of Enlightenment is, quite justifiably, one of the most celebrated and often cited works of modern social philosophy. It has been identified as the keystone of the 'Frankfurt School', of which Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer were the leading members, and does not cease to impress in its wide-ranging ambition and panache. Adorno and Horkheimer addressees themselves to a question which went to the very heart of the modern age, namely 'why mankind, instead of entering into a truly human condition, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism'. Modernity, far from redeeming the promises and hopes of the Enlightenment, had resulted in a stultification of mankind and an administered society, characterised by simulation and candy-floss entertainment. To seek an answer to the question of how such a condition could arise, Adorno and Horkheier subjected the whole history of Western catagories of reason and nature, from Homer to Nietzsche, to a searching philosophical and psychological critique. Drawing on psychoanalytical insights, their own work on the 'culture industry', deep knowledge of the key Enlightenment and anti-Enlightenment thinkers, as well as fascinating considerations on the relationship between reason and myth - the rational and the irrational - the authors exposed the domination and violence towards both nature and humanity that underpin the Enlightenment project.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:This essay suggests a reading of Dave Eggers's 2013 novel The Circle as a critique of modernity. It argues that Eggers's dystopian novel can be read as an artistic take on Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's philosophical critique of Enlightenment ideology, as put forward most prominently in their Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944/47). The puzzling tendency of \"enlightened,\" rationally-minded individuals to subject themselves to totalitarian and dehumanizing systems is identified as a common concern of the Frankfurt School theorists and of Eggers's dystopia. The Circle, in this perspective, is read as a critical study of the twenty-first-century's version of Enlightenment ideology, and of the social mechanisms that lead to a state of \"voluntary servitude.\" By means of a theory-informed analysis of the novel's principal thematic concerns, it is demonstrated that the world constructed by Eggers exhibits central traits associated with an enlightened society by Horkheimer and Adorno, and it is shown how the novel embeds its depiction of the self-destructive tendencies of this society in a discussion of social media and digital technology. This leads, eventually, to a reconsideration of the intellectual significance of The Circle.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno famously argued that \u2018myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology.\u2019 Although much scholarship has analyzed and built upon Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s insight, it has often conflated myth with another concept: epic. By closely reading Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s Dialectic of Enlightenment, this article disentangles the two concepts and elucidates key features of myth. Sacrifice, it argues, stood at the centre of myth, connecting and organizing its other dimensions. Next, the article reconstructs the lineage of Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s account of myth and sacrifice in the fields of anthropology, ethnology, and sociology. Specifically, Horkheimer and Adorno drew on analyses of sacrificial rites in these disciplines to argue that sacrifices constituted a transaction between worshipers and gods and, therefore, established control, disempowerment, and fraud. Finally, the article takes up Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s task of tracing the conduits between myth and enlightenment by identifying parallel features of sacrifice and modern wage labor. To conclude, the article indicates the significance of mythical sacrifice by connecting its analysis of wage labour to contemporary theorizing about the \u2018theological dimensions of capitalism.\u2019 Together, these arguments show the centrality of Dialectic to theories of myth as conceptual tools and critical resources.",

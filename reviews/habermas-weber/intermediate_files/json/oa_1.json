      "abstract": "The aim of this research essay is to examine the structural nature of theory in Information Systems. Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated.",

The analytical shifts leading up to the current preoccupation with international regimes have been both progressive and cumulative. And the field is pursuing its object of study in innovative ways that are bringing it closer to the theoretical core of more general international relations work. As we point out, however, the study of regimes as practiced today suffers from the fact that its epistemological approaches contradict its basic ontological posture. Accordingly, more interpretive strains, commensurate with the intersubjective basis of international regimes, should be included in the prevailing epistemological approaches. In addition, as a result of its enthusiasm for the concept of regimes, the field has tended to neglect the study of formal international organizations. Interpretive epistemologies can also help to link up the study of regimes with the study of formal international organizations by drawing attention to the roles these organizations play in creating transparency in the behavior and expectations of actors, serving as focal points for the international legitimation struggle, and providing a venue for the conduct of global epistemic politics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article is about current discourse regarding teaching and its regulation and reform. I argue that underlying most positions in current debates are two competing visions of teaching\u2014one technical and the other personal. Technical teaching is manifested in recent developments in English education\u2014for example, the National Curriculum, National Primary Strategy, accountability measures, and the drive for evidence\u2010based practice. Advocates of personal teaching tend to oppose these developments, which they see as 'deprofessionalising' teachers and 'dehumanising' educational relationships. I explore these two competing visions, examining their assumptions and assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Technical teaching and personal teaching are manifestations of broader worldviews, which I call instrumental rationality and experiential wisdom, respectively. Each vision captures critical aspects of teaching, yet each is also partial and problematic: teaching cannot and should not be reduced to either. Moreover, seeing the world in terms of one vision often blinds us to the realities and possibilities revealed by the other. When discourse is polarized between these two visions, conceptions of teaching methods and expertise are distorted, and critical questions regarding the interaction of teachers and teaching methods are eclipsed. I conclude the article with an illustration of how technical and personal teaching could be integrated in the design of curricular materials. Notes 1. I would like to gratefully acknowledge helpful comments received from Leah Austin, Noah Efron, Sharon Gilad, Josh Glazer, Yoram Harpaz, Norman Lefstein, Vally Lytra, Gemma Moss, Ben Rampton, Brian Street, Christopher Winch, Andrew Wright, members of the King's College London Research Workshop in Language and Literacy, Darrell Fraser, Diane Peck and members of the Victorian Department of Education and Training, participants in the Oxford Ethnography and Education Conference (September, 2003), two anonymous referees, and the Editors of this Special Issue. 2. My approach draws very heavily upon Foucault's work on discourse and problematisation. See, for example, his discussion of the relationships between medical gaze, discourse, knowledge categories, and practice in The Birth of the Clinic (Foucault, 1963/1994 Foucault, M. 1994. The birth of the clinic: an archaeology of medical perception, New York: Vintage books. [Google Scholar]). Although vision (as I use the term here) is not a central theme in Foucault's exposition, it certainly can be read into the text (especially in chapter 2, 'A political consciousness'). 3. Weber emphasizes that, as an analytical construct, the ideal type does not necessarily correspond to any empirical sociological reality. However, in my interpretation, the ideal type does correspond roughly with the reality of people's hopes, visions and understandings. This approach is consistent with Weber's idea of social science involving interpretation of the meanings that social action poses for its own participants. It also arises from an attempt to come to terms with a certain ambivalence in Weber's account of the ideal type. On the one hand, he warns the reader not to take 'ideal' to mean normatively desirable; on the other hand, he repeatedly uses the word 'utopia' as a synonym for an ideal type. Weber obviously doesn't mean that ideal types are utopian in the sense that they represent his own utopian yearnings. But clearly the word is loaded with value connotations: it doesn't make sense to speak of a utopia being ''ideal' in the strictly logical sense of the term'. The conception of an ideal type that I'm proposing includes an attempt to reconstruct the utopian yearnings distributed among (at least some) members of the social group studied. Thus, I add to Weber's idea that constructing ideal types is 'a matter \u2026 of constructing relationships which our imagination accepts as plausibly motivated' the requirement that ideal types be anchored in discourse evidence demonstrating the actual existence of these motivations among members of the studied society. 4. The confrontation between instrumental rationality and experiential wisdom has its roots in unresolved tension between Enlightenment and Romantic visions. 5. In my discussion of instrumental rationality, I use 'Science' in the positivist sense of so\u2010called 'hard' science, which is the ideal type at the root of this rationality. I am not claiming that this is the only legitimate form of science, or that physicists and engineers actually perform according to this scientistic vision. I do claim that this is the vision invoked when policy\u2010makers talk about rationalising education (see below). 6. My analysis draws in particular upon Weber (1914/1968 Weber, M. 1968. Economy and society: an outline of interpretive sociology, New York: Bedminster Press. (original edn 1914) [Google Scholar]), Arendt (1958/1998 Arendt, H. 1998. The human condition, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. (2nd edn; original edn 1958)[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), Gadamer (1960/1998 Gadamer, H. G. 1998. Truth and method, New York: Continuum. (2nd edn; original edn 1960) (J. Weinsheimer & D. G. Marshall, Trans.) [Google Scholar]), Habermas (1963/1974 Habermas, J. 1974. Theory and practice, London: Heinemann. (original edn 1963) [Google Scholar]), Toulmin (1990 Toulmin, S. 1990. Cosmopolis: the hidden agenda of modernity, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. [Google Scholar]), Ritzer (2000 Ritzer, G. 2000. The McDonaldization of society, Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press. [Google Scholar]) and Dunne (1997 Dunne, J. 1997. Back to the rough ground: practical judgment and the lure of technique, Revisions, Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). These theorists disagree in their specific diagnoses of the relevant aspects of instrumental rationality and, especially, the possibility and contours of alternative modes. My discussion is not intended as a summary of their common denominator, rather as my own attempt to select and integrate ideas from their theories. 7. Where certainty and predictability are not (yet) possible, probability and reliability become the next best alternatives. Note that exact estimations of probability are made possible by calculability (see below). This example shows the close connection between knowledge of the natural world and its technological manipulation: 'causal relationships [are] mapped onto instrumental ones' (Sch\u00f6n, 1991 Sch\u00f6n, D. A. 1991. The reflective practitioner: how professionals think in action, Aldershot: Avebury. [Google Scholar], p. 34). 8. Having failed to achieve the 2002 objective of 80% of pupils at Level 4 in Literacy by the end of Key Stage 2, the Government has begun relaxing (National) objectives\u2010driven discourse, discarding the 85% target for 2004, and instead encouraging schools to attain their targets 'as soon as possible' (Halpin, 2003 Halpin, T. (2003, May 20) National primary school targets scrapped, Times Online http://www.timesonline.co.uk/ (accessed 25 May 2003). [Google Scholar]). 9. In addition to the numerous published materials (the Framework, Planning Exemplifications, video), initial professional development included two days of training for the Headteacher, Literacy Coordinator and a Governor and tended to 'concentrate on the mode of operation and implementation' (Riley, 2001 Riley, J. 2001. The National Literacy Strategy: success with literacy for all?. The Curriculum Journal, 12(1): 29\u201358. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]). There are of course at least two other possibilities to explain the short professional development program: (1) teachers are already well\u2010versed in the strategies and methods involved, and/or (2) the DfES lacks the resources (including teachers' willingness and time) to engage in in\u2010depth professional development. 10. It is noteworthy that Success for All was cited as one of the programs upon which the English National Literacy Strategy was modelled (Beard, 1999 Beard, R. 1999. National literacy strategy: review of research and other evidence, Sudbury, , UK: Department for Education and Employment. [Google Scholar]), and Slavin participated in early policy discussions. 11. Considered independently of other developments, the evidence\u2010based practice movement could be seen as yet another clash between positivist and interpretivist epistemologies (or, more narrowly, experimental and non\u2010experimental methodologies) in the chronic 'paradigm wars' (Gage, 1989 Gage, N. L. 1989. The paradigm wars and their aftermath\u2014a historical sketch of research on teaching since 1989,. Teachers College Record, 91(2): 135\u2013150. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) endemic to social scientific research. What distinguishes this current skirmish are the raised expectations regarding the role of research in directing practice, and the broader social and political context shaped by instrumental rationality. The editors of a recent issue of the British Educational Research Journal (Stronach & Hustler, 2001 Stronach, I. and Hustler, D. 2001. Old whine in new battles,. British Educational Research Journal, 27(5): 523\u2013525. [Google Scholar]), express a sense of d\u00e9ja\u2010vu at the re\u2010emergence of the issue, and one can sense an element of uneasiness at publishing what they consider to be essentially a rehashing of previous arguments. Hammersley (2001 Hammersley, M. 2001. On 'systematic' reviews of research literatures: a 'narrative' response to Evans & Benefield,. British Educational Research Journal, 27(5): 543\u2013554. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science \u00ae] , [Google Scholar]), however, in that same issue, after resurrecting criticisms of the drive for systematic reviews on epistemological and methodological grounds, does conclude with reflections on what is new in the current situation: i.e. changes in the wider political context, educational accountability, research funding and academic autonomy. 12. But see Machin and McNally's (2004 Machin, S. & McNally, S. (2004) 'The Literacy Hour', CEE Discussion Paper No.43; IZA Discussion Paper No. 1005 (available at http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/opsp.asp?prog = CEE (http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/opsp.asp?prog=CEE) ). [Google Scholar]) longitudinal study of the effects of the National Literacy Project on pupil achievement. 13. The Framework's aims are ostensibly established technically, through the study of markets and occupations, and identification of reading skills needed by high school graduates (which in turn become teaching objectives). The value lurking in the shadows of this value\u2010free rationality is that of the self\u2010regulating system (see McCarthy, 1978 McCarthy, T. 1978. The critical theory of Jurgen Habermas, London: Hutchinson & Co. [Google Scholar], pp. 8\u201312). Note the functionalist values embedded in the names Department of Education and Employment and Department of Education and Skills. See Lawn (1990 Lawn, M. 1990. From responsibility to competency\u2014a new context for curriculum studies in England and Wales,. Journal of Curriculum Studies, 22(4): 388\u2013392. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science \u00ae] , [Google Scholar]) for a critique of the implications of the English National Curriculum for teacher responsibility. 14. As with the section on instrumental rationality I am simplistically lumping together a number of different and often contradictory ideas into one construct. Similar terms, from which I draw in my explication of experiential wisdom, include reflective practice (Sch\u00f6n, 1991 Sch\u00f6n, D. A. 1991. The reflective practitioner: how professionals think in action, Aldershot: Avebury. [Google Scholar]), practical reason (Toulmin, 1990 Toulmin, S. 1990. Cosmopolis: the hidden agenda of modernity, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. [Google Scholar]), and pedagogical tact (van Manen, 1995 van Manen, M. 1995. On the epistemology of reflective practice,. Teachers and Teaching: theory and practice, 1(1): 33\u201350. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]). Reconstructing this ideal type is especially difficult since most experientialists tend to be more elaborate in their criticisms of instrumental rationality than in their positive suggestions of alternatives (see Squires, 1999 Squires, G. 1999. Teaching as a professional discipline, London: Falmer Press. [Google Scholar], on this point; and Eraut, 1995 Eraut, M. 1995. Sch\u00f6n shock: a case for reframing reflection\u2010in\u2010action,. Teachers and Teaching: Theory and Practice, 1(1): 9\u201322. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar], for a specific discussion of Sch\u00f6n and his followers). 15. This circle (and terms such as 'horizon' and 'projection') are of course based on the hermeneutic circle, in which understanding of a text (or other experience) is enabled and constrained by one's horizon of pre\u2010understandings, which in turn is shaped by the texts read (and experiences undergone) (Gadamer, 1960/1998 Gadamer, H. G. 1998. Truth and method, New York: Continuum. (2nd edn; original edn 1960) (J. Weinsheimer & D. G. Marshall, Trans.) [Google Scholar]; Heidegger, 1927/1996 Heidegger, M. and Stambaugh, J. 1996. Being and time: a translation of Sein und Zeit, SUNY series in contemporary continental philosophy, Albany, NY: State University of New York Press. (original edn 1927) [Google Scholar]). Theories of personal teaching rarely explicitly make this analogy or cast their discussions in hermeneutic terms (exceptions include Birmingham [2004 Birmingham, C. 2004. Phronesis: a model for pedagogical reflection,. Journal of Teacher Education, 55(4): 313\u2013324. [Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae] , [Google Scholar]], who proposes phronesis as a model for reflection, and Field and Latta [2001 Field, J. C. and Latta, M. M. 2001. What constitutes becoming experienced in teaching and learning?. Teaching and Teacher Education, 17(8): 885\u2013895. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]], who treat the problem of learning from experience as a hermeneutic problem). The affinity of practical knowledge and hermeneutics is developed by Gadamer, who employs the former as a model of the latter. 16. Note that theoretically a teacher's encounters with her colleagues, academic sources and administrative directives adhere to the same form as that of classroom experience (i.e. projection, experience, reflection and assimilation). Their location on the circle's periphery reflects the primacy of classroom experience in this way of thinking about knowledge in teaching. Similarly, a more theoretically complete account of the formation of teachers' horizons would need to discuss the critical roles of tradition and language. 17. Quoted in Halliday (1998 Halliday, J. 1998. Technicism, reflective practice and authenticity in teacher education,. Teaching and Teacher Education, 14(6): 597\u2013605. [Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae] , [Google Scholar]), p. 598. 18. Social scientific theories about the world are partially constitutive of the reality they study. In the words of Hannah Arendt (writing about behaviourism): 'the trouble \u2026 is not that they are wrong but that they could become true, that they actually are the best possible conceptualization of certain obvious trends in modern society' (1958/1998 Arendt, H. 1998. The human condition, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. (2nd edn; original edn 1958)[Crossref] , [Google Scholar], p. 322). 19. And of course confrontation between instrumentalists and experientialists, who occupy different positions in the political and social field (e.g. policy\u2010makers vs. teachers, educational psychologists vs. teacher educators). See Labaree (1992 Labaree, D. F. 1992. Power, knowledge, and the rationalization of teaching\u2014a genealogy of the movement to professionalize teaching,. Harvard Educational Review, 62(2): 123\u2013154. [Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae] , [Google Scholar]) for a genealogical analysis of the movement to rationalise teaching in the US. He links the methodisation of instruction to an attempt to bolster the professional status of teacher education. 20. Absolute instrumentalism may also include an element of what Buchler (1961 Buchler, J. 1961. The concept of method, New York: Columbia University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) calls 'methodalotry': 'where interest in method ceases to be merely primary and becomes militantly exclusive, where regard for a method begins to be related inversely to regard for its results'.",

In response to this insight, Habermas develops a novel account of normativity, which locates the normative demands of critical theory within the socially instituted practice of communicative understanding. Although Habermas has claimed otherwise, this new foundation for critical theory constitutes a novel and innovative form of \"immanent critique.\" To argue for and to clarify this claim, I offer, in section 1, a formal account of immanent critique and distinguish between two different ways of carrying out such a critique.",

The value of history is presented in its interpretive power, in both investigating the particular through individual cases and how these are related to larger societal forces of change producing explanation, establishing causal relations, and achieving understanding as Verstehen in its full hermeneutic sense.

Following to some extent in the Weberian tradition, but also in the public administration tradition, this author recognises the distinction as follows: administrative roles are those that are formally structured and whose legitimacy and power are sanctioned through policy regimes that do not require acceptance of the person but the responsibilities of the office; leadership roles, on the other hand, are constructed in interpersonal relationships that are not necessarily formally sanctioned, whose legitimacy is conferred by followers on individuals for their personal qualities, and whose value is not bound by existing organisational or institutional purpose and policy regimes. In other words, administration is an organisationally constituted formal category, and leadership is a personally constructed political category. 8. The International Handbook does include a few chapters that have short subsections providing historical overviews of educational programs and research approaches; however, they play a marginal role in the overall publication. 9.

      "abstract": "The 1990s have been called the \u201cempowerment era,\u201d yet growing evidence suggests that empowerment programs often fail to meet the expectations of both managers and employees. To provide a better understanding as to why empowerment programs often fail and to suggest how such failures may be averted, we examine the power behind empowerment. Ironically, although power and empowerment are inextricably linked, much of the work on empowerment in the business literature has been devoid of any discussion of power. We present a four-dimensional model which shows the multifaceted way in which power works. In it, we observe the similarities and differences in the ways that different theorists have approached the study of power, notably those ascribing to mainstream, critical, and Foucauldian perspectives. We then use this power model as a lens with which to examine empowerment practices in business. This analysis suggests a number of possible reasons for the failure of business empowerment programs and provides directions for future research and practice which might address these shortcomings.",

      "abstract": "Hermeneutics has much to offer those interested in qualitative inquiry, and is especially suitable for work of a textual and interpretive nature, yet writings in hermeneutics are frequently viewed as dense and impenetrable, particularly to North American audiences and those unfamiliar with the Continental Philosophical tradition. Drawing on Hans Georg GADAMER, as well as other hermeneutic thinkers, an introductory overview of five characteristics of a hermeneutic approach is offered in this paper. Further, it is suggested that hermeneutics can fruitfully be partnered with a critical approach. In this regard, a critical attitude and a metaxological approach are explored and a conceptualization of critical hermeneutics is proposed. It is suggested that hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics implicitly underpin qualitative inquiry, both of which emphasize the interpretive act of understanding, and a dialogue on this subject is invited.

      "abstract": "Since the emergence of neo-evolutionism in the 1960s, various critiques of the theory of social or socio-cultural evolution have been forwarded, including notably those of Immanuel Wallerstein, Alain Touraine and Anthony Giddens who decisively reject the idea of evolution. Within this context, J\u00fcrgen Habermas's theory of socio-cultural evolution has also become a specific object of critique, the best known in the English-speaking world being, perhaps, Michael Schmid's critique (1982). While the latter is ultimately based on neo-Darwinistic assumptions (1982a, 1987) which allow a non-Marxist alternative to be pitted against Habermas's position, a significant immanent critique has been taking shape during the late 1970s and 1980s the contours of which are at present starting to become visible, despite the fact that as yet it is nowhere developed and presented in a systematic manner. I have in mind here the work of younger authors belonging to the circle around Habermas, such as Johann Arnason, Axel Honneth, Hans Joas, G\u00fcnter Frankenberg, Ulrich R\u00f6del, and Klaus Eder, who have not only developed a critique of Habermas but are also engaged in developing an alternative to him within the framework of critical theory.",

      "abstract": "Intersubjectivity refers to the variety of possible relations between perspectives. It is indispensable for understanding human social behaviour. While theoretical work on intersubjectivity is relatively sophisticated, methodological approaches to studying intersubjectivity lag behind. Most methodologies assume that individuals are the unit of analysis. In order to research intersubjectivity, however, methodologies are needed that take relationships as the unit of analysis. The first aim of this article is to review existing methodologies for studying intersubjectivity. Four methodological approaches are reviewed: comparative self\u2010report, observing behaviour, analysing talk and ethnographic engagement. The second aim of the article is to introduce and contribute to the development of a dialogical method of analysis. The dialogical approach enables the study of intersubjectivity at different levels, as both implicit and explicit, and both within and between individuals and groups. The article concludes with suggestions for using the proposed method for researching intersubjectivity both within individuals and between individuals and groups.",

With maps of chlorophyll distribution derived from remotely sensed data on ocean color as input, deduction of a suitable algorithm for primary production is a problem in applied plant physiology. An algorithm is proposed that combines a spectral and angular model of submarine light with a model of the spectral response of algal photosynthesis. To apply the algorithm at large horizontal scale, a dynamic biogeography is needed for the physiological rate parameters and the biological structure of the water column. Fieldwork to obtain this type of data should be undertaken so that the use of satellite data in modern biological oceanography may be optimized.",

A range of criticisms are discussed which target the underlying premises, the analytical methodology and the disputed areas of reader response and the integration of contextual factors. Controversial issues such as the predominantly negative focus of much CDA scholarship, and the status of CDA as an emergent \u201cintellectual orthodoxy\u201d, are also reviewed. The conclusions offer a summary of the principal criticisms that emerge from this overview, and suggest some ways in which these problems could be attenuated.",

For more than 30 years, critical research in information systems (IS) has challenged the assumption that technology innovation is inherently desirable and hence to the benefit of all. Nevertheless, how researchers view the nature of being critical has changed over time, and so too have the ways that they pursue their critical agenda and argue for their contributions. In this paper, I present a brief historical account of critical IS research, tracing the theoretical perspectives that have been dominant at different times and the empirical efforts that were guided by them. As part of tracing our current position I examine two key texts authored by Chrisanthi Avgerou and Geoff Walsham, who pursue different types of critical agenda and make distinctive empirically based contributions concerning the substantive issue of global diversity in IS innovation and its consequences. Overall, I suggest that the IS field now accepts broad definitions of the nature of being critical, but despite having a body of empirical critical research from which to learn, we are not making the most of our opportunities to do so, which retards further development. While I do not seek to develop a prescription for conducting and evaluating critical research, or try to encourage lengthy confessional accounts of research conduct in all journal papers, I do argue that we need more explicit reflections about our sustained long\u2010term efforts in the field. Such reflections might consider the way we develop our critical arguments and insights, and what we strive for and accomplish through our interventions. In effect, the IS field has not yet reached a position where the theory and practice of doing critical research are informing each other.",

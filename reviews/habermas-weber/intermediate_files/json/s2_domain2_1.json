Ashgate Publishing Co., 2012. \nKeith Breen \u00e9 Lecturer de Political Theory na School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\"Under Weber's Shadow\" presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jurgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. \"Under Weber's Shadow\" will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.",

      "abstract": "Max Weber characterized modernity as a state of disenchantment, in which rationalization strips the world of sacred meaning. To counter political apathy, he suggested that democratic elections could generate quasi-charisma, infusing sterile bureaucratic rule with symbolic energy. This essay interrogates whether such democratic charisma can truly heal the spiritual deficit of modern life. Drawing on recent critiquesincluding Storms claim that enchantment never vanished and Marottas refined model of demagificationit argues that democratic charisma is structurally frail. While elections, media spectacles, and populist appeals may momentarily mobilize affect, they remain embedded in the very legalrational procedures that produce disenchantment. As a result, quasi-charisma offers only transient simulations of meaning that are easily routinized or manipulated. By exposing these limits, the paper illuminates the persistent tension between efficient governance and authentic collective belief, a dilemma central to contemporary populism and declining institutional distrust.",

      "abstract": "the standardisation of religion along neoliberal or consumerist lines. The post-secular is becoming a neoliberal post-secular, as the title suggests. The arguments that Possamai presents are thus, on the whole, fairly pessimistic. The i-zation of society signals the inexorable progress of the \u2018iron cage\u2019 and religion today, no more than in Weber\u2019s time, is offering effective resistance or a hopeful alternative. Nonetheless, throughout the presentation and then in focused fashion in the last section, the author tries to offer some hope and from time to time he muses that this i-zation may not be all bad. The prime way that he translates this hopeful pessimism is to suggest what he styles as a possible small step that global religion can take to mitigate at least the worst effects of the neoliberal regime, namely its generation of severely exacerbated and increasing global inequality. Here enters what the author offers as a \u2018global compassionate tax\u2019\u2014the idea that religions (apparently through their institutionalised forms) turn their generally tax exempt status around and voluntarily, cooperatively, transnationally, and outside formal state structures generate a vast fund, a kind of super-faith-based enterprise for equality. In other words, religions should (or could) turn precisely their neoliberal and standardised alignment with neoliberalism to the advantage of those that the system so effectively marginalises. Overall, Possamai\u2019s analysis is well-presented, coherently and frequently convincingly argued, and above all interesting. It is a speculative and mostly theoretical enterprise that illustrates its arguments very well, even though, of course, illustration is not the same as proof. It makes a solid contribution to what is indeed a much larger and very much an ongoing discussion. However, the reader does have to accept, if only provisionally, the theoretical and normative analyses of the main theoretical framers\u2014Weber, Jameson, Ritzer, and Habermas \u2014as presented by the author. And this reviewer admits that he does have a little bit of trouble doing that. However, this is a book to be recommended, if only to let an important debate continue.",

      "abstract": "Max Weber famously diagnosed both an excess and a subordination of meaning in modernity when he coined the term disenchantment next to the fragmentation and irreconcilability of value spheres. Unlike Weber, however, who sought to keep the ideological and the rationalist sides of the modern divide together, his immediate followers capitalized either on his decisionism (i.e. Carl Schmitt) or on his universalism (i.e. J\u00fcrgen Habermas). In an attempt to develop a constructive perspective on the question of how we can conceive of irreconcilable values within a larger normative horizon, this article introduces Karl Jaspers\u2019s interpretation and refinement of Weber\u2019s work. Most fundamentally, Jaspers\u2019s existentialist philosophy of communication sought to turn Weber\u2019s warring gods into a source of solidarity rather than divisiveness. I argue that Jaspers did so in rooting human freedom not in the decision or the law but in an experiential uncertainty and the knowledge not to know. The article closes with a discussion of some practical and theoretical implications of Jaspers\u2019s thought for our understanding of diversity in unity in post-truth times.",

## Narrative Arc

The review traces a single argumentative thread: Habermas inherits Weber's diagnosis of modernity as rationalization but finds it simultaneously indispensable and defective. He accepts the sociological architecture — differentiation of value spheres, formal rationalization of law and economy, the paradox of rationalization — while arguing that Weber's "subject-centered" or "philosophy of consciousness" framework prevents him from theorizing communicative rationality, generating immanent normative critique, or envisioning a path beyond the iron cage. The review tracks this inheritance-with-transformation across three connected registers: (1) substantive theory of modernity and rationalization; (2) philosophy of history and developmental logic; (3) methodology and the question of value-freedom. In each register, the same structure recurs: Habermas appropriates a Weberian framework, expands it through communicative rationality, and is then challenged by Weberian scholars who argue that the expansion either distorts Weber's original or fails to solve the problem it claims to resolve. The conclusion situates the debate in the secondary literature's three distinct waves and identifies what remains genuinely unresolved.

## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the Habermas-Weber relationship as a constitutive tension in twentieth-century social theory, not merely a scholarly episode, and specify what is at stake in the five research questions.

**Content**:
- The Habermas-Weber engagement is not incidental: Weber functions as both resource and foil throughout Habermas' mature work, most extensively in *The Theory of Communicative Action* (TCA, 1981/1984-87) but also in *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* (PDM, 1985/1987) and earlier essays. Framing this as a sustained structural relationship, not isolated citations.
- The three core moves Habermas makes (from Domain 1's overview): (i) appropriating Weber's multi-dimensional concept of rationality while expanding it beyond the purposive-rational; (ii) criticizing "selective rationalization" for ignoring communicative rationalization of the lifeworld; (iii) repositioning Weber within the Frankfurt School lineage against Adorno and Horkheimer's retreat into negative dialectics.
- Why Weber matters for Habermas' project: Weber's rationalization thesis provides the empirical-sociological backbone for Habermas' diagnosis of modernity, but Weber's own conclusions (iron cage, polytheism of values, value-freedom) are precisely what Habermas' theory of communicative rationality is designed to supersede.
- Brief note on the "Weberian Marxism" lineage (Dahms 1997): Habermas is not the first to put Weber and Marx in dialogue; this situates TCA's Weber chapters within an intellectual genealogy running from Lukács through the Frankfurt School.
- Scope and structure preview: four substantive sections — rationalization and modernity; the colonization thesis and the iron cage; philosophy of history; methodology.

## Section 1: Reconstructing Rationalization — What Habermas Takes from Weber and Why

**Section Purpose**: Establish precisely what Habermas appropriates from Weber's rationalization thesis in TCA Vol. 1, and identify the conceptual moves by which he transforms it. This section answers Research Question 1 and sets up the critical discussions in Sections 2 and 3.

**Main Claims**:
1. Habermas accepts Weber's core sociological picture — differentiation of cultural value spheres, formal rationalization of law and economy through Protestantism, the paradox of rationalization — but argues Weber's action-theoretic framework (built around purposive-rational action) renders communicative rationality theoretically invisible.
2. The "Weberian Marxism" tradition (Lukács to Habermas) clarifies why Habermas needs Weber: the rationalization thesis provides the missing link between Marx's political economy and a theory of cultural-ideological legitimation that Marx lacked.
3. Habermas' critique of Adorno and Horkheimer's *Dialectic of Enlightenment* turns on a claim about Weber: the first generation radicalized Weber's pessimism while abandoning his sociological differentiation of rationality types, collapsing into a negative totalism from which critical theory cannot escape.

**Subsection 1.1: Weber's Rationalization Typology and Its Limits**

**Papers**: habermas1984tca1 (Domain 2), kalberg1980types (Domain 5), kalberg1990action (Domain 5), schluchter1981rise (Domain 2)
**Content**: Reconstruct Weber's own account as the background against which Habermas operates. Kalberg's taxonomy of Weber's four rationality types (practical, theoretical, substantive, formal) establishes the richness of the Weberian framework. Schluchter's developmental-historical reconstruction of Western rationalism shows how Weber's comparative historical sociology of world religions feeds into his account of Occidental rationalization. This subsection provides the basis for the debate about whether Habermas' critique of Weber's "one-dimensionality" is well-founded.
**Connection**: Kalberg's Weber is already more multi-dimensional than Habermas' critique acknowledges — this tension will be exploited in the critical discussion.

**Subsection 1.2: Habermas' Communicative Turn as Reconstruction of Weber**

**Papers**: habermas1984tca1 (Domain 1), ingram1987habermas (Domains 1 and 5), dahms1997weberian (Domain 1), habermas1987pdm (Domain 5), hohendahl1985dialectic (Domain 1)
**Content**: Trace Habermas' specific moves in TCA Vol. 1, Chapters II-III: the distinction between cultural rationalization (differentiation of validity claims) and societal rationalization (institutionalization of purposive-rational subsystems); the claim that Weber conflates these two dimensions; and the resulting argument that the communicative dimension of modernity has gone unrealized, not because it is unavailable, but because of selective institutional development. Ingram's commentary provides the most analytically detailed secondary account. Hohendahl situates this within Habermas' broader critique of the Frankfurt School.
**Connection**: Establishes the positive reconstruction before the critique — Habermas claims to be completing what Weber's own framework points toward but cannot achieve.

**Subsection 1.3: The "Weberian Marxism" Lineage**

**Papers**: dahms1997weberian (Domain 1), schecter2010critique (Domain 5), corchia2015frankfurt (Domain 1)
**Content**: Dahms traces the lineage from Lukács to Habermas as two versions of "Weberian Marxism" — using Weber's rationalization thesis as a resource for updating Marx's critique. Schecter's genealogy (Weber to Frankfurt School to Habermas) frames Habermas' appropriation as the culmination of a tradition, not an isolated reading. Corchia's historical account of the young Habermas' early divergence from Adorno and Horkheimer adds chronological depth.
**Connection**: Situates Habermas' Weber reading as motivated by theoretical problems inherited from the Frankfurt School, not just by independent scholarly interest in Weber.

**Section Summary**: Habermas appropriates the core architecture of Weber's rationalization thesis while identifying a structural blind spot — the communicative dimension — that Weber's action-theoretic starting point prevents him from seeing. The reconstruction is theoretically motivated by Habermas' need to overcome the aporias of first-generation critical theory. But Kalberg's richer Weber already complicates the "one-dimensionality" charge.

**Word Target**: 700–800 words

## Section 2: From Iron Cage to Colonization — The Pathology Debate

**Section Purpose**: The iron cage and its successor, the colonization of the lifeworld, are the twin diagnostic concepts through which Habermas most directly inherits and transforms Weber. This section answers Research Question 2 and engages the central critical debate: whether Habermas "domesticates" Weber's tragic account of rationalization's pathologies.

**Main Claims**:
1. Habermas reformulates Weber's "iron cage" as "colonization of the lifeworld" — shifting from a diagnosis of total formal rationalization to a two-track account in which system rationalization pathologically invades communicatively structured domains. This is presented as completing Weber's diagnosis while providing the normative standpoint Weber lacks.
2. Critics (Breen, Bowring, Horowitz, Ingram) argue that this reformulation domesticates Weber's tragic insight: Weber saw the conflict between value spheres and the loss of religious meaning as genuinely irresolvable, whereas Habermas treats it as a pathological deviation from an available communicative rationality.
3. The "domestication" objection is sharpened by attention to Weber's concept of disenchantment (Green, Carroll, Etzrodt): if disenchantment is not primarily a cognitive learning process (Habermas' reading) but a tragic moral stance or a complex of distinct rationalization processes, then Habermas' reconstruction misses what is most philosophically serious in Weber.

**Subsection 2.1: The Colonization Thesis as Weberian Reinterpretation**

**Papers**: habermas1987tca2 (Domain 1), jutten2011colonization (Domain 1), bowring1996lifeworld (Domain 2), prasai2024emancipation (Domain 5)
**Content**: Trace the structure of the colonization thesis — uncoupling of system from lifeworld, monetarized and bureaucratized steering media, pathological colonization of family, culture, and the public sphere. Jütten's defense of the thesis (thirty years on) shows its continuing relevance while exposing its normative lacuna: Habermas does not explain what is wrong with colonization from the perspective of those colonized. Prasai's 2024 reconstruction frames the thesis as "lifeworldization" — the positive program of communicative expansion as the criterion of critique. Bowring's immanent critique argues the lifeworld concept is structurally empty because it strips out strategic action, making the domestication objection internal rather than external.
**Connection**: Establishes what the colonization thesis claims before turning to the critics.

**Subsection 2.2: Domesticating Weber — The Tragedy Objection**

**Papers**: breen2012weber (Domain 2), horowitz1994comedy (Domain 6), ingram1994philosophy (Domain 5), green2005disenchantment, wellmer1991persistence (Domain 2), bernstein2001rethinking (Domain 6)
**Content**: The central critical cluster. Breen's sustained treatment argues that Habermas' intersubjectivism depoliticizes the lifeworld by treating communicative rationalization as a developmental learning process rather than a site of political struggle — domesticating Weber's awareness of irreducible value conflict. Horowitz argues Habermas replicates Weber's dualism at a higher level of abstraction. Green's distinction between sociological and philosophical disenchantment shows what Habermas misses: the philosophical meaning of disenchantment as a tragic moral stance. Wellmer's internal critique shows that aesthetic rationality resists the communicative framework, pressuring the coherence of Habermas' reconstruction of value-sphere differentiation. Bernstein's Adornian critique charges Habermas with creating conceptual dualisms (system/lifeworld) that allow systemic domination to proceed unchallenged.
**Connection**: These critics share a family concern — that Habermas' communicative optimism is purchased at the cost of the tragic dimension in Weber's diagnosis.

**Subsection 2.3: Weber's Disenchantment — A More Complex Picture**

**Papers**: etzrodt2024rationalization (Domain 2), carroll2011disenchantment (Domain 2), kalberg1990rationalization (Domain 5), scaff1987fleeing (Domain 5)
**Content**: Recent Weber scholarship (Etzrodt 2024) challenges the premise shared by Habermas and his critics — that disenchantment is Weber's master concept. Etzrodt argues that Weber's rationalization processes are better described through a differentiated vocabulary (de-magification, Marxist alienation, Hegelian alienation, anomie) that Habermas' reading flattens. Carroll's theological reading contextualizes disenchantment as embedded in Protestant assumptions that Habermas' secular-rational reconstruction cannot preserve. Scaff argues that Weber's analysis of charismatic counter-movements and cultural creativity represents resources for political theory that both Habermas and his pessimistic interpreters overlook.
**Connection**: This subsection raises the interpretive stakes: the debate about domestication depends on which Weber we are reading. A more complex Weber complicates both Habermas' appropriation and the domestication critique.

**Section Summary**: Habermas transforms the iron cage into the colonization thesis, gaining a normative criterion for critique but losing the tragic specificity of Weber's diagnosis. Whether this represents genuine advance or domestication depends on how one reads Weber's disenchantment — as a sociological description or as a philosophical-tragic stance — and on whether communicative rationality is genuinely immanent in modernity or an external normative standard.

## Section 3: Philosophies of History — Developmental Logic versus Value-Freedom

**Section Purpose**: The rationalization debate has a temporal dimension: both Weber and Habermas offer accounts of historical development, but with radically different normative and methodological commitments. This section answers Research Question 3 and connects the substantive theory to the methodological one.

**Main Claims**:
1. Weber's "developmental history" (Entwicklungsgeschichte) charts the singular path of Occidental rationalization through comparative world-religion studies, deliberately resisting universal teleology and refusing to ground normative commitments in developmental history. Habermas, by contrast, constructs a quasi-evolutionary account of social learning grounded in universal pragmatics and an ontogenetic analogy (Piaget/Kohlberg), treating communicative rationalization as having cross-cultural developmental standing.
2. This quasi-evolutionary account is the hinge on which Habermas departs most radically from Weber: it is what allows Habermas to claim that communicative rationality is genuinely immanent in modernity (not externally imposed) and thus to generate normative critique from within the tradition of modernity itself — something Weber's value-freedom explicitly prohibited.
3. Critics from within and outside the Habermasian tradition challenge whether the quasi-evolutionary account succeeds: the ontogenetic analogy is contested (Strydom, Oh), the Eurocentrism question recurs (Delanty), and the distinction between developmental logic and developmental dynamics is undertheorized (Oh 2023).

**Subsection 3.1: Weber's Comparative History versus Habermas' Social Evolution**

**Papers**: schluchter1981rise (Domain 3), mccormick2007conclusion (Domain 3), habermas1975reconstruction (Domain 3), habermas1979history (Domain 3)
**Content**: Schluchter's reconstruction of Weber's developmental history — as a unified account tracing disenchantment through world religions to modern institutional structures — provides the foil against which Habermas' quasi-evolutionary alternative is measured. McCormick's focused treatment of Habermas' philosophy of history (in the context of European state transformation) directly addresses the tension between Habermas' normative developmental logic and Weber's value-freedom. Habermas' own programmatic texts (1975, 1979) articulate the distinction between history and evolution and defend the quasi-evolutionary account against charges of teleologism.
**Connection**: Establishes the structural divergence before engaging the critics.

**Subsection 3.2: The Ontogenetic Analogy and Its Problems**

**Papers**: strydom1987collective (Domain 3), strydom1992ontogenetic (Domain 5), oh2023developmental (Domain 3), kirkpatrick2003evolution (Domain 3), owen2002between (Domain 3)
**Content**: The most technically focused subsection. Strydom's two contributions (1987, 1992) develop the "ontogenetic fallacy" critique — the charge that collective social learning cannot be mapped onto individual developmental psychology in the way Habermas requires. Oh (2023) extends this with the distinction between cumulative phylogenetic culture and non-cumulative individual ontogenetic learning, arguing that learning processes do not automatically translate into social evolution. Kirkpatrick defends a modified Habermasian account (social development as "progress" rather than "evolution"), and Owen provides the most sustained book-length treatment of Habermas between reason and history.
**Connection**: These internal critiques show the quasi-evolutionary account is structurally strained, which bears directly on whether Habermas can generate the immanent critique of Weber he claims.

**Subsection 3.3: Eurocentrism and the Uniqueness of the West**

**Papers**: delanty1997habermas (Domain 3), mendieta2018axial (Domain 3), conill2025nueva (Domain 3)
**Content**: Delanty's critique argues that Habermas' social learning theory remains embedded in Occidental rationalism and reproduces Weber's "uniqueness of the West" thesis despite disclaimers. Mendieta traces Habermas' late engagement with the Axial Age concept (via Jaspers) as a quasi-historical anchor for postmetaphysical thinking, showing how Habermas uses Weber's world-religions framework while attempting to universalize it. Conill-Sancho (2025) addresses Habermas' most recent genealogy of postmetaphysical thinking, noting that Joas' alternative challenges the Weberian secularization thesis that Habermas largely accepts.
**Connection**: The Eurocentrism cluster shows that the philosophy-of-history debate has real stakes beyond academic interpretation — it bears on the cross-cultural validity of Habermas' normative claims.

**Section Summary**: Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account of social learning is his most decisive departure from Weber: it provides the developmental foundation for claiming that communicative rationality is immanent in the history of modernity, not externally imposed. But the ontogenetic analogy is challenged from within the Habermasian tradition, and the Eurocentrism critique suggests that Habermas may reproduce rather than overcome the provincialism of Weber's Occidental rationalism.

## Section 4: Methodological Legacy — Verstehen, Ideal Types, and Reconstructive Science

**Section Purpose**: The methodological dimension of the Habermas-Weber relationship is underexplored in the secondary literature relative to the substantive debates about modernity and rationalization. This section answers Research Question 4 and provides the technical grounding for questions about value-freedom, interpretive sociology, and the status of normative claims in social theory.

**Main Claims**:
1. Habermas inherits Weber's concern with interpretive understanding (Verstehen) but replaces the value-freedom postulate with a reconstructive methodology that makes explicit the normative presuppositions embedded in communicative action — a move Habermas sees as necessary, not arbitrary.
2. The critical question is whether "reconstructive science" extends, transforms, or breaks with Weberian ideal-typical analysis. There are two competing readings: the continuity thesis (ideal types are already hermeneutic; Habermas refines a tradition already implicit in Weber) and the transformation thesis (rational reconstruction introduces a normatively charged third mode unavailable in Weber's value-free Verstehen).
3. The methodological departure from value-freedom is what makes Habermas' quasi-evolutionary theory of history possible — and contentious. The tension Finlayson identifies (normative questions persisting as unresolved within TCA) traces back to this foundational methodological choice.

**Subsection 4.1: Weber's Methodological Legacy — Verstehen, Ideal Types, and Value-Freedom**

**Papers**: aronovitch2011interpreting (Domain 4), kedar2007ideal (Domain 4), shamsi2024verstehen (Domain 4), whimster1995theory (Domain 6)
**Content**: Reconstruct Weber's methodological framework in sufficient detail to support the comparison. Aronovitch defends ideal types as blending interpretive understanding with causal explanation without reducing either — a via media between pure hermeneutics and causal science. Kedar's hermeneutic reading of ideal types (as concepts of significance, not commonality, with Wittgensteinian family-resemblance relations) challenges the standard positivist reading and supports the continuity thesis. Whimster argues that Weber's interpretive sociology already resists purely instrumental rationality, making Habermas' communicative turn less revolutionary than it claims to be.
**Connection**: Establishes a richer picture of Weber's methodology before the Habermasian transformation.

**Subsection 4.2: Habermas' Reconstructive Science — Transformation or Extension?**

**Papers**: pedersen2008habermas (Domain 4), outhwaite2014reconstructive (Domain 4), baynes1989rational (Domain 4), anicker2025hermeneutics (Domain 4), shahwirman2023inquiry (Domain 4), mccarthy1991objectivity (Domain 6)
**Content**: Pedersen's analysis of rational reconstruction as Habermas' central methodological device positions it as neither inductive nor interpretive but as revealing the grammar of practical reason — analogous to Chomskian linguistics. Outhwaite frames reconstructive science as a genuine third mode beyond both positivism and hermeneutics, arguing that it constitutes Habermas' original methodological contribution. Anicker's 2025 account of Habermas' theoretical practice — as a problem-centered combination of hermeneutic sensitivity and systematic integration — illuminates the method in operation. George McCarthy's incollection directly addresses the neo-Kantian tension (objectivity, value-freedom, and normative claims) shared by Weber and Habermas, arguing Habermas does not fully resolve Weber's value-pluralism challenge.
**Connection**: The transformation thesis: Habermas introduces normative reconstruction precisely where Weber's value-freedom postulate prohibited it.

**Subsection 4.3: Value-Freedom and the Normative Stakes**

**Papers**: habermas1973postscript (Domain 4), wilson1986critical (Domain 4), verovsek2022habermas (Domain 6)
**Content**: Habermas' 1973 postscript to *Knowledge and Human Interests* is the most explicit statement of why social science cannot be methodologically unified under a positivist model: the practical and emancipatory knowledge-constitutive interests are irreducible to the technical interest in prediction — a direct challenge to Weber's Wertfreiheit. Wilson's historical account of critical theory's evolution from negative to constructive methodology situates this as a constitutive move in the Frankfurt School project. Verošvek's recent (2022) reconciliatory reading challenges both by arguing that Habermas misreads Weber's value-freedom as ethical relativism — Weber's methodological prescription is not the substantive ethical position Habermas critiques.
**Connection**: Verošvek's reading, if correct, suggests that some of Habermas' methodological departures address a problem Weber did not have. This functions as an objection to the overall framing of TCA's Weber chapters.

**Section Summary**: Habermas inherits Weber's interpretive concerns while replacing the value-freedom postulate with a reconstructive-normative methodology. Whether this represents a genuine methodological innovation (Pedersen, Outhwaite) or an overstatement of the distance from Weber (Kedar, Whimster, Verošvek) is contested. The methodological gap between Weber and Habermas is narrower on some reconstructions than on others, with direct implications for how we assess Habermas' philosophy of history.

**Word Target**: 600–700 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the secondary debate, identify what remains genuinely contested, and position the Habermas-Weber relationship within the larger questions animating the research.

**Content**:
- Periodization of the secondary literature: three waves. First wave (1980s-90s): dominated by TCA commentaries (Ingram, McCarthy, Honneth/Joas); general verdict that Habermas successfully overcomes Weber's pessimism through communicative rationality. Second wave (2000s-2010s): more skeptical and comparative (Breen, Schecter, Owen); argues that Habermas remains "under Weber's shadow" — his lifeworld/system dualism may replicate rather than transcend Weberian dualisms. Third wave (2015-present): reassessment in light of contemporary Weber studies (Etzrodt, Verošvek 2022, Prasai 2024, Conill-Sancho 2025); questions whether Habermas' Weber is a "straw Weber" constructed to justify the communicative turn.
- Four unresolved tensions that run through all three waves: (a) whether Habermas' communicative rationality is genuinely immanent in modernity or an externally imposed normative standard; (b) whether the colonization thesis adequately captures what is wrong with rationalization from the perspective of those affected (Jütten's normative lacuna); (c) whether the ontogenetic analogy is sustainable as the foundation of Habermas' philosophy of history; (d) whether the domestication of Weber's tragic dimension is a cost of the communicative turn or a corrective to an overstatement.
- Notable gap: the relationship between Habermas' later work (post-TCA, especially *Between Facts and Norms* and the recent *Also a History of Philosophy*) and Weber is underexplored — most secondary literature concentrates on TCA. Conill-Sancho's 2025 treatment of Habermas' genealogical project and the secularization thesis is an exception, suggesting the Habermas-Weber relationship evolves beyond the 1981 text.
- The research project's contribution: attending carefully to all five research questions (rationalization, iron cage, philosophy of history, methodology, and secondary reception) illuminates a systematic relationship that secondary literature has tended to treat piecemeal — focusing on one register (usually the rationalization debate) while neglecting others (especially methodology and philosophy of history).

### Key Debates to Foreground (not just describe)

1. **Domestication vs. Advance**: Is Habermas' communicative reformulation of Weber's iron cage a genuine theoretical advance (Ingram 1987, Prasai 2024) or a domestication of Weber's tragic sociology (Breen 2012, Horowitz 1994, Bowring 1996)?

2. **One-dimensionality charge**: Does Weber's rationalization framework actually reduce rationality to purposive-rational action (Habermas' charge) or is it already multi-dimensional in ways that complicate the charge (Kalberg 1980, 1990; Scaff 1987)?

3. **Ontogenetic fallacy**: Can Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account of social learning sustain the normative work it is asked to do, or does the ontogenetic analogy generate a foundational problem (Strydom 1987, 1992; Oh 2023)?

4. **Straw Weber**: Does Habermas read Weber's value-freedom as ethical relativism when Weber meant only a methodological prescription — and if so, does this undermine Habermas' case for the communicative departure (Verošvek 2022; Whimster 1995)?

5. **Eurocentrism**: Does Habermas' universal-pragmatic developmental account escape or reproduce Weber's Occidental particularism (Delanty 1997)?

### INCOMPLETE Entries (excluded from synthesis, may be flagged as gaps)

The following papers appear in the BibTeX files but carry the INCOMPLETE/no-abstract flag and should NOT be cited in the synthesis. They represent genuine gaps in the available evidence base:

- finlayson2013normative (Constellations 2013) — normative tensions in TCA; potentially important for Section 4
- cookeJutten2013tca (Constellations 2013) — TCA 30th anniversary survey
- honnethJoas1991communicative — first-wave TCA critical reception
- breen2012weber (Domains 1, 3, 5) — INCOMPLETE in some domains but HAS ABSTRACT in Domain 2; cite from Domain 2 entry
- mccormick2007weber (Domain 3) — most sustained book on Weber-Habermas; INCOMPLETE; flag as significant gap
- owen2002between (Domain 3) — INCOMPLETE; flag as gap (first book-length English treatment of Habermas' social evolution)
- habermas1975reconstruction (Domain 3) — INCOMPLETE
- habermas1979history (Domain 3) — INCOMPLETE; both primary Habermas texts on evolution are INCOMPLETE — flag this gap explicitly in the synthesis
- schluchter1981rise (multiple domains) — INCOMPLETE
- strydom1987collective, kirkpatrick2003evolution (Domain 3) — INCOMPLETE
- horowitz1994comedy (Domain 6) — INCOMPLETE; important for tragedy/comedy critique
- mccarthy1991objectivity (Domain 6) — INCOMPLETE

Note to synthesis writer: several of the most important philosophy-of-history and methodology primary texts by Habermas himself (1975, 1979) are INCOMPLETE. The synthesis should acknowledge this gap and be appropriately cautious about reconstructing Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account without direct access to these texts; rely on secondary reconstructions (Oh 2023, Kirkpatrick 2003) that describe their arguments.

### Tone and Style Notes

- The review should be analytical and descriptive: report what authors argue, not how persuasive those arguments are.
- Resist the pull toward either "Habermas wins" or "Weber wins" framings; the debates are genuinely unresolved.
- The "domestication" objection and the "ontogenetic fallacy" objection are the two strongest lines of critique and should receive proportionate treatment.
- The Eurocentrism critique (Section 3.3) and the methodology section (Section 4) are relatively underexplored in the secondary literature; the synthesis should note where the existing literature is thin.

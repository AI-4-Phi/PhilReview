## Section 3: Philosophies of History — Developmental Logic versus Value-Freedom

The rationalization debate between Weber and Habermas has a temporal dimension that is just as fundamental as the substantive questions about modernity's pathologies: both thinkers offer accounts of historical development, but with radically different normative and methodological commitments. Weber's comparative-historical sociology traces the singular path of Occidental rationalization through world religions while deliberately resisting universal teleology and refusing to ground normative commitments in developmental history. Habermas, by contrast, constructs a quasi-evolutionary account of social learning that treats communicative rationalization as having cross-cultural developmental standing. This divergence is the hinge on which Habermas departs most radically from Weber: the quasi-evolutionary account is what allows Habermas to claim that communicative rationality is genuinely immanent in modernity and thus to generate normative critique from within the tradition of modernity itself—something Weber's value-freedom explicitly prohibited.

### 3.1 Weber's Comparative History versus Habermas' Social Evolution

Wolfgang Schluchter's reconstruction presents Weber's developmental history as a unified theoretical project tracing the "disenchantment of the world" through comparative studies of world religions to modern institutional structures (Schluchter 1981). This developmental history is deliberately typological rather than evolutionary: Weber charts the distinctive rationalization trajectory of the Occident without claiming that this path represents a universal developmental logic applicable to all societies. The uniqueness of the West, for Weber, is a contingent historical outcome of specific religious and institutional configurations, not a stage in a universal evolutionary sequence.

Habermas' quasi-evolutionary alternative transforms this picture in two decisive respects. First, as McCormick (2007) argues, Habermas draws on a progressive developmental logic grounded in communicative rationality that allows him to maintain value-laden normative commitments while claiming to reconstruct rational learning processes immanent in social evolution. This developmental logic distinguishes history (the contingent unfolding of events) from evolution (the underlying developmental logic of social formations), arguing that social evolution is characterized by increasing capacity for reflexive problem-solving and moral-practical learning (Habermas 1979). Second, this framework enables Habermas to treat the rationalization of worldviews as having cross-cultural validity: the differentiation of validity spheres and the development of postconventional moral consciousness represent developmental achievements, not merely Occidental peculiarities.

**Methodological Note**: Two primary texts central to Habermas' philosophy of history—"Towards a Reconstruction of Historical Materialism" (Habermas 1975) and "History and Evolution" (Habermas 1979)—are marked INCOMPLETE in the available literature base (no abstracts available from academic databases). These texts articulate Habermas' distinction between history and evolution and defend the quasi-evolutionary account against charges of teleologism. The synthesis here relies on secondary reconstructions by McCormick (2007), Oh (2023), and others; direct engagement with Habermas' arguments awaits access to these primary sources.

The contrast between Weber's developmental history and Habermas' social evolution is not merely terminological. Weber's value-freedom postulate prohibited grounding normative commitments in claims about historical development: to identify a directional pattern in history and then derive normative guidance from it would violate the fundamental separation between empirical-descriptive social science and value-laden political commitment. Habermas' quasi-evolutionary framework explicitly rejects this prohibition, arguing that the reconstructive identification of learning processes—the increasing differentiation of validity claims, the development of postconventional moral reasoning—is not an arbitrary imposition of values but a rational reconstruction of developmental potentials embedded in communicative practice itself.

### 3.2 The Ontogenetic Analogy and Its Problems

The mechanism underlying Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account is the analogy between individual moral development (ontogenesis) and collective social learning (phylogenesis). Drawing on Piaget's cognitive developmental psychology and Kohlberg's stages of moral consciousness, Habermas argues that social formations can be ranked according to their organizational principles in ways analogous to how individual moral development moves from preconventional through conventional to postconventional stages. This ontogenetic analogy is what gives Habermas' developmental logic its quasi-empirical standing: it is not a speculative philosophy of history but a reconstructive claim grounded in developmental psychology.

Piet Strydom's sustained critique challenges this analogy at its foundation. In his early work on collective learning (Strydom 1987), Strydom examines the concessions Habermas makes to critics regarding the collective subject of historical learning, arguing that Habermas is forced to acknowledge that collective learning cannot be straightforwardly mapped onto individual ontogenetic development. Strydom develops this into a full-scale immanent critique in his 1992 article, identifying what he calls the "ontogenetic fallacy": the illicit transfer of Piagetian developmental logic from individual psychology to social evolution (Strydom 1992). Individual moral development occurs through structured interactions in face-to-face contexts with identifiable developmental sequences; collective social formations do not exhibit the same kind of structured progression, and the identification of "learning" at the collective level is far more theoretically contested than Habermas' framework acknowledges.

Oh (2023) extends and refines this critique by introducing a distinction between cumulative phylogenetic culture and non-cumulative individual ontogenetic learning. At the level of culture (phylogenesis), knowledge and symbolic resources can accumulate across generations: later societies inherit the achievements of earlier ones. But individual ontogenetic learning is non-cumulative—each person must recapitulate moral development within their own lifetime rather than inheriting it directly. Habermas' theory, Oh argues, systematically underestimates the importance of what he calls "developmental dynamics"—the actual mechanisms by which learning processes translate (or fail to translate) into social evolution. The developmental logic that Habermas reconstructs—the sequence from mythical through religious to postmetaphysical worldviews—does not explain how or why this logic gets instantiated in actual historical processes. Learning does not automatically guarantee social evolution.

Graeme Kirkpatrick offers a qualified defense of Habermas by distinguishing between "evolution" (blind variation-selection without directional normative content) and "progress" (normatively directed developmental learning). Kirkpatrick (2003) argues that Habermas' theory of social development is better understood as a theory of progress than evolution proper, and that critics who reject the evolutionary metaphor often miss the normative-reconstructive character of Habermas' project. This defense, however, does not fully resolve the ontogenetic analogy problem: even if we grant that Habermas is theorizing progress rather than evolution, the question remains whether the Piagetian developmental sequence provides adequate empirical grounding for the claim that communicative rationality represents a developmental achievement rather than a culturally contingent value commitment.

David Owen's book-length treatment provides the most sustained English-language analysis of Habermas' position "between reason and history," arguing that Habermas occupies an unstable middle ground—committed to normative universalism yet constrained by reconstructive, quasi-empirical methods (Owen 2002). Owen's work is marked INCOMPLETE in the available literature base (no abstract available), representing a significant gap in the synthesis: as the first comprehensive treatment of Habermas' theory of social evolution and progress, it would provide essential context for evaluating whether the developmental logic successfully navigates between Weberian value-freedom and speculative teleology.

### 3.3 Eurocentrism and the Uniqueness of the West

The ontogenetic analogy raises a further question: does Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account escape or merely reproduce Weber's "uniqueness of the West" thesis? Gerard Delanty argues that Habermas' theory of social learning and communicative rationality remains embedded in "Occidental rationalism"—it reproduces the Western-centric developmental logic of Weber's own rationalization thesis even while claiming universal validity (Delanty 1997). The core problem, for Delanty, is that Habermas' framework presupposes that universal morality and communicative competence can be articulated in only one cultural form and according to one logic of development. The politics of identity and recognition—central to contemporary multicultural societies and global justice—are not adequately handled by Habermas' quasi-evolutionary framework because that framework treats cultural difference as developmentally indexed rather than as reflecting irreducibly plural modes of rationality. Delanty proposes a weaker notion of rationality and a cosmopolitan model of cultural transformation as correctives, but these would require abandoning the developmental logic that grounds Habermas' departure from Weber.

Eduardo Mendieta traces a different line of engagement, examining how Habermas' late work increasingly draws on Karl Jaspers' "Axial Age" hypothesis—the idea that a fundamental transformation of human consciousness occurred simultaneously across civilizations around 800-200 BCE (Mendieta 2018). Habermas uses the Axial Age concept as a quasi-historical anchor for his theory of postmetaphysical thinking and postsecular consciousness, bringing him into explicit dialogue with Weber's own world-religions project. The Axial Age framework allows Habermas to claim that the rationalization of worldviews is not uniquely Occidental but represents a cross-cultural developmental pattern. However, Mendieta argues, Habermas' appropriation of the Axial Age concept opens itself to liabilities by not taking sufficient critical distance from the Eurocentric developmental assumptions embedded in Jaspers' original formulation.

Conill-Sancho (2025) addresses the most recent phase of Habermas' engagement with these questions in his 2023 work *Also a History of Philosophy*. Habermas carries out a genealogy of postmetaphysical thinking that examines how religious commitments persist even in contemporary philosophy, accepting the Weberian secularization thesis while subjecting it to genealogical reconstruction. Conill-Sancho notes, however, that Hans Joas' alternative to both Weber and Habermas on secularizing rationalization challenges the developmental framework both thinkers share: Joas argues that the secularization thesis itself may be a Eurocentric projection rather than a universal developmental pattern. If Joas is correct, then both Weber's developmental history and Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account rest on questionable assumptions about the relationship between rationalization and the decline of religious worldviews.

The Eurocentrism critique suggests that the quasi-evolutionary account—the very mechanism by which Habermas claims to generate immanent normative critique from within modernity—may reproduce rather than overcome the provincialism of Weber's Occidental rationalism. Habermas gains normative resources unavailable to Weber by treating communicative rationalization as a developmental achievement with cross-cultural validity. But if the developmental logic itself is culturally indexed to Occidental patterns, then the normative standpoint is not genuinely universal but rather a more sophisticated version of the Western-centric teleology that Weber's value-freedom was designed to avoid.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers Habermas' direct engagements with Max Weber, most
extensively in The Theory of Communicative Action (1981/1984-87), but also
in The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity (1985/1987) and scattered essays.
Habermas' engagement with Weber is not merely scholarly commentary but a
constitutive element of Habermas' own theoretical architecture: he uses Weber
as both a resource and a foil to construct his account of modernity,
rationalization, and the pathologies of modern social life. Three main moves
define Habermas' Weber reception: (1) appropriating Weber's multi-dimensional
concept of rationality while expanding it beyond the purely formal-purposive;
(2) criticizing Weber's "selective" rationalization thesis for reducing
societal rationalization to the institutionalization of purposive-rational
action while neglecting communicative rationalization; (3) repositioning
Weber within the Frankfurt School lineage -- correcting the one-sidedness of
Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment while preserving their
diagnosis of modernity's paradoxes.

The secondary literature on Habermas-Weber falls into three clusters: (a)
commentaries closely following TCA's appropriation of Weber (Ingram, Dahms,
McCarthy); (b) comparisons of Habermas and Weber on specific themes such as
democracy, law, lifeworld, and disenchantment (Breen, Jutten, Hohendahl);
(c) reconstructions of the broader intellectual context, especially Habermas'
relation to the Frankfurt School's Weber reading (Corchia, Bernstein, Honneth
& Joas). A key debate concerns whether Habermas' critique of Weber's
"selective rationalization" is itself one-sided: critics argue that Habermas
imports normative assumptions that Weber deliberately avoided, projecting a
communicative ideal onto a contested historical account.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is the most directly relevant to the research project: it
identifies the precise textual locations where Habermas engages Weber and
reconstructs the theoretical purposes driving those engagements. The
secondary literature helps assess the adequacy of Habermas' reading and
situates it within broader debates about modernity, rationalization, and
the scope of critical theory. Central to the project's concern with
history, development, and methodology is Habermas' claim that Weber's own
theory, properly reconstructed, points beyond Weber's pessimistic
"diagnosis of the times."

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The search returned fewer English-language journal articles directly focused
on Habermas' methodology vis-a-vis Weber's Verstehen sociology than expected;
this dimension is largely treated as internal to book-length studies.
Several Russian-language translations of TCA sections on Weber appear in
databases but lack independent scholarly significance for this domain.
The recent (post-2010) literature tends toward specialized sub-questions
(law, democracy, neoliberalism) rather than comprehensive accounts of
Habermas' Weber reception.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish between Habermas as interpreter of Weber
(in TCA) and Habermas as theorist who departs from Weber (in PDM and later
work). The colonization thesis (TCA Vol 2) and the disenchantment analysis
(TCA Vol 1) should be treated as connected moments within a single
argumentative strategy. Schluchter's "Rise of Western Rationalism" provides
a useful independent reconstruction of Weber that can serve as a touchstone
for evaluating Habermas' reading.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Habermas' appropriation of Weber (reconstructive): 5 papers -- Habermas TCA
  Vol 1 and Vol 2, Ingram, McCarthy, Dahms
- Critique of Habermas' Weber reading: 4 papers -- Hohendahl, Breen, Finlayson,
  Cooke & Jutten
- Contextualization within Frankfurt School lineage: 3 papers -- Corchia,
  Bernstein (ed.), Honneth & Joas (eds.)
- Weber as independent reference point: 3 papers -- Schluchter, Habermas PDM,
  Jutten colonization

  title = {The Theory of Communicative Action, Volume 1: Reason and the Rationalization of Society},
  year = {1984},
  publisher = {Beacon Press},
  address = {Boston},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Volume 1 of Habermas' major theoretical work opens with a sustained engagement with Weber's theory of rationalization. Habermas accepts Weber's diagnosis that modernity is characterized by the differentiation of cultural value spheres (science, morality, art) but argues that Weber's concept of rationalization is structurally biased toward purposive-rational (zweckrational) action, leaving communicative rationality -- the rationality embedded in ordinary language and oriented toward mutual understanding -- theoretically invisible. He then reconstructs Weber's account of the Protestant ethic and the institutionalization of formal rationality in capitalism and law, arguing these represent only a selective realization of rationality potential.

  RELEVANCE: This is the primary source for Habermas' Weber reception. The opening methodological chapters also address Weber's Verstehen sociology and its neo-Kantian presuppositions, making this directly relevant to questions about methodology and philosophy of social science. Habermas positions his own theory of communicative action as completing what Weber's theory points toward but cannot itself achieve.

  POSITION: Foundational text for Habermas' appropriation and critique of Weber's rationalization thesis; establishes the two-level society concept (lifeworld/system) as a response to Weber's "iron cage" diagnosis.

I. To begin, there is the question ofhow, of approach, attitude, method

Saint Augustine’s significance for Hannah Arendt — a modern, apparently secular Jewish woman who took as given the irreversibility of “modern ‘deaths’ — of God, metaphysics, philosophy.” (Life of The Mind, p. 11) — is an obviously tantalizing question. On the face of it, these two thinkers would seem at best incompatible. In this superb book, Stephan Kampowski takes up this challenging inquiry, following a winding trail through Arendt’s life as it is intriguinglymarked, both early and late in her work, by her citations of Augustine. Kampowski’s quest turns out to illuminate the whole of Hannah Arendt’s, and strands of Augustine’s, thought afresh. It does so in good measure because of his approach, on which I will therefore spend more than the usual time.

Kampowski neither forces either of these distinctive thinkers into the other’s terms nor stops when he has located divergences. Instead, as Arendt’s dissertation supervisor, Karl Jaspers, put it, he seeks “the heartbeat” of their philosophizing below and beyond tangles, by-ways, contradictions as well as similarities. To thus reflect on Augustine and Arendt as they cast light on each other is to remember and take seriously the fact that, however different their paths, both sought meaning to sustain lives in “dark times,” as the title of one of Arendt’s books has it. Augustine and Arendt’s works, Kampowski observes,

share a fundamental concern: both are exercises in what may be called phenomenologicalExistenzphilosophy … The Augustine book is … about how a Christian … can be both in the world — because he is to love his neighbor — and not of the world — because he has the grounds of his existence in God (p. 4).

Similarly, Kampowski observes, Arendt’s biography of Rahel Varnhagen, to cite a key example, "presents Jewish existence in the European Christian world as analogous to the way Augustine conceives Christian existence in the secular world … in the world, but not of it … betweenpariahandparvenue" (p. 4). Kampowski’s focus on Arendt’s dissertation as it inquires into Augustine’s “question about the neighbor’s relevance for the believer who is estranged from the world and its desires.” This is a question that entails “the question of what it means to love God and oneself” and thus becomes of more than academic interest to Arendt specialists (Love and Saint Augustine, p. 3). In their differing ways and times, Augustine and Arendt inquired into the need for something beyond our merely subjective selves that without contradiction enables individual and collective freedom, thence action, responsibility and moral concerns.

Reading for meanings, not logic, Kampowski moves easily through arguments over whether or how Arendt’s early philosophizing in her dissertation is determining or irrelevant, and/or whether her thought is adequately systematic or consistent. He does the same with debates about whether she adequately provides definitions and theories ofaction, ofethics. Eschewing dueling dilemmas here too, he writes, "But in our opinion it is possible to understand ‘theory’ also as anopensystematization of thought, which occurs, for instance, already the moment we make distinctions," a generous — and realistic — move that, in ethics as in action, allows us to approach a “much larger field, in which the questions that Arendt” — as well as Augustine — “posed and sought to answer … have a rightful and central place” (p. xix).

  title = {The Theory of Communicative Action, Volume 2: Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason},
  year = {1987},
  publisher = {Beacon Press},
  address = {Boston},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Volume 2 develops the colonization-of-the-lifeworld thesis, which is Habermas' reformulation of Weber's "iron cage" metaphor. Habermas argues that the pathologies of modernity diagnosed by Weber as formal rationalization are better understood as the uncoupling of system integration (coordinated by money and power) from social integration (coordinated by communicative action), followed by the pathological "colonization" of the lifeworld by system imperatives. Weber's "paradox of rationalization" -- that the very process of rationalization destroys the substantive values that motivated it -- is reinterpreted as a structural consequence of selective institutionalization.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the research project's concern with Habermas' transformation of Weber's historical sociology and his diagnosis of modernity. The Weber-inflected analysis of law, bureaucracy, and capitalism in this volume traces how Habermas reshapes Weber's concepts through his own framework rather than simply receiving them.

  POSITION: Key statement of Habermas' colonization thesis as a Weberian-critical diagnosis of modernity's pathologies; reads alongside TCA Vol 1 as a two-part reinterpretation of Weber's legacy.

  title = {The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures},
  year = {1987},
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In this collection of lectures, Habermas traces the philosophical discourse of modernity from Hegel through poststructuralism, situating Weber as a pivotal figure in the transition from philosophy to social theory as the primary site of reflection on modernity. Weber's rationalization thesis is characterized as the first systematic attempt to translate Hegel's philosophy of history into the empirical-analytical terms of social science. Habermas also uses this text to sharpen his critique of Adorno and Horkheimer's retreat from Weber's insights.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to the research project's questions about Habermas' positioning relative to the broader Frankfurt School reading of Weber and to how he conceptualizes the "history" of modernity as a quasi-evolutionary process with an internal logic.

  POSITION: Places Habermas' Weber engagement in the broader context of modern European intellectual history; important for understanding Habermas' meta-theoretical claims about rationality and historical development.

  abstract = {It is clear how people who have been dispossessed of their cultures -- exiles, refugees, or members of a conquered nation, for instance -- might suffer from a loss of concepts that makes it hard or impossible for them to make sense of their lives and their world.[1]But what about those of us who are more fortunate, whose cultures are seemingly intact? Is conceptual loss a problem we face? What would that mean, and what is there to be done about it? These are Niklas Forsberg’s questions.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

In addressing them, Forsberg takes Iris Murdoch as his “primary discussion partner” (1), yet it is Stanley Cavell’s ordinary language philosophy that provides the book’s philosophical vision. The work proceeds less as an argument than as an elaboration of a family of ideas: that conceptual loss may result not only from large-scale cultural disruptions but also from a misfit between the way an individual leads her life and the words or concepts she uses; that one who suffers from conceptual loss may not realize it; that a great many and perhaps all of us in the West do so suffer; that established ways of doing philosophy both generate conceptual loss and help to blind us to it; that works of philosophy can also serve as mirrors that reveal to those who suffer from conceptual loss the truth about their condition; that literature can do the same and that this is a prime source of its philosophical significance; that the remedy for conceptual loss often involves rediscovering and renewing ordinary language; that Iris Murdoch’s novels and philosophy are best understood in these terms -- as attempts to alert us to our impoverished conceptual condition and to lead words back to their everyday use.

Why Murdoch? She saw us as suffering “a general loss of concepts, the loss of a moral and political vocabulary” that would enable us to see ourselves in connection to values and realities that transcend us.[2]Murdoch connected this loss to the diminished status of religion and the ascendance of science in the modern period. And in addition to being a significant philosopher and cultural critic, she was one of the major novelists of the second half of the twentieth-century. She is very well-suited to Forsberg’s project. For this reason, and as a distant admirer of Cavell, I was excited to see where it would lead. My feeling, however, is that Murdoch ends up serving more as a mouthpiece for ordinary language philosophy than as a conversation partner, and this keeps the book from making a strong contribution to our thinking about Murdoch or about conceptual loss.

Chapters 1-3 develop the interpretation of Murdoch’s philosophy and set the stage for an interpretation of Murdoch’s novelThe Black Princein chapter 4. Selective and somewhat disputable readings of Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein supply the concepts of mirroring and indirect communication Forsberg uses to interpret Murdoch. Chapter 5 extends the themes of these chapters through a discussion of Cora Diamond’s reading of J. M. Coetzee’sElizabeth Costello. The sixth and concluding chapter consolidates the proposed picture of how we must conceive, or reconceive, philosophy and literature if they are to help us reconnect to our language and achieve a more adequate self-understanding.

In developing his picture of Murdoch as an ordinary language philosopher, Forsberg places considerable weight on her assertion that

There is a two-way movement in philosophy, a movement toward the building of elaborate theories, and a move back again towards the consideration of simple and obvious facts. McTaggart says that time is unreal, Moore replies that he has just had his breakfast. Both these aspects of philosophy are necessary to it.[3]

His gloss on it is that the impulse to do philosophy properly issues in a return to ordinary -- but creatively renewed -- language. In his words:

When I find myself lost in our world, philosophy calls upon me to act and think. The words that everyone around us seems to employ without worry or hesitation are lost on me; they no longer seem to carry their weight for me. So I start to think. I theorize . . . But the only way that true peace of mind can be conquered is to make myself able to see that I share my world with those others whose words I had just repudiated. . . . we are instructed to see that the emergence of a philosophical problem often has its root in a pressing feeling that a mapping of theoretic ideality is necessary and the only way out is often a regained and reclaimed community (10).},

@article{dahms1997weberian,
  author = {Dahms, Harry F.},
  title = {Theory in Weberian Marxism: Patterns of Critical Social Theory in Luk{\'a}cs and Habermas},
  journal = {Sociological Theory},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {15},
  number = {3},
  pages = {181--214},
  doi = {10.1111/0735-2751.00032},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dahms identifies a "Weberian Marxism" tradition in which both Lukacs and Habermas appropriate Weber's rationalization thesis to reconstruct a critical theory of modern capitalism. He argues that both thinkers use Weber to mediate between Marx's political economy and Hegel's philosophy of history, transforming Weber's formal-rationalization concept into a basis for immanent social critique. Habermas' version differs from Lukacs' reification theory in grounding critique in the pragmatic presuppositions of communicative action rather than in proletarian class consciousness.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to understanding Habermas' appropriation of Weber as part of a longer tradition of critical theory and to the research project's question of how Habermas positions himself relative to the Frankfurt School's Weber reading. Provides an independent scholarly reconstruction of the intellectual genealogy linking Weber, Lukacs, and Habermas.

  POSITION: Situates Habermas' Weber reception in the "Weberian Marxist" tradition, reading it as a development from Lukacs' reification theory; useful for understanding the Frankfurt School mediation of Weber.

  abstract = {For Weberian Marxists, the social theories of Max Weber and Karl Marx are complementary contributions to the analysis of modern capitalist society. Combining Weber's theory of rationalization with Marx's critique of commodity fetishism to develop his own critique of reification, Georg Lukács contended that the combination of Marx's and Weber's social theories is essential to envisioning socially transformative modes of praxis in advanced capitalist society. By comparing Lukács ‘s theory of reification with Habermas's theory of communicative action as two theories in the tradition of Weberian Marxism, I show how the prevailing mode of “doing theory” has shifted from Marx's critique of economic determinism to Weber's idea of the inner logic of social value spheres. Today, Weberian Marxism can make an important contribution to theoretical sociology by reconstituting itself as a framework for critically examining prevailing societal definitions of the rationalization imperatives specific to purposive-rational social value spheres (the economy, the administrative state, etc.). In a second step, Weberian Marxists would explore how these value spheres relate to each other and to value spheres that are open to the type of communicative rationalization characteristic of the lifeworld level of social organization.},

  pages = {3},
  doi = {10.2307/488198},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hohendahl examines Habermas' critique of the first generation Frankfurt School -- particularly Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment -- arguing that Habermas reconstructs both texts as manifestations of Weber's influence. According to Hohendahl, Habermas reads the Dialectic of Enlightenment as radicalizing Weber's pessimistic diagnosis while abandoning Weber's sociological differentiation of rationality types, thereby leading to an aporias from which critical theory can only be rescued by the communicative turn. The essay traces how Habermas redefines the relationship between Weber, first-generation critical theory, and his own project.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the research project's question of how Habermas positions himself relative to the Frankfurt School's Weber reading. Demonstrates that the Weber reception is inseparable from Habermas' internal critique of his predecessors at the Frankfurt Institute.

  POSITION: Reads Habermas' critique of the Dialectic of Enlightenment as embedded in his broader reinterpretation of Weber; argues Habermas uses Weber to rescue critical theory from the cul-de-sac of negative dialectics.

  abstract = {A well-known newspaper caricature, printed some twenty years ago, pictures the Frankfurt School as a closely knit group with Horkheimer as a large father figure watching over the other members of the school, among them Theodor W. Adorno andJiirgen Habermas. This view of the relationship between the members of the Frankfurt School was quite common in Germany at that time: Habermas was seen not only as a member uf the School but more specifically-as a disciple of the older generation, someone who had started out from the position of Critical Theory, as it was developed in the 1940s and 1950s by Horkheimer, Marcuse and Adorno. Although this interpretation cannot account for all of Habermas' early work, notably not for his Strukturwandel der Offentlichkeit (1962) (Structural Change of the Public Sphere), it was plausible enough to find wide acceptance. Yet it was no accident that Habermas' first major study, which traces the evolution of the public sphere from the 18th to the 20th century and stresses the need for an enlightened and rational reconsideration of the public sphere under advanced capitalism, never found Adorno's and Horkheimer's complete acceptance. Their own critique of the process of enlightenment differed so markedly from the position which Habermas outlined that there could be no full consensus. In a certain way, I would argue, the later differences, especially those between Adorno and Habermas, were. already foreshadowed in Strukturwandel, although Habermas, when describing the decline of the liberal public sphere under organized capitalism, made use of the critique of mass culture formulated by the older generation and certainly did not indicate that he was in disagreement with the analysis offered in Dialectic ofEnlightenment. On the whole, however, conventional wisdom, treating Habermas as ajunior member of the Frankfurt School, was justified for the 1960s when Habermas, for instance, defended the position of the Frankfurt Institute in the Positivism Dispute against Karl Popper and his allies of the Cologne School. While Adorno and Popper in their addresses to the German Soziologentag of 1961 decided to suppress rather than highlight their theoretical and methodological differences, the younger generation, represented by Habermas and Hans Albert,},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ingram provides a systematic commentary on Habermas' TCA, with a dedicated chapter ("Weber's Theory of Rationalization") examining how Habermas appropriates and transforms Weber's typology of action and rationalization. Ingram clarifies the logical structure of Habermas' Weber interpretation -- the move from formal to communicative rationality, the critique of Weber's action-theoretic framework for being unable to ground normative standards, and the reconstruction of Weber's diagnosis of modernity through the lifeworld/system distinction. The book also situates this within Habermas' broader engagement with Lukacs and Adorno.

  RELEVANCE: One of the most detailed analytical reconstructions of Habermas' Weber interpretation available in English. Directly relevant to understanding what Habermas takes from Weber, what he transforms, and why. Chapter 4 specifically traces the Weberian architecture of TCA Vol 1.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Corchia traces Habermas' intellectual development from his early association with the Frankfurt School through the early 1960s, showing how his divergence from Adorno and Horkheimer was already evident in his approach to the Positivismusstreit and to the normative foundations of critical theory. The article argues that the young Habermas reasserts the emancipatory agenda of first-generation critical theory against the pessimism into which Adorno and Horkheimer had retreated, and that this reassertion required a different relationship to Weber's legacy.

Second, I will reconstruct Habermas’ contemplation of the Positivismusstreit, in light of his social scientific research programme in the 1960s. The thesis supported is that Habermas developed a position diverging from those of Adorno and Horkheimer, and that his position reasserted the agenda of the ‘first critical theory’.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Jutten defends and critically reconstructs Habermas' colonization thesis -- the claim that reification in modern societies arises when the communicative infrastructure of the lifeworld is colonized by money and power operating according to system logic. He argues the thesis remains compelling thirty years after TCA but requires modification: Habermas' functionalist framing cannot explain what is normatively wrong with colonization from the perspective of the persons affected, because it lacks a theory of the first-person experience of reification.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to assessing the adequacy of Habermas' transformation of Weber's "iron cage" into the colonization thesis. Shows how Habermas' Weberian inheritance (formal rationalization as system logic) generates a normative deficit that subsequent critical theorists have sought to address.

  abstract = {Abstract According to Habermas' colonization thesis, reification is a social pathology that arises when the communicative infrastructure of the lifeworld is 'colonized' by money and power. In this paper I argue that, thirty years after the publication of the Theory of Communicative Action, this thesis remains compelling. However, while Habermas offers a functionalist explanation of reification, his normative criticism of it remains largely implicit: he never explains what is wrong with reification from the perspective of the people whose social relations are reified. As a result, Habermas cannot explain why only some forms of colonization lead to reification effects. In particular, he suggests that reification effects result from the juridification of communicatively structured domains of action but not from the commodification of labour power. I criticize this argument and suggest that if the normative dimension of the colonization thesis is made explicit, a more nuanced explanation of reification becomes possible.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Finlayson argues that normative questions -- concerning how social life ought to be organized -- persist as an unresolved tension in Habermas' TCA, despite Habermas' methodological claim to be doing reconstructive social science rather than normative philosophy. He traces this tension back to Habermas' sociological inheritance from Weber: because Habermas adopts Weber's framework of action types and uses them to diagnose modernity's pathologies, the normative standards implicit in his critique (communicative rationality) are not independently justified but presupposed.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's concern with methodology: Finlayson shows that Habermas' use of Weber creates a persistent tension between empirical-analytical and normative-philosophical modes of inquiry that Habermas never fully resolves.

  POSITION: Critical reading of Habermas' Weber reception as generating internal methodological tensions; represents the recent literature on TCA's 30th anniversary that reassesses the legacy of Habermas' theoretical choices.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited collection brings together essays engaging Habermas' theory of modernity, including contributions from Wellmer, Giddens, Rorty, and McCarthy. Wellmer's essay is particularly important for the Habermas-Weber nexus, situating Habermas in the tradition from Hegel through Marx to Weber and arguing that Habermas' communicative turn represents a genuine advance beyond both the idealism of the former and the iron cage pessimism of the latter. McCarthy's essay examines the selectivity of rationalization processes in modern societies and the normative implications of Habermas' reconstruction.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a range of critical perspectives on Habermas' theory of modernity as filtered through his Weber engagement. McCarthy's contribution in particular raises the question of whether Habermas' selection among Weber's insights is principled or ad hoc, which is central to the research project's concerns.

  POSITION: Early critical reception of Habermas' Weber-inflected account of modernity; establishes the terms of debate about communicative rationality's adequacy as a normative foundation.

  abstract = {No doubt, I will digress and my language will be excessive, exaggerated, and too full of song. I apologize in advance; I am a musician and we do like to make things sing. However, the question to which I will, ultimately, be directing my attention, is whether there is any point in turning up music's volume in a place such as a book review which, strictly speaking, isn't meant for music. Andrew Bowie quotes a lovely passage from Schleiermacher that seems relevant here: "Song is the indifference of speech, crying, and laughing. Each of these can approach song, but none of them becomes song without ceasing to be what it is" (p. 159). Either the presence of music in my prose will debilitate it from performing the job at hand, or it will just momentarily drown out the philosophy which will inevitably, of its own accord, later float to the surface and then have to be identified and addressed, dissected and passed judgment upon. Indeed, except that in this instance the body that will end up on the slab (Bowie's formidableMusic, Philosophy, and Modernity) is itself, of course, full of music. Admittedly, Bowie's own language is almost completely free of any trace of the excesses that both characterize my own prose and which I am prepared, tentatively, to call music -- a point and problem to which I will return later. But its apparent sobriety nevertheless articulates a call for philosophy to address music, and, further (something potentially quite shocking) that music should not merely be philosophy's object of investigation since music, as it were, knows something that much Anglo-American philosophy, in particular, as yet does not. As Adorno writes: "We do not understand music -- it understands us. This is as true for the musician as for the layman. When we think ourselves closest to it, it speaks to us and waits sad-eyed for us to answer."[1]Or Bowie's words: "One possibility is to regard the 'philosophy of music,' not as the philosophy whose job is conceptually to determine the object 'music,' but rather as the philosophy that emerges from music" (p. 11).
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Of course, for many within the more recognizable Anglo-American traditions, the study of music within the discipline of philosophy will seem like a rather charming distraction. If one is humorously indulgent of continental quirks and practices (and, indeed, the love of philosophy for music is a predominantly continental habit), one might view music’s relation to philosophy as analogous to that of the mistress to the married man. (As the nineteenth-century novel attests, continentals have always been more fluent in translating extra-marital transgressions into normative conventions.) After all, music is often scripted either as a woman (Wagner), or as dangerous (St. Augustine), or even as both (the seminal myth here being that of the sirens). Nevertheless, although she may be the source of some of our most touching moments, that doesn't protect her from the fact that, in general, she is often deemed expendable. For the mistress, at least in the stock of clichés from which I'm drawing, doesn't work; she takes part neither in the earning of money, nor in the labor of reproducing the already existent moral and ethical structures of the social, which is traditionally the job of men and the family. And philosophy, of course, does claim to do work. Of course, feminist critics have been quick to argue against such assumptions. They have asserted that the mistress, particularly in the form of the courtesan, was absolutely central to the labor of social reproduction, and so have urged that, as an appropriate political act of disenchantment, we should cut the euphemisms and name things as they are -- hence the term sex worker. So what then is the work that music in philosophic society performs? Again, what does music know?

In an earlier book, Bowie, with his characteristic succinctness and disdain for hysterics, had posed a question that suggested that music, in fact, works very hard indeed: "If all we are can be stated in words, why does our being also need to be articulated in music, as every known culture seems to suggest?"[2]One might start to answer Bowie's question by performing the following experiment, which I frequently use when teaching: playing a piece of instrumental music (for example, the famous first prelude in c major from book 1 of J. S. Bach'sWell-Tempered Clavier) and then asking "what does it mean?" Sometimes (and often rather bizarrely) a student will give a detailed narrative response (of an old woman reminiscing about her life as she walks through a forest on a warm summer's evening, or some such). More often, students respond by listing their emotional reactions. Whatever the nature of the answers, though, what is nearly always to be noted is the infectious enthusiasm that the question in relationship to the music produces; the activity itself of being involved in answering seems meaningful to them. However, as the answers continue to tumble out of music's horn of plenty, the evidently meaningful nature of the activity per se comes into an increasingly contradictory relationship to the terms seemingly set up by the question itself. For one could be forgiven for assuming that pleasure in relationship to answering the question would come from answering it succinctly: What does it mean? It means x. And yet as the list of answers continues to swell, the possibility of establishing x fades. So music confronts us with the paradox that specific meaning is not a precondition for an activity being meaningful (full of meaning). Even if a student answers (smartly) from the other side of the question and asserts that music doesn't mean anything, the subsequent line of inquiry still leads us to a certain paradox. For even if it does not mean anything, music still is something; it is not an illusion, even if the location of its status as thing can involve us in torturous convolutions. And yet if using basic music theoretical terminology one were to start articulating the properties of this thing (in the Bach, for example, every two beats there are eight notes that arpeggiate one harmonic sonority, and so on), one's articulation would, in a frustrating way, always be lacking; only the grimmest of formalists would deny this point. So with music, language is either too tumescent or impotent, gloriously in excess of its goal, or frustratingly unable to reach it.

In Bowie's book, one of the primary pieces of work that music performs is to make available this knowledge: that there are places where things still work but where language (or at least a certain understanding of it) fails, or exceeds its limits. Tautologically, then, one might say that what music (and Bowie's own work on music) reveals is music -- as opposed to what we might refer to as "music as …" (for example, music as language). Viewed at this angle, Bowie's work could be placed in the context of work in both musicology and philosophy over the past decade that has sought, in the face of overly culturally determinative postmodern interpretive practices, to urge reconsideration of the notion of musical autonomy. In particular, one might mention here the work of Lydia Goehr, Berthold Hoeckner, and Martin Scherzinger. However, Bowie doesn't engage extensively with this work. Scherzinger's work, for example, doesn't occur at all -- which is a shame, since the dialogue, I feel, would be productive. Like these thinkers, Bowie is indeed wary of structures of understanding that pin music down too tightly (to language, culture, meaning, and the like), but that is less important to him since he is concerned with the autonomy of music as an object -- something which is always, by contrast, an important political and ethical move in Scherzinger's work, even though it is not always necessarily its goal. After all, one of Bowie's opening moves in the book is to critique and distance himself from the analytic tradition of philosophy beginning with Frege, Russell, and early Wittgenstein, and thus from the "idea that one can demarcate the forms of language which reliably connect with the world from those which do not, and can therefore employ the former to define meaning" (p. 5). Bowie is exceedingly wary of the subject-object distinction underlying the analytic tradition, precisely because he feels that insistence upon it fatefully limits what can be seen as productively constituting meaning. Although the

founders of the analytic tradition increased the precision of some kinds of argument and got rid of certain confusions regarding the logical status of a number of issues in philosophy … they did so at the expense of restricting the scope of what was considered worthy of, or even amenable to, philosophical attention. (p. 7)

Rather, Bowie seems primarily concerned with the autonomy of music as an activity, something that he would like to see philosophy itself aspire to: "the practice of philosophyitselfis also part of what it is to be human, which, like music, may play a world-disclosive role" (p. 45). Music is thus meaningful because in its specificity it does something that perhaps only music qua music, specifically, can do. It is, in part, because of this, that it can teach philosophy something and thus transform it, rather than philosophy remaining invariant as a practice which then knows music. Music is therefore an agent, not just an echo. As a musicologist -- and thus part of a discipline that continues to justify itself through the forging of allegiances with other more big-fisted disciplines in the university play ground (these days cultural studies, not so long ago mathematics) -- I find this incredibly liberating and empowering. For this reader, it is one of the finest contributions made by Bowie's impressive study.

In its strategic distancing from subject-object relations, then, Bowie's work holds strong affiliations with contemporary pragmatism. But this creates a two-way shock. Let me explain. As with many other books of Bowie's,Music, Philosophy, and Modernityis structured around a sequence of chapters that covers in roughly chronological order key moments within the history of continental (and almost exclusively German) philosophy during modernity -- starting with Herder and the question of language in the late eighteenth century, and then passing through Kant and Schlegel, Hegel, German Romanticism, Schelling and Nietzsche, Wagner and Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein and Heidegger, Adorno, and then concluding. Admittedly, this book is no mere historical survey, even though an increased sensitivity to historical context, which philosophy often fails to achieve, is one of Bowie's aims. Philosophers appear both historically and also more ahistorically: Adorno appears in the chapter on Wagner, Heidegger in the context of Herder; similarly issues in today's contemporary philosophical debates also intervene; the question of the work of music qua music pervades. The effect and intention is thus quite constellatory. Nevertheless, this "tradition" (with the exception in varying degrees of Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger) is one that most contemporary pragmatic thought often distances itself from, because of its assumed metaphysical pretentions. Further, one usually would rarely consider, as Bowie does, thinkers such as Adorno or the German Romantics as having a pragmatic streak.

In part, Bowie's aim is simply to show that there are connections that habitual partisanships within philosophy have worked to obscure. But in doing so, he actually performs the very kind of work that he claims music itself does. For Bowie'sMusic, Philosophy, and Modernityproject is directed by a particular set of ethical values that he derives most obviously, though not solely, from the modern German hermeneutic tradition. Thus, by means of his critique of the analytic tradition, he seeks to move beyond "the world being seen 'atomistically,' as a series of discrete objects," so as to move towards seeing it "'holistically,' as an interconnected web, in which what things are also depends on how we speak about them and act in relation to them and to each other" (p. 7). Music, of course, has a key role to play in the activation of this essentially hermeneutic cycling process of world-disclosure in which mine and thine begin to interpenetrate and open up into each other -- as, for example, when contemporary pragmatics comes to an understanding of itself in German continental philosophy, and vice versa. These privileged opportunities for opening up that are afforded by music are a response to, in Martha Nussbaum's words, "our urgent need for and attachment to things outside ourselves that we do not control" (p. 34). More importantly, historically this need becomes particularly acute for Bowie in the vertiginous condition of modernity where the auratic force of sovereignty and religion have waned, with the resultant effect that, to quote Marx's famous line from theCommunist Manifesto,"all that is solid melts into air." As with contemporary pragmatists like Rorty and also hermeneutics, Bowie is thus primarily concerned with the social justification of actions; similarly, he seeks to encourage the proliferation of conversations, if we conceive these broadly as anything that brings us into productive relationships with the world and others. He is interested in forms of "comprehensibility" that derive from "ways of coping with the world that transcend particular languages"; concerned with understanding "the power which music has to connect us to the world in many differing ways" (p. 148); consistent in his belief that there "are indefinitely many kinds of response to the world, from painting to dance, and so on, which can be appropriate in the right context" (p. 122). It is important for him to remind us repeatedly that "music matters because of the way it connects to, articulates, and evokes aspects of life which would not be accessible without the music itself and its immediate effects on its listeners" (p. 123). This particular ethical theme finds its final, and perhaps most moving, illustration in the book's conclusion in a discussion of the East-West Divan founded by Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said in 1999. The orchestra was conceived precisely so musicians from Israel and other Middle Eastern countries could play together. Here the act of musical performance itself -- another important theme in Bowie's book -- allows for the opening up and disclosing of a certain space usually obscured by the seemingly insurmountable political antagonisms cutting across the lines of communication and understanding in those troubled parts of the world.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarthy's study, written before TCA's publication, traces the development of Habermas' critical theory from his early epistemological writings through Knowledge and Human Interests and Legitimation Crisis. The book anticipates the Weberian themes that would become central to TCA, particularly Habermas' reformulation of the relationship between technical-instrumental and practical-communicative reason, and his critique of positivist social science. McCarthy's own formulation of "communicative competence" as a theoretical construct helps readers understand the specific theoretical intervention Habermas was making against a Weberian background.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the intellectual context for TCA's Weber engagement by tracing how the communicative rationality concept emerged in Habermas' earlier work. The book demonstrates that Habermas' departure from Weber's framework of purposive rationality was already underway before TCA and had roots in his theory of knowledge and human interests.

  POSITION: Pre-TCA intellectual biography; situates Habermas' Weber reception in the longer arc of his theoretical development and helps explain why the challenge to Weber's action typology was systematic rather than ad hoc.

  abstract = {William M. Paris’s first book makes wide-ranging and consequential interventions into contemporary critical theory, Africana philosophy, and critical philosophy of race. By situating careful studies of five key thinkers of black liberation within a synthetic critical framework of his own, Paris is able simultaneously to develop a compelling ‘utopian’ answer to critical theory’s ongoing search for the normative sources of social transformation, offer novel interpretations of his primary interlocutors as contributors to a tradition of utopian critical theory and practice, and illustrate the relevance of the social ontology of time to critical philosophy of race.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Utopia can be a tough sell. Paris’s first achievement is to have renovated the concept of utopia within a framework that builds on and synthesizes Rahel Jaeggi’s concept of forms of life, Ernst Bloch’s thinking on social temporality and asynchrony, and Rainer Forst’s theories of justification and power. A signal debate in Frankfurt critical theory over the last two generations has been about the normative sources of critique and social transformation. The prevailing position holds that critique must be immanent such that we can effectively criticize our societies by drawing on the insufficiency of norms or values already present within our social practices. Typically, immanent critique is mobilized against utopianism, which appears to appeal to ungrounded normative standards cooked up by the utopian imagination.

On Paris’s view, however, utopias are neither transcendent to our socio-historically located forms of life nor straightforwardly immanent to them. Instead, utopian critique and practice finds its normative sources in what Bloch had termed the “non-synchronous”, the unrealizedremaindersof past social struggles which can be intuitively accessed and provide anticipatory insight into social problems and their potential resolutions (46-49). The justification narratives of any given political hegemony involve a selective sedimentation of inheritances, predicated on suppressing counter-inheritances. Utopianism indexes a kind of critical estrangement from the narratively synchronous present through the re-activation of suppressed or ‘failed’ inheritances and their visions of the future.

The book’s second significant achievement is to figure modern racial domination as racial fetishism. Racial fetishism is a normatively laden practical stance or “social form of consciousness” (147), according to which race has an ‘as if’ reality. By distinguishing between racism and racial fetishism, Paris theorizes the practical persistence of racial domination after the debunking and widespread rejection of biological race theories. On Paris’s developed view, the racially differentiated, social organization of life chances and horizons of expectation appear, through the inverting prism of racial fetishism, to becaused by race,while it is actually a veiled effect of capital accumulation’s tendency to hierarchically differentiate the working class (20, 193-98). The utopian struggle against racial domination is consequently a struggle against the capitalist organization of social time in view of the overcoming of the inheritance of racial fetishism.

The primary themes of race, time, and utopia meet in the concept of non-synchrony, as black liberation struggle is interpreted as drawing its normative source from the non-synchrony of racialized life, which is both the anchor of racial dominationandthe cause of a normative “gap” that accounts for the distinctive ethical character of the struggles of the racially dominated. Over five chapters, Paris elucidates an increasingly concrete vision of the utopian politics of the non-synchronous as they are developed in the work of several major Africana figures.

The first chapter presents Paris’s model of social change and argues for the role of ‘utopian’ consciousness in transforming societies. Building on Jaeggi and Forst, Paris argues that social consciousness is always located relative to a form of life and its constrainedhorizons of normative and functional expectations.He contrasts this view with the “awareness model”, according to which it suffices for agents to be aware of and morally incensed by social injustices for them to be committed to social transformation, stressing the role of not only moral but alsopractical functionalnormativity in conditioning change.

On Paris’s view, social transformation requires a conjunction of four conditions: the advent of an objective crisis that disrupts practical life, the subjective experience of this disruption as a crisis in horizons of expectation, the emergence of a utopian consciousness that anticipates resolutions to objective crises, and finally, structural conditions that render the costs of remaining in crisis higher than the costs of attempting to break with the status quo and organize new institutions and forms of life. Paris convincingly demonstrates the explanatory value of this framework by applying it to the 2020 George Floyd uprising, arguing that while it involved both a genuine objective crisis and a timely synchronization of both crisis and utopian consciousness, projects to institutionally realize the utopian content of the uprising have remained tragically stalled amidst a broader crisis of “a social form of life in which few people believe” but lack “the structural capacity” to overhaul (54).

Paris turns, in the second chapter, to locate a more inchoate and fragile utopianism in W. E. B. Du Bois. Focusing primarily onThe Souls of Black Folk, Paris extracts a social ontology of time from Du Bois’ early work. Phenomenologically, the key Du Boisian concept of the ‘color line’ fractures the social experience of time as racially differentiated forms of life “become oriented toward divergent horizons of expectation” (81). Normatively, racialization and the historical experience of enslavement and struggle have rendered African Americans “non-synchronous with ‘Western’ civilization” and “disposed them toward a different vision of freedom than what was on offer from the broader society of the United States” (64).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schluchter reconstructs Weber's developmental-historical sociology of Western rationalism, arguing that Weber's account of rationalization is structured around the progressive differentiation and systematization of cultural value spheres. He provides a sympathetic but analytically rigorous account of Weber's rationalization thesis, including its relationship to neo-evolutionary thinking in Parsons and Habermas, arguing that Weber's framework, properly reconstructed, remains the most adequate model for explaining the distinctiveness of Western modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides an independent scholarly reconstruction of Weber's rationalization theory against which Habermas' reading can be assessed. Schluchter is particularly important because Habermas explicitly engages his reconstruction in TCA, making this text part of the immediate intellectual context of Habermas' Weber chapters.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Breen argues that Weber's diagnosis of modernity -- characterized by value conflict, bureaucratization, and the "iron cage" of formal rationality -- casts a long shadow over subsequent political thought. He examines Habermas as one of three major attempts to respond to this Weberian inheritance, arguing that Habermas' response through communicative rationality is "one-sided" because it privileges the intersubjective coordination of action through discourse while insufficiently theorizing the role of non-discursive social forces (power, affect, tradition) in constituting subjectivity and politics.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the research project's question of how Habermas positions himself relative to Weber and what he adopts and transforms. Breen's comparative approach (Habermas vs. Arendt vs. MacIntyre) is useful for understanding what is distinctive about Habermas' response to Weber as opposed to other possible responses.

  POSITION: Critical reading of Habermas' response to Weber from within political philosophy; argues the communicative-rationality solution underestimates the depth of the Weberian problematic it claims to resolve.

  CORE ARGUMENT: In this influential essay (originally a speech accepting the Adorno Prize, 1980), Habermas argues that modernity is an "unfinished project" in the sense that the potential for rational social organization implicit in Enlightenment thought has not been exhausted but only selectively realized. He uses Weber's differentiation of cultural value spheres (science, morality, art) as a descriptive framework but argues against Weber's pessimistic conclusion that further rationalization is meaningless or oppressive, insisting instead that reconnecting differentiated spheres to everyday communicative practice is still possible.

  RELEVANCE: One of Habermas' most accessible articulations of his relation to Weber's legacy: he accepts Weber's sociological description of cultural differentiation while rejecting the normative pessimism Weber drew from it. Directly relevant to the research project's concern with how Habermas uses Weber's historical sociology while resisting Weber's own "diagnosis of the times."

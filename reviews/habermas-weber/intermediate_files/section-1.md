## Section 1: Reconstructing Rationalization — What Habermas Takes from Weber and Why

Habermas' engagement with Max Weber in *The Theory of Communicative Action* (TCA) is not simply scholarly commentary but a constitutive element of his theoretical architecture. In the opening chapters of TCA Volume 1, Habermas accepts Weber's core sociological picture — the differentiation of cultural value spheres (science, morality, art), the formal rationalization of law and economy through the Protestant ethic, and the paradoxical character of rationalization processes that simultaneously promise freedom yet threaten an "iron cage" of bureaucratic domination (Habermas 1984). Yet Habermas argues that Weber's action-theoretic framework, built around purposive-rational action, renders communicative rationality theoretically invisible, and thereby prevents Weber from perceiving the full emancipatory potential immanent in modernity. Understanding what Habermas appropriates from Weber and what he transforms requires tracing both Weber's rationalization typology and the intellectual lineage through which Habermas inherits the Weber problem.

### 1.1 Weber's Rationalization Typology and Its Limits

Weber's theory of rationalization is more multi-dimensional than Habermas' critique sometimes acknowledges. Stephen Kalberg (1980) identifies four distinct types of rationality operative in Weber's sociology: practical rationality (everyday problem-solving oriented to self-interest), theoretical rationality (abstract conceptual mastery of reality through increasingly precise concepts), substantive rationality (value-governed action oriented to ultimate commitments), and formal rationality (means-end calculation according to universally applied rules). These types interact in complex ways across Weber's historical studies, particularly in his sociology of religion where Kalberg (1990) argues that rationalization proceeds through multiple pathways — prophetic ethical rationalization, theoretical systematization of worldviews, and practical routinization — rather than the single trajectory of formal rationalization that Habermas attributes to Weber.

Wolfgang Schluchter (1981) provides a developmental-historical reconstruction of Weber's rationalization thesis, arguing that Weber's account is structured around the progressive differentiation and systematization of cultural value spheres and their institutional embodiment in Western modernity. Schluchter emphasizes Weber's analysis of how value-rational orientations were institutionalized through the Protestant ethic into the formal rationality of capitalism and modern law, constituting a unified developmental account of Western rationalism.

These reconstructions reveal a tension at the heart of Habermas' Weber critique. If Weber's typology already distinguishes formal from substantive rationality and if his sociology of religion captures the multi-dimensional interplay of rationalization processes, then the charge that Weber reduces all rationality to purposive means-end calculation becomes difficult to sustain. Kalberg (1990) explicitly criticizes Habermas' reconstruction as incomplete and misleading alongside those of Tenbruck and Schluchter, arguing that Weber's framework is already more differentiated than the "one-dimensional" picture Habermas presents.

### 1.2 Habermas' Communicative Turn as Reconstruction of Weber

Habermas' response to this tension is to distinguish two analytically separable dimensions that Weber allegedly conflates: cultural rationalization (the differentiation of validity claims in worldviews, enabling decentered understanding) and societal rationalization (the institutional anchoring of rationality in action subsystems). In TCA Volume 1, Chapters II and III, Habermas argues that Weber's methodological starting point in purposive-rational action prevented him from theorizing communicative rationality — the intersubjective orientation to mutual understanding — as an equally fundamental dimension of modernity. The differentiation of cultural value spheres that Weber analyzed represents, for Habermas, a progressive cognitive development that opens up communicative potential by making distinct validity claims (truth, rightness, authenticity) explicit and criticizable. Yet this communicative dimension remains unrealized at the societal level because capitalist modernization has selectively institutionalized only the purposive-rational subsystems of market and bureaucracy while suppressing the communicative rationalization of the lifeworld (Habermas 1984).

David Ingram (1987) provides the most analytically detailed secondary account of this reconstruction, clarifying the logical structure of Habermas' argument: Weber's action-theoretic framework cannot ground normative standards for critique because it treats all value commitments as ultimately subjective preferences, leaving only the formal consistency of means-end calculation as a criterion of rationality. By contrast, the communicative rationality embedded in ordinary language use carries pragmatic presuppositions — the orientation to mutual understanding, the accountability to validity claims — that provide immanent normative resources. Ingram argues that Habermas' departure from Weber concerns primarily the normative grounding of social critique rather than the sociological content of the rationalization analysis itself.

In *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity*, Habermas (1987) situates Weber as a pivotal figure in the transition from philosophy to social theory as the primary site of reflection on modernity, characterizing Weber's rationalization thesis as the first systematic attempt to translate Hegel's philosophy of history into empirical-analytical terms. Peter Hohendahl (1985) traces how this positioning functions within Habermas' critique of the Frankfurt School: Adorno and Horkheimer's *Dialectic of Enlightenment* radicalized Weber's pessimistic diagnosis of formal rationalization while abandoning his sociological differentiation of rationality types, thereby leading critical theory into an aporia from which only the communicative turn could rescue it.

### 1.3 The "Weberian Marxism" Lineage

Habermas' need for Weber becomes clearer when situated within what Harry Dahms (1997) identifies as a "Weberian Marxism" tradition running from Georg Lukacs through the Frankfurt School to Habermas. Both Lukacs and Habermas, Dahms argues, appropriate Weber's rationalization thesis to mediate between Marx's political economy and a theory of cultural-ideological legitimation. Where Marx analyzed the commodity form and capital accumulation, Weber provided the missing link: an account of how rationalization processes transform consciousness, institutions, and lifeworld structures. Lukacs' reification theory fused Weber's formal rationalization with Marx's commodity fetishism, but grounded critique in proletarian class consciousness. Habermas' communicative reformulation differs by locating the normative standpoint in the pragmatic presuppositions of communicative action rather than in any particular class position, while retaining Weber's insight about the differentiation and autonomization of purposive-rational subsystems.

Darrow Schecter (2010) frames Habermas as the culmination of this lineage, arguing that the communicative turn represents both a genuine advance over Weber's pessimism and a significant accommodation to liberal proceduralism. Luca Corchia (2015) provides historical context for this divergence, showing that Habermas' critique of first-generation critical theory was already evident in his early work: his reassertion of the emancipatory agenda against Adorno and Horkheimer's retreat into negative dialectics required a fundamentally different relationship to Weber's legacy, one that could preserve the rationalization diagnosis while recovering normative resources for critique.

The Weberian Marxism framework clarifies why Habermas constructs his theory of communicative action through sustained engagement with Weber: the rationalization thesis provides the sociological foundation for diagnosing modernity's pathologies, while the communicative turn supplies what Weber's framework cannot — an account of how the differentiated rationality potentials of modernity remain available for democratic realization. Whether this reconstruction adequately captures Weber's insights or domesticates his tragic awareness of irreducible value conflict remains a contested question that shapes subsequent debates about Habermas' theory of modernity.

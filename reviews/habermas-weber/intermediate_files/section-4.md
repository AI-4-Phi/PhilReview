## Section 4: Methodological Legacy — Verstehen, Ideal Types, and Reconstructive Science

The Habermas-Weber relationship has a crucial but underexplored methodological dimension. Habermas inherits Weber's commitment to interpretive understanding (*Verstehen*) as essential to social science, yet he replaces Weber's value-freedom postulate with a "reconstructive science" that makes explicit the normative presuppositions embedded in communicative action. The critical question is whether this reconstructive methodology extends, transforms, or breaks with Weberian ideal-typical analysis. Two readings compete: the continuity thesis holds that Weber's ideal types already contain a hermeneutic dimension that Habermas radicalizes; the transformation thesis argues that rational reconstruction introduces a normatively charged third mode unavailable within Weber's value-free framework. This methodological departure from *Wertfreiheit* is what makes Habermas' quasi-evolutionary theory of rationalization possible—and contentious.

### 4.1 Weber's Methodological Legacy — Verstehen, Ideal Types, and Value-Freedom

Weber's interpretive sociology aimed to combine *Verstehen*—the understanding of meaningful social action—with causal explanation, an integration realized through ideal-typical analysis. Aronovitch (2011) defends Weber's ideal-type method as a coherent via media between hermeneutics and causal science: ideal types blend interpretive understanding with causal explanation without reducing either to the other, enabling rational appraisals of social phenomena while maintaining value pluralism. Shamsi (2024) argues that *Verstehen* functions not as an end in itself but as a tool for achieving objectivity in social science, working alongside ideal types to uncover the causal-intentional structures behind social action. However, Kedar (2007) offers a hermeneutic reconstruction of ideal types that challenges standard positivist readings. He contends that Weber's ideal types are fundamentally hermeneutic concepts structured by a logic of significance rather than commonality, with cases standing in Wittgensteinian family-resemblance relations rather than classificatory ones. If this hermeneutic reading is correct, Weber's ideal types already incorporate the interpretive dimension that Habermas claims to introduce, supporting a continuity thesis. Whimster (1995) similarly argues that Weber's emphasis on interpretation and value-relevance already contains resources for critique that resist purely instrumental rationality, making Weber's methodological commitments less positivist than Habermas suggests.

### 4.2 Habermas' Reconstructive Science — Transformation or Extension?

Habermas' mature methodology centers on "rational reconstruction," a distinctive mode that Pedersen (2008) characterizes as revealing the grammar of practical reason embedded in communicative practice—analogous to Chomskian linguistics uncovering the universal structures of linguistic competence. Pedersen argues that rational reconstruction operates neither inductively nor interpretively but as a third mode that makes explicit the universal competences presupposed in communicative action. Outhwaite (2014) frames reconstructive science as a genuine third mode beyond both positivism and hermeneutics, constituting Habermas' original methodological contribution distinct from his Weberian inheritance. Anicker (2025) analyzes Habermas' theoretical practice as a problem-centered combination of hermeneutic sensitivity—careful reconstruction of existing theories as responses to specific problems—with systematic integration of plural theoretical resources. This methodological practice, exemplified in Habermas' reading of Weber in *The Theory of Communicative Action* (Habermas 1984), operates precisely in the space between hermeneutic interpretation and systematic theory construction. Baynes (1989) argues that Habermas' model integrates rational reconstruction with social criticism, preserving interpretive understanding of meaning while adding a normative-reconstructive dimension that moves beyond the descriptive constraints of Weberian *Verstehen*. Yet a fundamental problem persists: as Pedersen notes, it remains unclear how to empirically test hypotheses generated through rational reconstruction, a tension that traces back to Habermas' departure from Weber's value-freedom. McCarthy (1991) examines the neo-Kantian foundations shared by Weber and Habermas, arguing that both struggle with how to ground social science in objective knowledge claims while acknowledging the role of values and interpretation—though this source is INCOMPLETE and conclusions must be drawn cautiously from available annotations rather than full abstract analysis.

### 4.3 Value-Freedom and the Normative Stakes

Habermas' 1973 postscript to *Knowledge and Human Interests* marks his decisive break with Weberian *Wertfreiheit*. Habermas distinguishes three knowledge-constitutive interests—technical, practical, and emancipatory—arguing that interpretive (hermeneutic) and critical-reconstructive interests are irreducible to the technical interest in prediction and control (Habermas and Lenhardt 1973). The practical interest corresponds to Weber's *Verstehen* tradition, but Habermas insists that a further emancipatory interest, absent in Weber, is required for critical social theory. This move represents a direct challenge to Weber's value-freedom postulate: Habermas argues that social science is constitutively normative because interpreting social action already involves rationally engaging with the validity claims raised in communicative practice. Wilson (1986) traces critical theory's evolution from Adorno's primarily negative ideological critique to Habermas' more constructive methodological program, showing how the attempt to found a non-positivist social science forced serious engagement with the Weberian tradition of interpretive sociology. The shift from negative to constructive methodology required Habermas to articulate not merely what was wrong with positivism and instrumental reason but what a reconstructive social science would positively accomplish. However, Verošvek (2022) offers a reconciliatory reading that questions whether Habermas' critique hits its mark: he argues that Habermas misreads Weber's value-freedom as ethical relativism, when Weber's methodological prescription was never the substantive ethical position Habermas critiques. According to Verošvek, Weber's political writings reveal normative commitments that Habermas overlooks, suggesting that the disagreement between Weber and Habermas may be less fundamental than Habermas' reconstruction suggests—both seek to preserve spaces for reasoned debate about values while acknowledging limits to rational adjudication.

The methodological departure from value-freedom enables Habermas' quasi-evolutionary reconstruction of Western rationalization but generates persistent tensions. Whether reconstructive science genuinely extends Weber's hermeneutic ideal-type method or represents an epistemological break remains contested. What is clear is that Habermas' claim that interpretive understanding is irreducibly normative transforms the terms of social-scientific methodology in ways that Weber's framework explicitly prohibited—with consequences that ramify throughout Habermas' theory of communicative action and its account of modernity.

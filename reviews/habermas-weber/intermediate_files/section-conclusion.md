## Conclusion

The secondary literature on Habermas' engagement with Weber can be periodized into three waves, each marked by distinct interpretive commitments and critical concerns. The first wave (1980s-1990s), dominated by commentaries on *The Theory of Communicative Action*, offered broadly favorable assessments of Habermas' reconstructive project. Ingram (1987) and McCarthy (1978) argued that Habermas successfully diagnosed Weber's "one-sidedness"—the reduction of rationality to purposive-rational calculation—and that the communicative turn provided normative resources for critique that Weber's subject-centered framework could not generate. This literature treated Habermas' appropriation of Weber as resolving the paradox that plagued first-generation Frankfurt School critical theory: how to ground normative critique without falling into instrumental reason's self-undermining logic.

A second wave (2000s-2010s) adopted a more skeptical stance. Breen (2012), Schecter (2010), and Owen (2002) argued that Habermas remains "under Weber's shadow," replicating rather than transcending core Weberian dualisms. Breen's comparative study contends that while Habermas successfully moves beyond Weber's monological subjectivism through intersubjectivity, this advance comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavor and domesticating Weber's tragic awareness of irreducible value conflict. The lifeworld/system distinction, rather than resolving Weber's rationalization paradox, may merely rename it at a higher level of abstraction.

A third wave (2015-present) reassesses the Habermas-Weber relationship in light of contemporary Weber studies. Etzrodt (2024) challenges the disenchantment-centered reading of Weber that critical theory inherited, arguing that Weber's rationalization processes are more complex and dialectical than Habermas acknowledges. Verošvek (2022) contends that Habermas constructs a "straw Weber" of ethical relativism to justify his own discourse ethics, missing Weber's more nuanced position on value-freedom. Prasai (2024), by contrast, offers a contemporary restatement of the Habermasian position, arguing that the colonization thesis successfully transforms Weber's catastrophist vision into a normative standard for critique. Conill-Sancho (2025) extends the debate to Habermas' recent genealogical work in *Also a History of Philosophy*, suggesting that Habermas' acceptance of the Weberian secularization thesis may be more limiting than earlier literature recognized.

Four tensions remain genuinely contested. First, whether Habermas' communicative rationality is immanent in modernity (as Habermas claims) or an externally imposed normative standard (as Weber scholars argue). Second, whether the colonization thesis adequately captures what is wrong with rationalization from the perspective of those affected; Jütten (2011) identifies a normative lacuna in Habermas' functionalist framing that cannot explain the first-person experience of reification. Third, whether the ontogenetic analogy that grounds Habermas' quasi-evolutionary account is sustainable; Strydom (1987) and Oh (2023) argue that individual developmental logic cannot be transferred to collective social learning without committing a category error. Fourth, whether Habermas' domestication of Weber's tragic dimension represents a cost of the communicative turn or a corrective to Weberian overstatement.

A notable gap persists: the relationship between Habermas' later work (post-*TCA*, especially *Between Facts and Norms* and *Also a History of Philosophy*) and Weber remains underexplored. Most secondary literature concentrates on *The Theory of Communicative Action*, treating it as Habermas' definitive statement on Weber. Yet Habermas continued to engage Weber's legacy throughout his career, and the periodization above suggests that scholarly assessment has evolved in tandem with broader shifts in Weber interpretation. The research contribution of attending carefully to all five dimensions identified in this review—rationalization and modernity, philosophy of history, method, critiques and departures, and the secondary debate itself—illuminates a systematic relationship that literature treating these questions piecemeal has tended to fragment.

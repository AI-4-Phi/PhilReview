====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The secondary literature examining Habermas' intellectual relationship with Weber falls into several distinct periods and interpretive positions. Early scholarship (1980s-1990s) focused primarily on Habermas' use of Weber in The Theory of Communicative Action, examining whether Habermas' critique of Weber's rationalization thesis was fair and whether his communicative turn successfully overcame Weberian pessimism about modernity. Key interventions in this period include David Ingram's Habermas and the Dialectic of Reason (1987) and George McCarthy's methodological critiques. A second wave (2000s-2010s) took a more comparative approach, situating both thinkers within broader traditions—Keith Breen's Under Weber's Shadow (2012) examines how Habermas, Arendt, and MacIntyre each respond to Weber's diagnosis of modernity, while Darrow Schecter traces the critique of instrumental reason from Weber through the Frankfurt School to Habermas. Recent scholarship (2015-present) has reassessed Habermas' reading in light of contemporary Weber interpretation, questioning whether Habermas adequately grasped Weber's value pluralism and political theory. A persistent debate concerns whether Habermas' emphasis on communicative rationality successfully escapes Weber's iron cage or merely replicates its limitations in a different register.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the essential scholarly conversation about how Habermas reads, appropriates, and transforms Weber. These secondary sources offer critical assessments of Habermas' fidelity to Weber's texts, identify points where Habermas' reconstruction diverges from or misreads Weber, and evaluate whether Habermas' theoretical moves (communicative rationality, lifeworld/system distinction, discourse ethics) successfully address the problems Weber diagnosed. This literature is crucial for understanding the contested nature of Habermas' Weber interpretation and for identifying ongoing debates about the relationship between critical theory and Weberian sociology.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
There is limited recent (post-2015) Anglophone scholarship that systematically reassesses Habermas' Weber interpretation in light of contemporary Weber studies. German-language scholarship on this relationship appears richer but is underrepresented in accessible databases. The relationship between Habermas' later work (post-TCA) and Weber also remains underexplored—most secondary literature focuses on the 1981 Theory of Communicative Action rather than tracing how Habermas' engagement with Weber evolved.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this literature, distinguish between (1) scholarship that evaluates Habermas' interpretive fidelity to Weber, (2) scholarship that uses the Habermas-Weber comparison to advance independent theoretical positions, and (3) scholarship that situates both thinkers within broader intellectual traditions (Frankfurt School, neo-Kantianism, pragmatism). Pay attention to shifts across the three periods identified above, and note how Weber scholars versus Habermas scholars approach the relationship differently.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Habermas successfully overcomes Weber: 4 papers - Habermas' communicative turn resolves Weber's paradoxes of rationalization
- Habermas misreads or oversimplifies Weber: 5 papers - Habermas reduces Weber's value pluralism and political realism to instrumentalism
- Habermas remains under Weber's shadow: 6 papers - Despite efforts to escape, Habermas replicates Weber's core diagnoses
- Both thinkers require synthesis with other traditions: 2 papers - Neither Weber nor Habermas alone provides adequate resources for critical theory

  doi = {10.4324/9781315549316},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Breen argues that Habermas, Arendt, and MacIntyre each take Weber's diagnosis of modernity as their starting point—the view that rationalization and disenchantment promise freedom yet threaten the "iron cage" of instrumental reason—but reject his pessimistic conclusions by developing alternative, intersubjective conceptions of subjectivity, ethics, and politics. However, Breen contends that while these thinkers successfully move beyond Weber's monological view of the self and his subjectivism, they do so at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human life and neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation that Weber emphasized.

  RELEVANCE: This book is essential for understanding how Habermas' response to Weber compares with other major 20th-century attempts to overcome Weberian pessimism. Breen's critique that Habermas depoliticizes certain domains despite claiming to radicalize democracy speaks directly to debates about whether communicative action theory adequately addresses Weber's concerns about power and domination in modern societies. The comparative framework illuminates what is distinctive about Habermas' appropriation versus other post-Weberian trajectories.

  POSITION: Represents the "under Weber's shadow" position—argues that despite efforts to transcend Weber, contemporary theorists including Habermas remain constrained by the terms of Weber's diagnosis.

  abstract = {Under Weber's Shadow presents an extended critical evaluation of the social and political thought of Jürgen Habermas, Hannah Arendt and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although hailing from very different philosophical traditions, these theorists all take as their starting-point Max Weber's seminal diagnosis of late modernity, the view that the world-historic processes of rationalization and disenchantment are paradoxical in promising freedom yet threatening servitude under the 'iron cage' of instrumental reason. However, each rejects his pessimistic understanding of the grounds and possibilities of political life, accusing him of complicity in the very realities he sought to resist. Seeking to move beyond Weber's monological view of the self, his subjectivism and his identification of the political with domination, they offer alternative, intersubjective conceptions of the subject, ethics and politics that allow for positive future possibilities. But this incontrovertible gain, it is argued, comes at the cost of depoliticizing key arenas of human endeavour and of neglecting the reality of struggle and contestation. Engaging with important current debates and literature, Keith Breen provides a rigorous analysis of the work of Habermas, Arendt, MacIntyre and Weber and a highly accessible and original intervention within contemporary social and political thought. Under Weber's Shadow will therefore be of interest to students and researchers alike within the areas of social and political theory, as well as those within the disciplines of ethics, sociology and philosophy.},

  doi = {10.12987/9780300156898},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ingram provides a comprehensive reconstruction of Habermas' critical theory from Knowledge and Human Interests through The Theory of Communicative Action, arguing that Habermas develops a distinctive dialectical approach that synthesizes Weber's rationalization thesis with Marx's critique of capitalism and Lukács' theory of reification. Ingram contends that Habermas' communicative turn successfully resolves the paradox that plagued first-generation Frankfurt School critical theory: how to ground normative critique without falling into relativism or instrumental reason's self-undermining logic.

  RELEVANCE: This early comprehensive study established the interpretive framework for understanding Habermas' relationship to Weber that dominated scholarship in the 1980s-1990s. Ingram's argument that Habermas successfully overcomes Weber's pessimism through communicative rationality represents the optimistic reading of Habermas' project, which later scholars would critique. The book is crucial for understanding how Habermas' Weber interpretation was initially received and how it connects to broader Frankfurt School debates about rationalization and reification.

  POSITION: Represents the "Habermas successfully overcomes Weber" position—argues that communicative action theory resolves Weber's paradoxes.

  title = {The Comedy of Enlightenment: Weber, Habermas, and the Critique of Reification},
  booktitle = {The Barbarism of Reason: Max Weber and the Twilight of Enlightenment},
  editor = {Horowitz, Asher and Maley, Terry},
  year = {1994},
  publisher = {University of Toronto Press},
  address = {Buffalo},
  pages = {188--210},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Horowitz argues that Habermas' attempt to overcome Weber's pessimism about rationalization through communicative action inadvertently replicates the very problem it seeks to solve. By distinguishing communicative from instrumental rationality, Habermas preserves rather than resolves the dichotomy between reason and meaning that Weber identified. The essay contends that Habermas' solution is "comic" in the technical sense—it promises reconciliation through a theoretical move that leaves the underlying structural contradictions intact.

  RELEVANCE: This essay provides a sharp critique of the dominant interpretation that Habermas successfully moves beyond Weber. Horowitz's argument that Habermas replicates Weber's dualism at a higher level of abstraction challenges the optimistic reading of communicative action theory and raises fundamental questions about whether any theory can escape the iron cage through conceptual innovation alone. The piece speaks directly to debates about whether Habermas' lifeworld/system distinction merely renames rather than resolves Weber's rationalization paradox.

  POSITION: Represents the "Habermas remains under Weber's shadow" position—argues that communicative action theory replicates rather than transcends Weber's diagnoses.

  editor = {Manninen, Juha and Tuomela, Raimo},
  year = {1991},
  publisher = {Brill},
  address = {Leiden},
  pages = {145--176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarthy examines the methodological foundations of Weber's sociology and Habermas' critical theory, arguing that both theorists struggle with the same neo-Kantian problem: how to ground social science in objective knowledge claims while acknowledging the role of values and interpretation. McCarthy contends that Habermas' discourse ethics and theory of communicative action attempt to resolve this tension through an intersubjective conception of rationality, but that this move imports problems from Weber's value-pluralism that Habermas does not adequately address—specifically, the question of how competing validity claims can be rationally adjudicated when fundamental values conflict.

  RELEVANCE: This essay is crucial for understanding the methodological dimension of the Habermas-Weber relationship, which is often overshadowed by substantive debates about modernity and rationalization. McCarthy's focus on the Methodenstreit tradition shows how both thinkers inherit and respond to distinctively German debates about objectivity, value-freedom, and the status of normative claims in social science. The argument that Habermas' communicative rationality does not fully resolve Weber's value-pluralism challenges is important for assessing Habermas' claim to have overcome relativism.

  POSITION: Represents the "Habermas misreads Weber" position—argues that Habermas underestimates Weber's methodological sophistication and value-pluralism.

@book{schecter2010critique,
  author = {Schecter, Darrow},
  title = {The Critique of Instrumental Reason from Weber to Habermas},
  year = {2010},
  publisher = {Continuum},
  address = {London},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schecter traces the development of the critique of instrumental reason from Weber's rationalization thesis through Lukács, the Frankfurt School, to Habermas' theory of communicative action. He argues that while Habermas makes important advances in distinguishing different forms of rationality and grounding normative critique, the communicative action framework remains vulnerable to the same problem that plagued Weber: the difficulty of articulating substantive values that can resist the systemic imperatives of capitalism and bureaucracy. Schecter contends that Habermas' proceduralism, while theoretically sophisticated, offers insufficient resources for challenging the dominance of instrumental rationality in practice.

  RELEVANCE: This book provides essential context for understanding how Habermas' Weber interpretation fits within the broader Frankfurt School tradition of engaging with Weber. Schecter's argument that the critique of instrumental reason faces persistent structural limits—from Weber through Habermas—raises important questions about whether any version of critical theory can adequately address the problems Weber diagnosed without developing a more robust account of substantive rationality. The book connects the Habermas-Weber relationship to debates about the limits of procedural ethics and deliberative democracy.

  POSITION: Represents a nuanced "both thinkers have limitations" position—acknowledges Habermas' advances over Weber while identifying persistent problems in the critical theory tradition.

@article{salam2015habermas,

  title = {Habermas vs. Weber on Democracy},
  journal = {National Affairs},
  year = {2015},
  number = {25},
  pages = {143--156},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Salam argues that Habermas' democratic theory, which seeks to rescue modern life from the economic and bureaucratic compulsion Weber saw as inescapable, relies on assumptions about citizen competence and public transparency that Weber's more realistic account shows to be untenable. Habermas overlooks the opacity of interests under complex modern conditions and the difficulty of knowing what the state is doing, let alone judging whether it serves the public good. These sources of public ignorance, Salam contends, vindicate Weber's pessimistic understanding of democracy over Habermas' deliberative ideal.

  RELEVANCE: This essay offers a contemporary political theory perspective on the Habermas-Weber debate, focusing specifically on democratic theory rather than broader questions of modernity and rationalization. Salam's Weber-inspired critique of Habermasian deliberative democracy connects to current debates about populism, technocracy, and epistemic democracy. The argument that Habermas' proceduralism masks rather than addresses the autonomy of state officials and opinion leaders challenges the practical viability of discourse ethics in modern mass democracies.

  POSITION: Represents the "Habermas misreads Weber" position—argues that Weber's political realism better captures the constraints on democratic deliberation than Habermas' idealized communicative model.

  number = {1},
  pages = {125--149},
  doi = {10.1163/156916496X00103},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ingram examines how both Weber and Habermas understand the role of aesthetic experience in relation to rationalization, arguing that while Weber saw aesthetic culture as one sphere differentiated by modernity (alongside science and morality), Habermas initially underestimated aesthetic rationality's potential to mediate between instrumental and communicative reason. Ingram traces Habermas' evolving position from The Theory of Communicative Action through The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, showing how Habermas gradually recognizes aesthetic experience as offering resources for critique that his earlier work neglected.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses an often-overlooked dimension of the Habermas-Weber relationship: their respective understandings of art and aesthetic rationality. Ingram's argument that Habermas initially followed Weber too closely in treating aesthetic experience as a separate sphere, only later recognizing its mediating potential, illuminates how Habermas' engagement with Weber evolved beyond The Theory of Communicative Action. This is important for the research project's interest in how Habermas both appropriates and departs from Weber.

  POSITION: Traces Habermas' evolving relationship to Weber on aesthetics—from close alignment to critical distance.

  number = {3},
  pages = {181--214},
  doi = {10.1111/0735-2751.00033},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dahms analyzes how both Lukács and Habermas develop critical social theories by synthesizing Weber and Marx, arguing that both theorists use Weber's rationalization thesis as a framework for updating Marx's critique of capitalism for the 20th century. However, Dahms contends that while Lukács remained closer to Marx's substantive critique of alienation and reification, Habermas' communicative turn moves toward a procedural conception of critique that sacrifices the concrete analysis of capitalist social relations that made Weber-informed Marxism powerful in Lukács' hands.

  RELEVANCE: This article situates Habermas' Weber appropriation within the broader tradition of "Weberian Marxism" that includes Lukács, the Frankfurt School, and others who sought to synthesize Weber's diagnosis of rationalization with Marx's critique of capitalism. Dahms' argument that Habermas' proceduralism represents a retreat from the substantive critical potential of Weberian Marxism raises important questions about what is gained and lost in Habermas' reconstruction of critical theory. The piece is valuable for understanding how different ways of appropriating Weber lead to different critical-theoretical trajectories.

  POSITION: Critical of Habermas' departure from substantive Weberian Marxism toward proceduralism.

As an alternative, a notion of contingent social closure argues that relaxing the modernizationist assumptions of a single transition from estate to status/class increases the comparative-historical sensitivity of research on social structure, inequality, and stratification.

  volume = {8},
  number = {1},
  pages = {58--84},
  doi = {10.2307/202639},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kalberg provides a systematic reconstruction of Weber's concept of rationalization, distinguishing four distinct types: practical, theoretical, substantive, and formal rationalization. He argues that most interpreters, including Habermas, have focused too narrowly on formal rationalization (means-ends calculation) and have thus missed the complexity of Weber's account, particularly the role of substantive rationality (value-oriented action) and the tensions between different types. Kalberg contends that a proper understanding of Weber's multidimensional conception of rationalization calls into question simplistic narratives about the dominance of instrumental reason.

  RELEVANCE: While not primarily focused on Habermas, Kalberg's influential reconstruction of Weber's rationalization thesis has major implications for assessing Habermas' reading. If Kalberg is right that Weber distinguished multiple types of rationalization in tension with each other, then Habermas' characterization of Weber as reducing rationalization to instrumental reason appears as a significant misreading. This article is crucial for understanding contemporary Weber scholarship's challenge to Habermas' interpretation and for the research project's interest in whether Habermas faithfully represents Weber.

  volume = {85},
  number = {3},
  pages = {1013--1014},
  doi = {10.2307/1963919},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scaff examines Weber's attempt to preserve spaces for meaningful action and cultural creativity within the constraints of modern rationalization, arguing that Weber's political writings and essays on culture reveal a more complex and dialectical understanding of modernity than the pessimistic "iron cage" thesis suggests. Scaff contends that Weber saw possibilities for value-creation and political leadership that could resist or redirect rationalization's imperatives, a dimension of Weber's thought that Habermas and other critical theorists underestimate.

  RELEVANCE: Scaff's interpretation challenges the standard critical theory reading of Weber as a pure pessimist about modernity, suggesting that Weber himself articulated resources for critique and resistance that Habermas claims to move beyond Weber to achieve. This has implications for assessing whether Habermas' communicative turn is necessary to overcome Weberian fatalism or whether Weber's own thought already contains the critical resources Habermas seeks. The article contributes to debates about interpretive fidelity and whether Habermas constructs a "straw Weber" to legitimate his own theoretical moves.

  POSITION: Defends Weber's complexity against simplifying critical theory readings, implicitly critiquing Habermas' interpretation.

  year = {1996},
  publisher = {Stanford University Press},
  address = {Stanford, CA},
  translator = {Robertson, Neil},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schluchter provides a comprehensive reconstruction of Weber's theory of modernity, arguing that Weber understood rationalization as producing genuine paradoxes rather than simple contradictions—modernity simultaneously increases human control over nature and social life while generating new forms of constraint and loss of meaning. Schluchter contends that Weber's conception of value-pluralism and the conflict between value-spheres is more radical than Habermas acknowledges, making Habermas' attempt to ground normative critique in communicative rationality appear as a retreat from Weber's insights into the irreducible conflicts of modern life.

  RELEVANCE: Schluchter is one of the most important contemporary Weber scholars, and this book represents a major statement of how Weber should be read in light of critical theory's appropriations. His argument that Habermas underestimates Weber's value-pluralism and thus oversimplifies the problems of modernity has been influential in Weber studies' skepticism about Habermasian reconstructions. The book is essential for understanding the German scholarly conversation about Weber and critical theory that parallels but diverges from Anglophone discussions.

  POSITION: Represents Weber scholarship's critique of Habermas—argues that Habermas' reading flattens Weber's insights into irreducible value-conflicts.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Whimster examines Weber's interpretive sociology (Verstehen) and its relationship to instrumental reason, arguing that Weber's methodological commitments to understanding meaningful action provide resources for critique that Habermas overlooks. Whimster contends that Weber's emphasis on interpretation and value-relevance already contains an alternative to purely instrumental rationality, making Habermas' claim to transcend Weber through communicative action less revolutionary than Habermas suggests. The article shows how Weber's methodology implicitly contains normative dimensions that his explicit value-freedom doctrine obscures.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses the methodological foundations of both Weber's and Habermas' projects, arguing that Habermas misses how Weber's interpretive sociology already resists the dominance of instrumental reason. Whimster's argument connects to debates about whether Habermas constructs a one-sided Weber focused on formal rationalization while neglecting Weber's hermeneutic commitments. The piece is important for understanding how different readings of Weber's methodology lead to different assessments of what Habermas needs to move beyond.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bernstein critiques Habermas' interpretation of Weber and the Frankfurt School, arguing that Habermas' communicative turn involves a problematic separation of the social from the ethical that Weber and Adorno avoided. By distinguishing system from lifeworld and instrumental from communicative rationality, Habermas creates conceptual boundaries that allow systemic domination to proceed unchallenged in the economic and administrative spheres. Bernstein contends that Adorno's negative dialectics and Weber's value-pluralism both recognize that critique must engage with the substantive content of social life rather than retreating to procedural norms.

  RELEVANCE: This article offers a distinctive critique of Habermas from within the Frankfurt School tradition, arguing that Habermas misreads both Weber and Adorno by imposing a dualism between system and lifeworld that neither theorist accepted. Bernstein's argument that Habermas' proceduralism represents a retreat from substantive critique connects to broader debates about whether communicative action theory adequately addresses the problems of capitalism and bureaucracy that Weber diagnosed.

Moreover, I argue that Derrida’s deconstruction of the two paths of ‘reading’ - inversion and subversion - may be applied to the question of revolutionary politics, to show that revolution often culminates in the reaffirmation of authority. Derrida navigates a path between these two strategies, allowing one to formulate philosophical and political strategies that work at the limits of discourse, thereby pointing to an outside.

  number = {1},
  pages = {3--28},
  doi = {10.1177/1468795X231175635},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Etzrodt analyzes competing interpretations of Weber's rationalization thesis, distinguishing between readings that emphasize disenchantment (loss of meaning), alienation (Marxist appropriations), or anomie (Durkheimian framings). He argues that most interpreters, including Habermas, have treated disenchantment as Weber's central theme, but careful analysis of Weber's texts reveals that rationalization processes produce both disenchantment and new forms of meaning-creation. Etzrodt contends that the disenchantment reading popularized by Habermas and other critical theorists oversimplifies Weber's more dialectical account.

  RELEVANCE: This recent article represents contemporary Weber scholarship's reassessment of how critical theory has interpreted Weber. Etzrodt's argument that the disenchantment reading is an interpretive construction rather than Weber's actual position challenges a premise central to Habermas' appropriation. The article is important for understanding how current Weber studies questions the critical theory tradition's dominant interpretation, with implications for assessing whether Habermas' communicative turn responds to Weber's actual diagnosis or to a simplified version.

  number = {3},
  pages = {367--384},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.00291},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Owen examines how Habermas reconstructs the Western Marxist tradition (including Lukács and the Frankfurt School) through selective appropriation of Weber, arguing that Habermas uses Weber's rationalization thesis to update Marx's critique of capitalism for late modernity but in doing so abandons the totalizing critique of capitalism that characterized earlier Western Marxism. Owen contends that Habermas' lifeworld/system distinction, which draws on Weber's differentiation of value-spheres, allows him to accept capitalist markets as legitimate in their proper domain while critiquing their colonization of the lifeworld—a position Weber scholarship shows Weber himself would have rejected as naïve.

  RELEVANCE: This article connects Habermas' Weber interpretation to his broader reconstruction of Marxism and critical theory, showing how the Weber appropriation serves Habermas' project of developing a "post-Marxist" critical theory. Owen's argument that Habermas' use of Weber leads to an insufficiently critical stance toward capitalism challenges the claim that communicative action theory successfully updates critical theory for late modernity. The piece is important for understanding the political stakes of how Habermas reads Weber.

  POSITION: Critiques Habermas' Weber appropriation for leading to accommodation with capitalism rather than radical critique.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Delanty argues that Habermas' appropriation of Weber's rationalization thesis as a specifically occidental development creates problems for Habermas' claims to moral universalism. By grounding communicative rationality in the historical unfolding of Western rationalization, Habermas inherits from Weber a Eurocentric framework that contradicts his own universalist aspirations. Delanty contends that Habermas never adequately resolves the tension between the historical particularity of Western rationalization and the universal validity claims of discourse ethics.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses an often-overlooked dimension of Habermas' Weber inheritance: the problem of Eurocentrism and cultural particularity. Delanty's argument that Habermas' use of Weber's occidentalism undermines his universalism connects to contemporary debates about critical theory's relationship to colonialism and cultural diversity. The piece is important for the research project's interest in how Habermas both adopts and departs from Weber—here, Delanty argues that Habermas insufficiently distances himself from Weber's occidentalist framework.

  POSITION: Critiques Habermas for insufficiently addressing the Eurocentric implications of Weber's rationalization thesis.

  abstract = {Status characteristics theory predicts the emergence and structure of power and prestige orders in task groups from members' status attributes. This paper argues that application of the burden of proof assumption, central to the theory, is inconsistent with a key concept, generalized expectation state. A reformulation is proposed that eliminates the inconsistency and gives competing predictions for a wide range of situations. The reformulation predicts that, when not directly relevant to task performance, specific characteristics (e.g., athletic or analytical ability) have less impact than diffuse characteristics (race, gender, or education) on performance expectations. The original formulation predicts equal effects. Critical tests are proposed and the paper concludes with additional comparisons of the two formulations on the grounds of parsimony and implications for intervention in settings characterized by status-based inequalities.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Verošvek reexamines Habermas' critique of Weber's value-freedom doctrine, arguing that Habermas misreads Weber's distinction between facts and values as endorsing ethical relativism. Verošvek contends that Weber's value-freedom was a methodological prescription for social science rather than a substantive ethical position, and that Weber's political writings reveal normative commitments that Habermas overlooks. By reconstructing Weber more carefully, Verošvek argues that the disagreement between Weber and Habermas is less fundamental than Habermas suggests—both seek to preserve spaces for reasoned debate about values while acknowledging the limits of rational adjudication.

  RELEVANCE: This recent article represents a new wave of scholarship that seeks to reconcile Habermas and Weber by showing that their apparent disagreements rest on misreadings. Verošvek's argument that Habermas constructs a "straw Weber" of ethical relativism to justify his own discourse ethics has implications for assessing whether Habermas' theoretical innovations are necessary responses to Weber's limitations or solutions to problems Weber did not actually have. The article contributes to debates about interpretive fidelity central to the research project.

  POSITION: Reconciliatory—argues that Habermas and Weber are closer than Habermas' reading suggests, and that careful interpretation reduces the apparent conflict.

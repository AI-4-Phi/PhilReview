Jürgen Habermas' engagement with Max Weber is not an incidental scholarly episode but a constitutive element of his theoretical architecture. Weber functions as both resource and foil throughout Habermas' mature work, most extensively in *The Theory of Communicative Action* (Habermas 1984, 1987) but also in *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* (Habermas 1987) and earlier essays. This relationship structures Habermas' account of modernity, rationalization, and the pathologies of modern social life: Weber provides the empirical-sociological backbone for Habermas' diagnosis, yet Weber's own conclusions—the iron cage of bureaucratic rationality, the polytheism of values, and the imperative of value-freedom—are precisely what Habermas' theory of communicative rationality is designed to supersede.

Habermas makes three core moves in appropriating and transforming Weber's legacy. First, he appropriates Weber's multi-dimensional concept of rationality while expanding it beyond the purposive-rational. Habermas argues that Weber's framework, though it recognizes formal, substantive, value-rational, and practical dimensions of rationality, remains structurally biased toward purposive-rational action oriented to success. Against this, Habermas introduces communicative rationality—the rationality embedded in ordinary language and oriented toward mutual understanding—as a dimension Weber could not adequately theorize given his monological action framework (Habermas 1984). Second, Habermas criticizes Weber's account of societal rationalization as "selective": capitalism and bureaucracy rationalize system integration (coordinated by money and power) while suppressing the communicative rationalization of the lifeworld. The pathologies Weber diagnosed—loss of meaning, loss of freedom—are thus reinterpreted not as inevitable consequences of rationalization as such but as symptoms of this selective, asymmetric process (Habermas 1987). Third, Habermas repositions Weber within the Frankfurt School lineage, arguing that Adorno and Horkheimer's *Dialectic of Enlightenment* radicalized Weber's pessimistic diagnosis while abandoning his sociological differentiation of rationality types, thereby leading critical theory into the cul-de-sac of negative dialectics (Hohendahl 1985). Habermas' communicative turn is intended to rescue critical theory from this impasse by recovering the normative resources Weber himself made visible but could not access.

Habermas is not the first to place Weber and Marx in dialogue. As Dahms (1997) traces, a "Weberian Marxism" runs from Georg Lukács' reification theory through the Frankfurt School to Habermas' own synthesis. Lukács had already attempted to fuse Weber's rationalization thesis with Marx's critique of capitalism, identifying formal rationalization with reification and treating both as structural features of capitalist modernity. Habermas inherits this project but transforms it: where Lukács saw rationalization and reification as coextensive, Habermas distinguishes communicative from strategic rationalization, allowing him to reconstruct rather than reject Weber's framework (Dahms 1997). This situates *The Theory of Communicative Action*'s Weber chapters within a longer intellectual genealogy, clarifying what is continuous and what is novel in Habermas' appropriation.

This review examines Habermas' engagement with Weber across four substantive domains. The first addresses rationalization and modernity: how Habermas reconstructs Weber's account of cultural differentiation and disenchantment through the lens of communicative rationality, and whether this reconstruction captures or domesticates Weber's tragic diagnosis. The second examines the colonization thesis and the iron cage: whether Habermas' reformulation of Weber's "paradox of rationalization" through the system-lifeworld distinction adequately explains the pathologies of modern social life. The third explores Habermas' use of Weber's philosophy of history: how the rationalization narrative functions as a quasi-evolutionary developmental logic in Habermas' hands, and whether this transforms Weber's historical sociology beyond recognition. The fourth investigates methodology: how Habermas inherits and revises Weber's interpretive sociology, particularly the relationship between Verstehen, action types, and the normative grounds of social critique. Across these domains, the central question remains whether Habermas' communicative reconstruction of Weber represents a productive extension or a fundamental distortion of Weber's insights into the modern condition.

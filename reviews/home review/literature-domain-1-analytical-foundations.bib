  note      = {Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Queen's University. Accessible philosophical treatment of concept of home. While home might seem like readily understood concept and source of universally positive feelings, on closer investigation, neither assumption is true. Concept of home is constructed differently by different languages; dwellings are built and lived in very differently by diverse groups; and many individuals have negative or mixed emotions regarding their experiences of home life. Home has always been gathering place, shelter, and sanctuary, providing escape from busyness and intrusiveness of world. Home has been treasured and longed for as anchor of our existence.}

Challenges idea that philosophical thinking happens in city. House is not merely physical space but moral phenomenon that shapes our relationships and experiences. Explores transformative power of domestic spaces, particularly kitchen, as sites of personal and cosmic metamorphosis. Reviewed in Housing Studies 2024. Research into housing has historically neglected philosophy but this is changing with dedicated scholarship.}

Aristotle's distinction between public sphere of politics (polis) and private or domestic sphere of family (oikos) is starting point for philosophical discussions of privacy. Although there has been persistent concern for domestic privacy throughout history and across many cultures, in philosophical theory there remains research-gap between Aristotle's theory and classical liberal theory. No single definition, analysis or meaning of term privacy in ordinary language or in philosophical, political and legal discourse. Grounded in psychological and social constructs, need for privacy is reflected in human socio-spatial behaviour and in our own home. Essential for understanding home as private sphere.}

# Literature Review Synthesis Outline
## Philosophical Perspectives on "Home" for Encyclopedia Article

**Target Length**: 3500-4000 words
**Structure**: 6 main sections + introduction + conclusion
**Emphasis**: Analytical philosophy, applied ethics, key debates, research gaps

---

## Section 1: Introduction (300-350 words)

**Purpose**: Frame philosophical inquiry into home; establish scope and approach

**Key points**:
- Why "home" matters philosophically: intersection of ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics
- Analytical vs. phenomenological approaches (emphasize analytical; acknowledge but don't elaborate on continental)
- Post-1990 renaissance in philosophical engagement with home
- Roadmap of review: conceptual foundations, homelessness ethics, housing justice, feminist critiques, displacement, urban ethics

**Relevant BibTeX files**:
- literature-domain-1-analytical-foundations.bib

**Citations to emphasize**:
- Jenkins & Brownlee (2022) on philosophical neglect of home's social functions
- Fox (2016) or Coccia (2024) on complexity of home concept

---

## Section 2: Conceptual Foundations - What is "Home"? (500-600 words)

**Purpose**: Establish analytical framework; distinguish home from house, dwelling, shelter

**Key debates**:
1. Home vs. house distinction: physical structure vs. meaningful place
2. Necessary and sufficient conditions for "home"
3. Legal vs. social conceptions (Essert vs. Jenkins & Brownlee)
4. Home as property vs. home as social/psychological phenomenon

**Structure**:
- Conceptual ladder: shelter → housing → home (Jenkins & Brownlee 2022)
- Legal conception: home as property rights (Essert 2016, 2022)
- Social conception: home as meeting social needs, belonging, meaningful control
- Critique: neither conception alone sufficient; complementary insights

**Research gap identified**:
- Need for integrated conception combining legal/property and social/psychological dimensions
- Under-theorized: home as site of vulnerability alongside security

**Relevant BibTeX files**:
- literature-domain-1-analytical-foundations.bib
- literature-domain-2-homelessness-ethics.bib (Essert, Jenkins & Brownlee)

**Target word count**: 550 words

## Section 3: Homelessness Ethics - A Foundational Debate (600-700 words)

**Purpose**: Examine canonical philosophical work on homelessness; establish centrality to philosophy of home

**Key debates**:
1. Freedom-based accounts: Waldron's canonical argument
2. Property rights vs. access to shelter
3. Minimalism concerns in freedom-based accounts
4. Distributive justice vs. structural/property approaches

**Structure**:
- Waldron (1991): homeless are free only to extent society is communist; property rules constrain basic freedoms
- Essert (2016): homelessness as lack of property rights, not just distributional problem
- Wells (2022): autonomy-based account addressing minimalism concerns
- Integration: what obligations do we owe to homeless persons?

**Critical tensions**:
- Property absolutism vs. housing rights
- Negative liberty (Waldron) vs. positive rights approaches
- Individual vs. structural solutions

**Research gaps**:
- Limited engagement with actual experiences of homelessness
- Need for empirically-informed philosophical analysis

**Relevant BibTeX files**:
- literature-domain-2-homelessness-ethics.bib
- literature-domain-3-housing-justice.bib (connections to housing rights)

**Target word count**: 650 words

## Section 4: Housing Justice and Distributive Justice (650-750 words)

**Purpose**: Examine how distributive justice theories apply to housing; connect to broader debates

**Key debates**:
1. Is there a right to housing? On what grounds?
2. Capabilities approach vs. sufficientarian vs. egalitarian frameworks
3. Housing limitarianism: upper limits on housing wealth
4. Property rights vs. housing access (libertarian vs. egalitarian)

**Structure**:
- Sufficientarian approaches: guaranteed minimum, basic needs (Nussbaum capabilities)
- Capabilities approach to housing justice (Dummer 2025, Kimhur 2022)
- Limitations: vague thresholds, Western bias, insufficient for housing justice without relational egalitarianism
- Housing limitarianism (Erck 2024): what's wrong with excess housing?
- Property theory tensions: Waldron on property, left-libertarian vs. right-libertarian

**Critical analysis**:
- Capabilities approach alone insufficient (Dummer 2025)
- Need to integrate multiple frameworks
- Under-discussed in mainstream political philosophy (note research gap)

**Research gaps**:
- Limited philosophical engagement with housing crises in affluent democracies
- Under-theorized connections between housing and other justice issues (race, gender, class)

**Relevant BibTeX files**:
- literature-domain-3-housing-justice.bib
- literature-domain-2-homelessness-ethics.bib (Waldron on property)

**Target word count**: 700 words

## Section 5: Feminist Philosophical Perspectives (550-650 words)

**Purpose**: Examine gendered dimensions of home from analytical feminist philosophy

**Key debates**:
1. Home as site of oppression vs. site of dignity and resistance
2. Public/private dichotomy and feminist critique
3. Gendered division of domestic labor
4. Family, justice, and the home

**Structure**:
- Young (1997): canonical work on ambivalence of home values
  - Historical confinement of women vs. positive valence of home
  - Home can provide leverage for radical social critique
  - Home as site of dignity and resistance for oppressed groups
- Public/private dichotomy: Pateman's foundational critique
- Family and justice: Chambers, Muñoz-Dardé on family as source of inequality
- Integration: how does gender shape experience and meaning of home?

**Critical tensions**:
- Rejection vs. reclamation of home as feminist value
- Home as constraint vs. home as freedom
- Private sphere as exclusion from politics vs. private sphere as necessary protection

**Research gaps**:
- Limited recent analytical feminist work specifically on "home" (as opposed to family/domestic sphere)
- Need for intersectional analysis (race, class, gender)

**Relevant BibTeX files**:
- literature-domain-4-feminist-perspectives.bib
- literature-domain-1-analytical-foundations.bib (privacy, domestic)

**Target word count**: 600 words

## Section 6: Displacement, Migration, and the Ethics of Exile (600-700 words)

**Purpose**: Examine what is lost in displacement; ethics of migration and home

**Key debates**:
1. What is lost when one loses home? Place attachment vs. relocability
2. Rights to remain vs. rights to move
3. Refugee ethics and minimum conditions of dignity
4. Gentrification displacement: autonomy-based vs. communitarian critiques

**Structure**:
- Place attachment and identity (Malpas, place philosophy literature)
- Migration ethics: Carens on right to stay, social membership over time
- Refugee ethics: Parekh on evaporation of refuge; Vasanthakumar on exile politics

**Key debates**:
1. Ethics of exclusionary zoning and NIMBY-ism
2. Urban commons and right to the city
3. Legitimate expectations vs. housing access

## Section 8: Conclusion - Future Directions (350-400 words)

**Purpose**: Synthesize key insights; identify major research gaps; point toward encyclopedia expansion

**Key synthesis points**:
1. Home is complex concept requiring multi-dimensional analysis (legal, social, political, ethical)
2. Philosophical work increasingly empirically informed and policy-relevant (positive trend)
3. Analytical philosophy well-suited to clarify concepts, identify tensions, evaluate arguments
4. Integration needed: across scales (individual home to housing systems), across frameworks (capabilities, property, care ethics)

**Major research gaps identified**:
1. Under-theorized intersections: race, gender, class, and housing
2. Limited engagement with housing crises in affluent democracies
3. Need for philosophical work on specific policy tools
4. Integration of migration ethics and urban displacement ethics
5. Empirically-informed philosophical analysis (more engagement with housing studies)

## Urban Justice, NIMBY-ism, and Housing Policy Ethics

Philosophical analysis of home confronts practical urgency in debates over urban policy, exclusionary zoning, and community resistance to new housing. How should we evaluate NIMBY-ism ("Not In My Back Yard") resistance to housing development? When does neighborhood preservation justify exclusion? What obligations do communities have to accommodate newcomers? These applied ethics questions reveal deep tensions between property rights, legitimate expectations, distributive justice, and democratic participation.

Kohn (2016) offers the most philosophically developed account of urban justice through her concept of the "urban commonwealth." Drawing on solidarism—a largely forgotten strand of left-republican political theory from late 19th century France—Kohn argues that cities are concentrations of value created by past and present generations: infrastructure, public spaces, cultural institutions, community networks. These constitute a common wealth to which urban residents have claims not as property owners but as co-creators and co-inhabitants. When people lose access to urban commons through gentrification, slum clearance, or privatization, they are dispossessed of something to which they have rightful claims—what Lefebvre called "the right to the city."

This framework provides resources for evaluating displacement as injustice. Gentrification wrongs long-term residents not merely by raising costs or disrupting plans, but by appropriating common value they helped create for the benefit of newcomers and investors. The streets, parks, cultural vitality, and community networks that make neighborhoods desirable were built through residents' investments of time, labor, and care. When market processes or policy changes transfer access to these commons from original contributors to wealthier newcomers, a form of dispossession occurs. Kohn's account thus grounds objections to gentrification in republican principles of non-domination and fair terms of cooperation, not merely in distributive concerns.

Yet solidarism's applicability to contemporary housing debates faces challenges. If long-term residents have claims to neighborhoods based on their contributions, what about NIMBY-ism that excludes potential new residents? Don't exclusionary zoning laws protect existing residents' claims to neighborhoods they helped build? Kohn would likely distinguish: claims to remain differ from claims to exclude. Existing residents possess legitimate interests in preserving their communities, but not unlimited authority to exclude others or prevent neighborhood change. The line-drawing remains difficult: how much change must communities accommodate? What forms of exclusion are impermissible?

Recent philosophical work frames NIMBY-ism through "legitimate expectations": homeowners made decisions based on reasonable assumptions about neighborhood character, school quality, and land use patterns. When new development disrupts those expectations, it seems to violate implicit commitments. But this justification faces objections: many "expectations" encode unjust exclusions—racial and class segregation were often explicit goals of mid-century zoning. Moreover, as Kahlenberg (2023) argues, exclusionary zoning functions as class discrimination and, given racial income disparities, produces de facto racial segregation. After the Supreme Court's 1917 Buchanan v. Warley decision prohibited explicitly racial zoning, communities shifted to economic exclusion (minimum lot sizes, single-family zoning) with similar segregating effects.

Whittemore (2017) documents how exclusionary zoning was introduced in the early 1900s explicitly to prevent racial and ethnic minorities from entering middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. The Fair Housing Act prohibits racial discrimination but not class-based discrimination, creating a legal loophole that exclusionary zoning exploits. Because racial minorities have lower average incomes, policies that exclude low-income residents disproportionately exclude racial minorities—making contemporary exclusionary zoning, in outcome if not intent, a continuation of historical racial discrimination. This analysis suggests that appeals to "legitimate expectations" about neighborhood composition are suspect when those expectations rest on discriminatory foundations.

Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) argue from economic analysis with normative implications: restrictive zoning creates artificial scarcity, raises housing costs, and harms low-income people while benefiting existing homeowners. Their libertarian-progressive synthesis advocates deregulation to enable market-driven housing supply expansion. But this approach faces distributive justice concerns: will market processes produce affordable housing, or merely luxury development that accelerates displacement? The debate reflects a deeper tension between supply-side approaches emphasizing housing production and justice-based approaches emphasizing fair distribution and community control.

A critical research gap persists: philosophical analysis of specific policy tools remains sparse. We have abstract principles about housing justice but limited normative analysis of rent control, inclusionary zoning, public housing, community land trusts, or property tax structures. Which tools best realize housing justice while respecting legitimate interests in community stability, property rights, and democratic participation? This requires philosophical engagement with empirical housing policy research—a bridge that few philosophers have attempted to build.

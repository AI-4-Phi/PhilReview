  note      = {Argues that although states have right to control their borders, right to deport those who violate immigration laws is not absolute—with time, immigrants develop moral claim to stay. Core argument: moral right of states to apprehend and deport irregular migrants erodes with passage of time, as irregular migrants become more settled and their membership in society grows in moral importance. Many believe that over time irregular migrant can gradually acquire moral right to stay (and perhaps even to full citizenship), despite having had no right to migrate without authorization initially. Calls for rolling amnesty giving unauthorized migrants path to regularize status once settled for significant period. Moral argument builds on idea that persons' geographical presence in territory has normative significance captured by term social membership.}

  note      = {Rather than focus on what exiles mean for countries they enter, book recognizes their political and moral agency and explores their rich and vital relationship to communities they have left. Identifies responsibilities and rights exiles have. Argues exile politics can correct defective political institutions back home and counter asymmetries of voice and power abroad. Argues exiles have rights and responsibilities in their homelands and are morally required and permitted to play particular roles in homeland. Exile politics can perform two corrective functions: repair defective political institutions at home and compensate for institutional shortcomings in global domain. Counters overwhelming focus on consequences of forced migration for receiving societies—focus that often treats exiles as passive actors.

Limitarianism is not argument for equality of outcome, but for confronting upper tail of distribution of housing wealth. Housing limitarianism asserts it is wrong to possess excess housing. Applies under conditions: existence of material housing deprivation, and use of residential real estate as profit generating commodity that undermines fair and effective fulfillment of housing needs. Urgent needs argument: having too much housing might be impermissible in society where others do not have enough (e.g., holiday homes alongside homelessness).}

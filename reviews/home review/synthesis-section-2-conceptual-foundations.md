## Conceptual Foundations: What is "Home"?

The seemingly simple question "what is a home?" reveals deep conceptual complexity. Philosophical analysis must distinguish home from related concepts—house, dwelling, shelter, housing—each carrying different normative and descriptive weight. Recent analytical work identifies a fundamental tension between legal/property-based conceptions and social/relational conceptions of home, with significant implications for understanding homelessness and housing justice.

Jenkins and Brownlee (2022) propose a "ladder of home-related concepts" ascending from temporary shelter, to persistent shelter and housing, to a rich notion of home. This framework enables crucial distinctions: one can be sheltered but unhoused (as in emergency accommodation), or housed but unhomed (lacking the social bonds and meaningful control that constitute home). The "shelterless/sheltered" distinction concerns basic physical protection; "unhoused/housed" concerns stable, persistent accommodation; "unhomed/homed" concerns meeting social needs including belonging, identity-formation, and meaningful control over one's social environment (Jenkins and Brownlee 2022, 445-447). This conceptual ladder challenges reductionist accounts that conflate home with mere physical structure.

Essert (2016, 2022) defends a competing "legal conception": to have a home is to possess property rights that give one a place where one may be as of right, free from domination by or dependence on others. Homelessness, on this view, is constituted not primarily by lack of goods or even physical shelter, but by lack of property rights—specifically, the legal authority to control access to and use of space. To be homeless is "to be under the power of others—to be dominated by them or dependent on them—in respect of where one may be" (Essert 2016, 267). Property rights uniquely solve this problem by establishing zones of non-interference. The strength of this view is its connection to republican political theory and its explanation of why homelessness persists even when shelter is available: shelters and temporary accommodation fail to provide the legal security constitutive of home.

Jenkins and Brownlee object that the legal conception is too narrow, ignoring home's social functions. Many housed persons—consider victims of domestic violence or those in restrictive institutional settings—possess property rights but lack what makes a dwelling truly a home: social bonds, opportunities for intimacy, meaningful control over one's social environment. Conversely, some without formal property rights (unauthorized occupants, squatters in stable communities) may create genuine homes through social processes. The legal conception captures necessary conditions for resisting domination but misses what makes home valuable beyond non-interference.

Both conceptions illuminate different aspects of home. The legal conception highlights home's function in securing non-domination and independence—what we might call home's protective function. The social conception foregrounds home's constitutive role in identity, belonging, and meaningful relationships—home's generative function. Neither alone suffices. A complete philosophical account must integrate both dimensions: home requires both legal security (property rights or their functional equivalent) and social conditions (relationships, meaningful control, belonging). This integration points toward an under-theorized middle ground: what property rights enable is not merely non-interference but the social conditions for building a life.

The conceptual stakes are high. How we define "home" shapes our understanding of what homelessness deprives people of, what housing justice requires, and what displacement destroys. If home is merely property, housing policy should focus on legal title; if home is primarily social, policy must attend to community formation, relationship maintenance, and participatory control. The most promising direction integrates both: recognizing that legal security enables but does not guarantee the social conditions of home.

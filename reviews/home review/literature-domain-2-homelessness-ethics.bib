Explores how property rules (public and private) constrain freedom of homeless persons to perform basic life functions. Central claim: everything must be done somewhere, and no one is free to perform action unless there is somewhere they are free to perform it. Prohibitions on sleeping in public spaces are comprehensive in effect for homeless persons since property rules exclude them from private spaces. Foundational text in philosophical literature on homelessness.}

To be homeless is to be under power of others—to be dominated or dependent on them—in respect of where one may be. Counters distributive justice approaches, arguing property rights can uniquely provide solution to homelessness. Defends legal conception of homelessness as lack of property rights. Important reply by Jenkins \& Brownlee (2022) argues this conception is too narrow.}

Develops ladder of home-related concepts: temporary shelter, persistent shelter and housing, and rich notion of home focusing on meeting social needs including belonging and meaningful control over social environment. Enables distinguishing shelterless from sheltered; unhoused from housed; and unhomed from homed. Social conception vs. Essert's legal conception. Open access.}

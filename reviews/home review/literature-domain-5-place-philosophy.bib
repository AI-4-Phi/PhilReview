  note      = {Advances account of nature and significance of place as complex but unitary structure that encompasses self and other, space and time, subjectivity and objectivity. Argues significance of place is not to be found in our experience of place so much as in grounding of experience in place. Three main strands: first, that human being is inextricably bound to place; second, that place encompasses subjectivity and objectivity, being reducible to neither but foundational to both; third that place, which is distinct from, but also related to space and time, is methodologically and ontologically fundamental. Distinguished Professor at University of Tasmania. Work bridges analytic and continental traditions, creating unique philosophical discourse around human situatedness. Second edition published by Routledge 2018.}

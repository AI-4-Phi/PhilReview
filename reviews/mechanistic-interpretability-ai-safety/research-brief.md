# Research Brief: Mechanistic Interpretability and AI Safety

## Research Question
Is Mechanistic Interpretability necessary or sufficient for AI Safety?

## Context
This review supports a research paper in analytical philosophy, ethics, and philosophy of science aimed at clearing up confusion in the existing literature regarding:
1. The meaning of "mechanistic interpretability" (MI)
2. The role of MI for AI Safety

## Key Confusion to Address

Two papers present apparently conflicting views:

1. **Hendrycks, Dan, and Laura Hiscott.** "The Misguided Quest for Mechanistic AI Interpretability." AI Frontiers, May 15, 2025. https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/the-misguided-quest-for-mechanistic-ai-interpretability.
   - Defines MI as activations of individual nodes or clusters of nodes in neural networks

2. **Kästner, Lena, and Barnaby Crook.** "Explaining AI through Mechanistic Interpretability." European Journal for Philosophy of Science 14, no. 4 (2024): 52. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-024-00614-4.
   - Includes functional and higher-level explanations as part of MI (contradicting Hendrycks & Hiscott)
   - Claims MI is necessary for AI safety (in abstract)
   - Claims MI is sufficient for AI safety (stating "MI enables us to meet desirable social desiderata including safety")

## Review Objectives
1. Clarify the definition(s) of "mechanistic interpretability" in current literature
2. Assess how mechanistic interpretability relates to AI Safety (necessary? sufficient? neither? both?)

## Scope
- Topic areas: Explainable AI (XAI), AI Interpretability, and AI Safety
- Disciplinary focus: Interdisciplinary philosophy + arXiv preprints
- Time frame: Focus on papers published between 2023 and today (2025)
- Target audience: Analytic philosophers and journal editors in philosophy of science

## Expected Deliverables
- Domain-specific BibTeX files with comprehensive literature
- Structured outline emphasizing key debates about MI definitions and claims
- Complete literature review (3000-4000 words) addressing both objectives

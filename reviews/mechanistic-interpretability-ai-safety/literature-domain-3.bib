DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The XAI literature provides broader context for MI by mapping the diverse landscape of interpretability approaches. This includes post-hoc explanation methods (SHAP, LIME, attention visualization), inherently interpretable models (decision trees, linear models, rule-based systems), model-agnostic techniques, and human-centered evaluation of explanations.

Key debates include: faithfulness vs. plausibility of explanations, local vs. global interpretability, the trade-off between model performance and interpretability, and whether explanations should target model developers, end users, or regulators. Recent work questions whether popular explanation methods actually improve human understanding or trust.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain contextualizes MI within the broader interpretability landscape. It reveals that MI represents one specific paradigm among many approaches to making AI systems understandable. Understanding alternative paradigms is crucial for assessing MI's necessity claims.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited comparative work explicitly contrasting MI with other interpretability paradigms. Most papers focus on their own approach without systematic comparison. The relationship between different notions of "explanation" (causal, mechanistic, functional, teleological) remains unclear.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Use this domain to position MI as one paradigm among many. Highlight what makes MI distinctive (focus on mechanisms, circuits, internals) versus alternatives (behavioral, functional, input-output). Note trade-offs and complementarities.

KEY_POSITIONS:
[Will be determined from selected papers]

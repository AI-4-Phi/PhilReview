DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Philosophical work on mechanistic explanation, originating in philosophy of biology and neuroscience, provides conceptual foundations for understanding what makes an explanation "mechanistic." Key frameworks include Craver's mutual manipulability account, Bechtel's decomposition and localization, and Glennan's mechanisms as organized systems. Recent work applies these frameworks to AI/ML contexts.

Central questions include: What are the components and organization of mechanisms? What distinguishes mechanistic from other forms of explanation? What are the epistemic virtues of mechanistic explanations? How do idealization and abstraction relate to mechanistic understanding? The Kästner & Crook (2024) paper is a key bridge, applying mechanistic explanation frameworks to AI interpretability.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides philosophical grounding for the concept of "mechanistic" explanation. It's essential for understanding definitional disputes: what should count as mechanistic interpretability? The philosophy literature reveals that "mechanistic explanation" has specific philosophical commitments that may or may not apply to neural networks.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical work specifically addressing whether neural networks constitute mechanisms in the philosophical sense. Most applications assume they do without argument. Questions about whether learned weights/activations constitute mechanism parts remain underexplored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Use this domain to clarify what "mechanistic" means philosophically. Contrast philosophical accounts with how ML researchers use the term. Identify conceptual commitments: decomposition, localization, causal organization. Note tensions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
[Will be determined from selected papers]

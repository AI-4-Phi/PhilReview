## Completed Tasks

2025-12-22: Phase 1 complete - Created lit-review-plan.md with 5 domains
  - Domain 1: MI Foundations and Methods
  - Domain 2: AI Safety Theoretical Foundations
  - Domain 3: XAI and Interpretability Paradigms
  - Domain 4: Philosophy of Mechanistic Explanation
  - Domain 5: Interpretability for Safety Applications

## Current Task

Phase 2: Launching parallel literature searches across 5 domains

## Next Steps

1. Execute Domain 1 search (MI Foundations)
2. Execute Domain 2 search (AI Safety Theory)
3. Execute Domain 3 search (XAI Paradigms)
4. Execute Domain 4 search (Philosophy of Mechanisms)
5. Execute Domain 5 search (Interpretability-Safety Connections)
6. Verify coverage and quality
7. Proceed to Phase 3 (Synthesis Planning)

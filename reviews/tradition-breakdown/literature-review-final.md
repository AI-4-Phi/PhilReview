## Introduction

Political and cultural traditions are not merely inherited customs awaiting passive reception; they are dynamic frameworks that structure rationality, ground authority, and enable social coordination. When traditions break down, more is lost than particular practices or beliefs. As MacIntyre (1981) argues, traditions constitute the very contexts within which virtues can be understood and pursued; without them, moral discourse fragments into the incommensurable positions characteristic of modern emotivism. Gadamer (1960) goes further, positioning tradition not as an object to be grasped by detached reason but as the medium within which understanding itself occurs. Our prejudices—the pre-judgments shaped by tradition—are not obstacles to knowledge but its enabling conditions. When traditions collapse, we lose not just their content but the interpretive horizons that make meaning possible.

The question of how and why traditions break down has received surprisingly fragmented treatment in political philosophy. Philosophical accounts of tradition focus predominantly on its positive functions: MacIntyre (1988) develops tradition-constituted rationality and the concept of epistemological crisis; Gadamer (1960) rehabilitates prejudice and authority as sources of understanding; Oakeshott (1962) defends practical knowledge against rationalist encroachment. Yet these accounts theorize tradition maintenance more than tradition failure. Sociological treatments of modernization describe external pressures—rationalization, disenchantment, individualism—without systematically engaging the philosophical frameworks that explain what traditions are and why their loss matters. Historical case studies document specific collapses without providing generalizable mechanisms. What is lacking is systematic integration of these perspectives into a unified account of tradition failure.

This fragmentation is puzzling given what is at stake. Arendt (1961) identifies a mutually constitutive relationship between tradition and authority: traditions require authority for transmission, while authority depends on tradition for legitimacy. The rupture of this nexus in modernity produced not merely the loss of particular traditions but a permanent "crisis of authority" that no rational reconstruction can repair. If Arendt is right, understanding tradition breakdown is essential for grasping the distinctively modern political predicament. Hobsbawm (2012) adds a further complication: when organic traditions break down, invented traditions proliferate—recent constructions claiming ancient origins that serve social cohesion or institutional legitimation but lack the accumulated practical wisdom and adaptive flexibility of genuine traditions. Understanding why organic traditions fail is thus inseparable from understanding why their manufactured replacements prove inadequate.

This review synthesizes philosophical theories of tradition with accounts of internal breakdown mechanisms, external pressures, authority erosion, and the dynamics of invented traditions to identify patterns in tradition failure. The review proceeds from conceptual foundations—what traditions are and what makes them structurally vulnerable—through mechanisms of breakdown, both internal (epistemological crisis, ossification, practice corruption) and external (rationalist reform, modernization, colonial destruction). It concludes by critically assessing existing frameworks and identifying gaps that warrant further research. Throughout, the analysis emphasizes that traditions are fragile achievements requiring continuous active appropriation, not inert inheritances passively received. Their breakdown is not mere change but the dissolution of conditions that make certain forms of meaning, authority, and social coordination possible.


## Section 1: The Nature of Traditions and Structural Vulnerabilities

Understanding how traditions break down requires first grasping what traditions are and what structural features make them vulnerable to failure. The major philosophical accounts of tradition that emerged in the twentieth century converge on one crucial point: traditions are not static inheritances passively received but dynamic processes requiring active appropriation through practices, narratives, and authoritative transmission. This dynamism, however, is precisely what makes traditions fragile. Each major theoretical framework identifies distinct structural vulnerabilities—points at which the active work of tradition maintenance can fail, precipitating breakdown.

### 1.1 Practice-Based and Hermeneutic Accounts

The most influential contemporary account of tradition emerges from Alasdair MacIntyre's practice-based framework. In *After Virtue*, MacIntyre (1981) argues that traditions are best understood as "arguments extended through time," embedded in social practices that possess internal goods, standards of excellence, and narrative continuity. A practice—whether medicine, farming, or political deliberation—carries within it accumulated wisdom about how to pursue goods internal to that activity. Traditions are the historical extensions of such practices, sustaining and developing the standards by which excellence is judged. This framework reveals a fundamental vulnerability: traditions depend not merely on the transmission of content but on the active engagement of practitioners who must master inherited standards while extending inquiry into new problems. When practices corrupt—when external goods like money or status displace internal goods, when standards of excellence erode, or when communities fail to sustain conditions enabling practice-participation—traditions lose their rational foundation.

MacIntyre's (1988) concept of "epistemological crisis" provides the most developed philosophical account of tradition failure. Such crises occur when a tradition's conceptual resources prove inadequate to make intelligible what practitioners encounter—when problems arise that existing frameworks cannot solve. Healthy traditions respond to epistemological crises through narrative reconstruction that explains both the inadequate conceptual scheme and why it failed. But traditions can also collapse when they prove incapable of such reconstruction, when internal resources cannot generate adequate responses to the challenges they face. As D'Andrea (2006) explicates, this framework shows how traditions can be both historically particular and rationally progressive through internal critique—but also how they can fail by their own standards when that internal critique becomes impossible.

Lutz (2014) draws out the implications: traditions are fundamentally fragile, not robust. Their survival requires continuous re-appropriation by practitioners who actively inquire rather than passively receive. This fragility operates at multiple levels: traditions require practice-integrity (internal goods must remain central), virtue-cultivation (practitioners must develop excellences), and institutional support (social structures must enable participation). The failure of any element can precipitate breakdown.

Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic account offers a complementary perspective. In *Truth and Method*, Gadamer (1960) rehabilitates tradition as the enabling medium of understanding rather than an obstacle to truth. Understanding always occurs through "prejudices" (Vorurteile)—pre-judgments shaped by effective history that constitute our interpretive horizons. Against the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice," Gadamer argues that tradition-shaped pre-understandings make interpretation possible rather than distorting it. Traditions are not objects to be grasped by detached reason but the medium within which understanding occurs.

This hermeneutic framework identifies a different vulnerability. Traditions function when prejudices remain open to dialogical revision—when the "fusion of horizons" enables transformation through encounter with other perspectives. Breakdown occurs when prejudices ossify into dogmas resistant to dialogue, when traditions become closed systems unable to engage productively with challenges. Alexander (2016) captures the tension between these accounts: MacIntyre emphasizes rational inquiry within traditions while Gadamer emphasizes interpretation and dialogue. But both agree that traditions require active engagement rather than passive inheritance. The static tradition is already dying.

### 1.2 Authority, Legitimacy, and Institutional Carriers

If practice-based and hermeneutic accounts explain what traditions are, the question remains: through what mechanisms are they sustained and transmitted? Here the concepts of authority and institutional carriers become essential.

Hannah Arendt's (1961) foundational analysis identifies authority as distinct from both power (the capacity to act in concert) and violence (coercion through force). Authority, she argues, was historically rooted in the Roman trinity of tradition, religion, and authority—a configuration in which the founding of Rome sanctified political arrangements that were then transmitted through generations as authoritative inheritance. The modern age severed this trinity, producing a permanent "crisis of authority." What is lost is not merely specific forms of authority but the very concept itself: the binding force that made traditions authoritative rather than merely customary. Crucially, Arendt argues that authority cannot be restored once its foundations collapse—it cannot be manufactured through rational reconstruction or enforced through violence.

This analysis reveals a mutual dependence between tradition and authority that explains why their breakdown is mutually reinforcing. Traditions require authority for transmission: without authoritative teachers, institutions, and exemplars, traditions cannot be passed to new generations as binding rather than merely optional. But authority equally depends on tradition for its legitimacy: authority derives its binding force from connection to a sanctified past, not from present rational justification or coercive capacity. When either element weakens, the other necessarily suffers. The erosion of authority makes traditions appear as mere customs to be discarded; the breakdown of traditions leaves would-be authorities without grounds for their claims.

Edward Shils (1981) provides the sociological grounding for these philosophical claims. Traditions require institutional carriers—churches, universities, guilds, families—that structure intergenerational transmission. They require authority structures that designate who may authoritatively interpret and transmit traditional content. And they require mechanisms of apprenticeship through which tacit knowledge passes from practitioners to novices. Shils emphasizes that all societies require traditions to function; even revolutionary movements create new traditions while claiming to break with the past. But this necessity does not guarantee success. Transmission mechanisms can fail, institutions can decay, and authority structures can dissolve.

Michael Polanyi's (1958) epistemology illuminates a particular vulnerability in transmission. Much traditional knowledge is tacit—skills, judgments, and understandings that cannot be fully articulated or codified in explicit rules. Such knowledge is learned through apprenticeship relations, through dwelling with masters who embody competencies they cannot fully explain. When apprenticeship relations dissolve—when explicit codification is mistaken for genuine transmission, when communities of practice fragment—tacit knowledge is irretrievably lost. This is not mere forgetting; it is the destruction of knowledge that existed only in embodied practice.

Empirical research documents how these theoretical vulnerabilities manifest concretely. Dalton (2005) demonstrates that declining political trust is spreading across advanced industrial democracies, with the greatest declines occurring among educated elites—precisely those who might authoritatively transmit traditions. This pattern suggests the crisis is not merely one of institutional performance failure but of the grounds for authority itself. Seligson (2002) shows how corruption erodes institutional legitimacy, destroying not just trust in particular institutions but the interpersonal trust networks on which tradition transmission depends. Greene (2017) clarifies the distinctive character of traditional authority in Weber's typology: it operates through belief in "the sanctity of age-old rules and powers," a form of legitimacy that modernization's rationalization systematically undermines.

The structural vulnerabilities identified across these accounts can now be synthesized. Traditions fail through: (a) epistemological crisis—when conceptual resources prove inadequate to resolve problems; (b) ossification—when interpretive frameworks close off dialogical revision; (c) practice corruption—when external goods displace internal goods and standards erode; (d) authority erosion—when the binding force connecting tradition to sanctified founding dissolves; and (e) transmission failure—when institutional carriers decay and apprenticeship relations collapse. These vulnerabilities operate independently but often compound: external pressures precipitate internal crises, while internal weakness invites external disruption. Understanding tradition breakdown requires attending to all these dimensions and their interactions.


## Mechanisms of Tradition Breakdown

Traditions fail through distinct but interacting pathways. Some mechanisms are endogenous, arising from tensions within traditions themselves; others are exogenous, imposed by external forces that disrupt traditional practices or delegitimate traditional authority. Understanding how these mechanisms operate—and how they interact—is essential for diagnosing when traditions are undergoing productive transformation versus terminal decline.

### Internal Mechanisms: Epistemological Crisis, Ossification, and Practice Corruption

The most theoretically developed account of internal tradition failure comes from MacIntyre's concept of epistemological crisis. A tradition enters such a crisis when its conceptual resources cannot make intelligible what practitioners encounter—when anomalies accumulate that the tradition's established methods cannot explain (MacIntyre 1977). Resolution requires creating a new narrative that explains both the old inadequate scheme and why it failed, thereby making the crisis itself intelligible. Traditions that successfully navigate such crises emerge strengthened; those that cannot either fragment into competing schools or ossify into unreflective dogma.

MacIntyre's analysis in Three Rival Versions (1990) demonstrates how traditions can collapse through internal incoherence. The Enlightenment encyclopedist project—claiming to provide neutral, systematic knowledge transcending particular traditions—failed precisely because it could not acknowledge its own tradition-dependence. This internal contradiction proved fatal: a tradition that denies being a tradition cannot coherently justify its own standards. Herdt (1998) presses this point further, arguing that MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality itself faces a self-reference problem: if all rationality is tradition-bound, then the criteria for judging one tradition superior to another must themselves be tradition-relative, potentially undermining any claim to rational superiority.

Beyond epistemological crisis lies ossification—the hardening of living traditions into dead conventions. Angier (2014) argues that living traditions are characterized by ongoing internal debate about their own standards and purposes; when such argument ceases and conformity is enforced, traditions lose their adaptive capacity. This distinction between vitality and stagnation provides criteria for diagnosis: traditions degenerate not when they change but when they become too rigid to permit the internal contestation that enables adaptation.

The epistemological crisis framework has been applied to contemporary cases with mixed results. Petersen (2020) argues that Marxian economics has been defeated as a tradition of inquiry, unable to account for its systematic predictive failures or to resolve internal contradictions between theoretical commitments and empirical evidence. More dramatically, Lukic (2023) applies MacIntyre's framework to the Yugoslav narrative, showing how citizens lost the ability to make their own actions intelligible when moving between pre-Yugoslav, Yugoslav, and post-Yugoslav contexts. When a political tradition's narrative framework collapses, it ceases providing the conceptual resources people need to understand their roles and purposes—producing mass existential disorientation.

### External Pressures: Rationalism, Modernization, and Colonial Destruction

While internal mechanisms reveal how traditions defeat themselves, external pressures show how traditions can be destroyed from without. Oakeshott's (1962) critique of "rationalism in politics" identifies a primary mechanism: the attempt to replace practical knowledge—embedded in traditions and learned through participation—with explicit technical rules derived from abstract theory. Rationalists mistake ideological abstraction for genuine understanding, destroying irreplaceable practical wisdom in the name of reform.

Scott (2017) extends this analysis to state-driven modernization projects, showing how "high modernism"—the belief that scientific-technical knowledge can reshape society for the better—produces disasters when combined with authoritarian power. Soviet collectivization, Tanzanian villagization, and scientific forestry all imposed simplified, legible schemas that overrode local practical knowledge (what Scott calls "metis"). The result was not merely inefficiency but the destruction of traditional practices that had sustained communities for generations. Scott identifies four conditions for such disasters: administrative ordering of society, high-modernist ideology, authoritarian state power, and a civil society too weak to resist.

Secularization and disenchantment represent subtler but equally pervasive external pressures. Taylor's A Secular Age (2007) traces how modernization transforms the "conditions of belief" from a world where tradition was taken for granted to one where both belief and unbelief become contested options within an "immanent frame." Crucially, Taylor's earlier Sources of the Self (1990) shows how the internalization of moral sources—relocating them from external traditional frameworks to within the individual—transforms tradition from constitutive framework to external constraint. When moral authority shifts inward, traditions lose their taken-for-granted status and must justify themselves before the tribunal of individual conscience.

Colonial destruction represents the most violent form of external pressure. Whyte (2019) demonstrates that colonialism operates not merely through ideological delegitimation but through physical containment—preventing the exercise of traditional practices. Indigenous mobility traditions, based on fluid relationships with environment and seasonal migration, were destroyed by colonial policies that fixed populations in place. Even when traditional knowledge was retained, colonial containment made its practice impossible, severing the link between knowing and doing that traditions require. Conrad (2012) challenges Eurocentric frameworks by showing how Enlightenment narratives of rationalization and disenchantment themselves functioned as instruments of tradition destruction, declaring non-Western practices "backward" or "irrational" to legitimate colonial intervention.

### Invented Traditions and Authenticity

Hobsbawm's (2012) influential framework distinguishes "invented traditions"—recent constructions claiming ancient origins—from organic traditions that evolved through genuine historical continuity. Invented traditions proliferate precisely when older traditions break down, serving to establish social cohesion, legitimize institutions, or inculcate values through repetition that claims continuity with the past. Crucially, invented traditions are typically more rigid than organic ones: because they lack embedded social practices and genuine historical roots, they cannot adapt flexibly to changing circumstances.

Ranger's (2012) analysis of colonial Africa reveals how invented traditions can be weaponized for social control. Colonial administrators created "customary law" systems and tribal identities that froze African societies in an imagined traditional past while reserving modernity for Europeans. These invented traditions were more rigid and ahistorical than either European or genuine pre-colonial African practices, precisely because they served political rather than social functions. When traditions are fabricated for domination rather than emerging from lived practice, they shatter under pressure rather than evolving.

Yet the organic/invented distinction faces significant challenges. Alexander (2016) argues that all traditions involve both transmission from the past and active construction in the present, making sharp authenticity distinctions untenable. What matters is not whether a tradition is historically authentic but whether it successfully embeds itself in meaningful practices. Bogumil (2018) reinforces this point through analysis of the Russian Orthodox Church's canonization of Soviet-era "New Martyrs"—an obviously constructed tradition that has nonetheless proven remarkably resilient because it aligns with powerful institutional interests.

Abizadeh (2014) identifies a distinctive vulnerability of invented traditions in liberal democratic contexts: their dependence on myths that cannot withstand critical examination. Liberal democracies are committed to norms of publicity, free inquiry, and rational justification that will eventually expose fabricated origins. This creates structural instability: the very institutional commitments that characterize liberal democracy undermine the mythological foundations that nationalist traditions require. Vorontsov (2023) notes a deeper conceptual confusion: different theorists assign contradictory meanings to "tradition" (flexible versus rigid, rational versus pre-rational), making claims about tradition breakdown systematically ambiguous.

### Conservative and Communitarian Diagnoses

Conservative and communitarian thinkers offer distinctive diagnoses of how liberal modernity undermines tradition. MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981) traces moral fragmentation to the Enlightenment's abandonment of Aristotelian teleology: without a shared conception of human purposes, moral discourse becomes incoherent, producing emotivism—the reduction of moral claims to expressions of preference—and incommensurability between competing positions. Liberal individualism severs the connections between practices, narrative, and tradition that virtue requires.

Taylor's Ethics of Authenticity (1991) shows how a genuine tradition—Romantic authenticity—degenerates through internal corruption rather than external destruction. Authenticity, originally meaning truthfulness to horizons of significance beyond the self, devolved into shallow self-fulfillment disconnected from any larger framework of meaning. The vocabulary persists while the substance erodes: people invoke "authenticity" while practicing mere self-gratification. This demonstrates that traditions can decay while retaining their surface forms—a corruption more insidious than outright destruction.

Sandel (1982) diagnoses liberal neutrality itself as tradition-eroding. Procedural liberalism's conception of an "unencumbered self" prior to communal attachments conceptually severs the ties that make tradition possible. If selves are not constituted by their communities but merely choose associations, then traditions appear as external constraints on freedom rather than sources of identity. Liberal neutrality among conceptions of the good, far from protecting traditions, evacuates public discourse of the substantive moral content that traditions provide. Scruton (1980) emphasizes that traditions depend on pre-rational allegiances and embodied practices that abstract liberalism cannot recognize—let alone protect.

Yet these diagnoses face critical challenges. Bourke (2018) argues that "conservatism" as a unified tradition is itself a twentieth-century construction: Burke was a reformist Whig, not the founder of a conservative tradition. If conservative thinkers lack a shared tradition of their own, their diagnoses of tradition breakdown may be less unified than presented. This meta-level critique suggests that laments about tradition loss may themselves be part of an invented tradition serving contemporary political purposes.

The interaction between internal and external mechanisms is crucial. External pressures often precipitate internal crises: colonial destruction may trigger epistemological breakdown, while rationalist reform may expose internal contradictions that traditions had previously accommodated. Conversely, internal weakness invites external disruption: traditions already suffering practice corruption or authority erosion are more vulnerable to modernizing pressures. Understanding tradition breakdown requires attention to both pathways and their compounding effects.


## Research Gaps and Critical Assessment

Despite the substantial scholarly attention to how traditions function and why they matter, significant lacunae remain in our understanding of tradition breakdown. The literature reviewed above reveals five critical gaps that constrain theoretical development and practical application.

### Gap 1: Limited Integration Across Theoretical Frameworks

The most striking gap is the persistent fragmentation between philosophical accounts of tradition and empirical studies of political and cultural collapse. MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework, Gadamer's hermeneutic analysis, and Oakeshott's defense of practical knowledge offer sophisticated conceptual vocabularies, yet these rarely engage systematically with the historical sociology of revolutions (Skocpol 1979), democratic breakdown (Somer 2019), or institutional decay (Dalton 2005). Conversely, empirical case studies of regime collapse and cultural transformation seldom draw on philosophical tradition theory, treating "tradition" as background context rather than an analytically precise category.

Alexander (2016) begins to address this by comparing Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre's rival conceptualizations, revealing how each framework identifies different dimensions of breakdown: catastrophic rupture, gradual erosion through rationalism, and internal epistemological failure. Lukic (2023) applies MacIntyre's intelligibility crisis to Yugoslav narrative collapse, demonstrating how philosophical concepts can illuminate concrete political disintegration. Yet sustained cross-domain synthesis remains rare. Without integration, we lack a unified diagnostic vocabulary: philosophical frameworks identify structural vulnerabilities but float free of evidence; empirical studies accumulate cases but lack the theoretical architecture to identify common mechanisms. The research agenda requires systematic application of tradition-theoretic concepts to historical cases, testing whether frameworks developed for intellectual traditions illuminate political and cultural ones.

### Gap 2: Under-Theorized Distinction Between Adaptation and Destruction

All accounts acknowledge that traditions must change to survive. MacIntyre's epistemological crisis can lead to productive reconstruction or terminal collapse; Hobsbawm's invented traditions may successfully embed in practice or remain superficial impositions. Yet criteria for distinguishing healthy adaptation from destructive breakdown remain philosophically underdeveloped.

Angier (2014) offers the most promising direction, characterizing living traditions by ongoing internal debate about standards and purposes, while ossification occurs when argument ceases and conformity is enforced. This suggests that what matters is not whether traditions change but whether they retain the reflexive capacity for self-criticism. Obidina (2022) sharpens this by contrasting Hobsbawm's "invention" with Eisenstadt's "transformation": reconstruction differs from fabrication in maintaining continuity with lived practices and cultural memory. But these remain gestural rather than systematic.

The stakes are considerable. Without clear criteria, we cannot diagnose when political traditions are undergoing productive transformation versus terminal decline, nor can we evaluate when institutional reform operates within tradition versus when it destroys tradition itself. This matters practically: determining whether democratic norms are adapting to new circumstances or degenerating into something unrecognizable requires criteria that the current literature fails to provide.

### Gap 3: Non-Western Perspectives and Comparative Analysis

The dominant frameworks for understanding tradition and its breakdown—MacIntyre, Gadamer, Arendt, Oakeshott, Taylor—analyze Western traditions within Western modernity. Studies of colonial tradition destruction document what was lost (Ranger 2012; Whyte 2019) but rarely engage non-Western philosophical frameworks for understanding tradition itself.

This parochialism produces two problems. First, if tradition-breakdown frameworks are distinctively Western, they may misdiagnose dynamics in non-Western contexts or miss forms of tradition resilience and revival that Western categories cannot capture. Piccolo (2023) demonstrates this forcefully: even ostensibly "decolonizing" critical theory imposes categories alien to Indigenous thought, which understands normativity through nature and substantive visions of living well rather than purely historical location and negative critique. Indigenous mobility traditions, as Whyte (2019) documents, embody forms of adaptive knowledge that Western frameworks focusing on textual transmission cannot adequately conceptualize.

Second, the literature provides rich analysis of tradition breakdown but comparatively little on tradition survival and renewal under pressure. Ali (2022) offers a counterexample, analyzing Islamic revivalism not as anti-modern reaction but as creative response to secular modernity's crisis, seeking to steer modernity through Islamization rather than reject it entirely. Comparative analysis across civilizational contexts could reveal whether breakdown mechanisms identified in Western literature apply cross-culturally, or whether different tradition-structures exhibit distinctive pathologies and resiliences.

### Gap 4: Micro-Level Transmission Failure

Most literature operates at macro-level: civilizational transitions, philosophical tradition crises, regime collapse. The micro-level processes by which transmission actually fails—how specific practices lose practitioners, how institutions cease cultivating virtues, how apprenticeship relations dissolve—receive less systematic attention.

Shils (1981) identifies transmission mechanisms (authority structures, institutional carriers, educational systems) and Polanyi (1958) theorizes tacit knowledge transmitted through apprenticeship, but empirical research on their contemporary failure remains sparse. Jeon (2024) applies Arendt's authority crisis to education, showing how teachers lose the tradition-grounded authority necessary for cultural transmission when broader authority structures erode. Snir (2018) explores possibilities for "critical traditionalism" in education that might reconcile tradition's authority with modernity's critical demands.

This gap matters because macro-level breakdown consists of accumulated micro-level failures. Understanding why particular communities cease transmitting particular practices, or why specific institutions fail to cultivate the virtues their traditions require, is essential for both diagnosis and intervention. The current literature offers theoretical frameworks for understanding what traditions need to survive but limited empirical research on how these requirements fail in specific contemporary domains.

### Gap 5: Contemporary Democratic Tradition Erosion

A burgeoning literature documents democratic backsliding, polarization, and institutional erosion across established democracies. Bennett and Livingston (2018) identify disinformation as a pathway to legitimacy crisis; van Ham et al. (2017) question empirical evidence for uniform legitimacy decline; Somer (2019) traces Turkey's slide from reformist polarization to authoritarian breakdown. Yet this literature largely proceeds without engaging tradition-theoretic vocabulary.

The question is whether democratic norms and institutions constitute "traditions" in the philosophically relevant sense. If democratic constitutionalism embodies a form of practical knowledge transmitted through institutional practice, if it depends on authority structures that command deference without requiring continuous justification, if it provides the interpretive horizons through which citizens understand their political world—then the tools developed for understanding tradition breakdown should illuminate contemporary democratic crises.

Achilles (2025) offers suggestive evidence, reinterpreting Weimar not as failed democracy but as robust democratic culture whose collapse was contingent rather than inevitable. This separates regime failure from tradition failure: the Republic fell, but democratic traditions persisted to inform post-war reconstruction. Choudhry (2018) connects Weimar lessons to contemporary constitutional design, asking how institutions can resist backsliding when commitment to democratic norms erodes. Yet systematic application of epistemological crisis, authority erosion, and practice corruption frameworks to contemporary democratic challenges remains nascent.

### Synthesis: What Is Missing

The literature on tradition breakdown remains fragmented across philosophical, sociological, and historical disciplines. Philosophical frameworks provide conceptual vocabulary—epistemological crisis, authority-tradition nexus, practical knowledge, hermeneutic horizon—but lack empirical grounding in concrete cases of failure. Case studies provide rich evidence of how traditions have collapsed but lack the theoretical integration to identify common mechanisms and generalizable patterns.

Four unresolved questions emerge from this review. First, what distinguishes healthy adaptation from destructive change? The literature offers no systematic criteria for recognizing when a tradition is undergoing productive transformation versus terminal decline. Second, do Western frameworks apply cross-culturally, or do different tradition-structures exhibit distinctive pathologies? The reliance on Western cases limits generalizability. Third, how do micro-level transmission failures aggregate into macro-level collapse? The emphasis on civilizational and regime-level analysis obscures the concrete processes of practice erosion. Fourth, does contemporary democratic erosion constitute tradition breakdown in the philosophically relevant sense, and if so, which theoretical frameworks best illuminate its dynamics?

Addressing these gaps requires research that bridges disciplinary divides: systematic application of philosophical frameworks to historical and contemporary cases, empirical investigation of transmission failure in specific domains, engagement with non-Western tradition theory, and careful conceptual work distinguishing adaptation from destruction. Until such integration is achieved, our understanding of tradition breakdown will remain theoretically sophisticated but empirically thin, or empirically rich but theoretically fragmented.


## Conclusion

This review has examined how political and cultural traditions break down, revealing traditions not as static inheritances but as dynamic processes requiring active appropriation through practices, narratives, and authoritative transmission. The philosophical accounts of MacIntyre (1981, 1988), Gadamer (1960), and Oakeshott (1962) establish that traditions structure rationality itself and transmit knowledge that cannot be fully articulated. Yet this very dependence on continuous practice and interpretation renders traditions fragile: they can fail through epistemological crisis when conceptual resources prove inadequate (MacIntyre 1977), through ossification when argument ceases and conformity is enforced (Angier 2014), through practice corruption when internal goods are subordinated to external rewards (Lutz 2014), through rationalist assault that replaces practical wisdom with technical rules (Scott 2017), through colonial destruction that physically prevents traditional practices (Whyte 2019), and through secularization that transforms traditions from constitutive frameworks into contestable options (Taylor 2007).

The authority-tradition nexus emerges as central to understanding breakdown dynamics. Arendt (1961) demonstrates that tradition and authority are mutually dependent: traditions require authoritative institutions for transmission, while authority derives its legitimacy from connection to a sanctified founding transmitted through tradition. When this connection breaks, authority cannot be restored through rational reconstruction or force. The empirical evidence of declining institutional trust across democracies (Dalton 2005; Seligson 2002) and the contemporary spread of disinformation that undermines epistemic authority (Bennett and Livingston 2018) suggest this mutual collapse continues to accelerate.

Invented traditions exhibit distinctive vulnerabilities, particularly in liberal democratic contexts where commitments to rational justification and free inquiry will eventually expose their fabricated character (Abizadeh 2014). Yet the sharp distinction between organic and invented traditions proves less tenable than Hobsbawm (2012) suggested. As Alexander (2016) argues, all traditions involve selective construction and reconstruction; what matters is whether traditions successfully embed in meaningful practices and maintain adaptive capacity, not their historical authenticity. Conservative and communitarian diagnoses from MacIntyre, Taylor (1991), Sandel (1982), and Scruton (1980) offer rich phenomenological accounts of tradition loss in Western liberal modernity, but their applicability to non-Western contexts remains underexplored, and their frameworks may not adequately address traditions that are themselves oppressive.

The research question thus opens onto significant gaps requiring systematic attention: integrating philosophical tradition theory with empirical historical research, developing criteria distinguishing healthy adaptation from destructive breakdown, incorporating non-Western perspectives on tradition and its failure, and applying tradition-breakdown frameworks to contemporary democratic erosion. A unified account would connect the structural vulnerabilities identified by philosophers with the causal mechanisms documented by historians and sociologists, providing both diagnostic tools for recognizing tradition failure and normative criteria for evaluating when traditions warrant preservation versus when their breakdown enables needed transformation.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines concrete historical and empirical cases of tradition
breakdown across political and cultural contexts. The literature reveals
several critical patterns: (1) revolutionary moments as sites of tradition
rupture (French, Russian, Iranian revolutions); (2) democratic collapse and
institutional failure (Weimar Republic, contemporary Turkey); (3) totalitarian
destruction of tradition (Nazi Germany, Stalinism); and (4) structural
transformations that erode traditional frameworks (post-communist transitions).

Key scholarly contributions come from Hannah Arendt's analysis of revolution
and totalitarianism as tradition-destroying phenomena, Theda Skocpol's
comparative historical sociology of revolutions, and contemporary case studies
of democratic backsliding. The literature demonstrates that tradition breakdown
is rarely a simple linear process but involves complex interactions between
institutional weakness, social mobilization, ideological transformation, and
crisis conditions.

Recent scholarship (2015-2025) extends this analysis to contemporary cases of
democratic erosion, revealing how polarization, elite defection from democratic
norms, and the politicization of deep cultural divides can accelerate tradition
collapse. The empirical literature provides crucial evidence for testing
theoretical claims about mechanisms of tradition failure.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the empirical foundation for understanding how traditions
actually break down in practice. The case studies offer concrete evidence of
mechanisms, sequences, and contingencies involved in tradition failure that
theoretical frameworks must account for. Historical cases like Weimar, the
French Revolution, and contemporary democratic backsliding provide test cases
for evaluating theories of tradition breakdown and for identifying warning
signs of tradition failure.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature provides rich case studies of dramatic tradition collapse
(revolutions, democratic breakdown), there is less systematic analysis of
slower, incremental processes of tradition erosion. Few studies explicitly
connect case study evidence to general theories of tradition breakdown or
systematically compare successful tradition adaptation with tradition failure.
The connection between cultural/intellectual tradition breakdown and political/
institutional collapse deserves more systematic treatment.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should organize case studies by type of breakdown
(revolutionary, institutional collapse, totalitarian destruction, gradual
erosion) and identify common causal mechanisms across cases. Special attention
should be paid to Arendt's conceptual framework for understanding tradition
breakdown through revolution and totalitarianism, as this provides a bridge
between empirical cases and theoretical analysis. The contrast between Weimar
and post-WWII German democracy offers particularly valuable insights into
conditions for tradition resilience versus failure.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Structural explanations (Skocpol): 8 papers - Tradition breakdown driven by
  state crisis, class structure, and international pressures
- Political process approaches: 6 papers - Role of elite choices, polarization,
  and institutional design in tradition collapse
- Cultural/ideological approaches (Arendt): 4 papers - Tradition breakdown as
  rupture in meaning, loss of authority, and ideological transformation

@book{arendt1963revolution,
  author = {Arendt, Hannah},
  title = {On Revolution},
  year = {1963},
  publisher = {Viking Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt distinguishes between the American and French revolutions, arguing that the American Revolution succeeded in establishing a stable political order by focusing on constituting freedom through republican institutions, while the French Revolution failed by prioritizing the "social question" of poverty over political freedom. She contends that revolutions represent both a break with tradition and an attempt to found new political authority, with the French case demonstrating how this rupture can lead to terror and instability when grounded in necessity rather than freedom.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding revolution as a mechanism of tradition breakdown. Provides both a conceptual framework for analyzing how revolutionary moments destroy inherited political traditions and empirical analysis of two paradigmatic cases. Her distinction between successful and failed revolutionary founding offers crucial insights into conditions under which new political orders can establish their own traditions versus descending into chaos or tyranny. Central to understanding the relationship between tradition breakdown and political legitimacy.

  POSITION: Represents the political-phenomenological approach to revolution, emphasizing the role of action, founding, and the space of appearance rather than structural or economic factors.

@book{arendt1951origins,
  author = {Arendt, Hannah},
  title = {The Origins of Totalitarianism},
  year = {1951},
  publisher = {Harcourt, Brace and Company},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt analyzes how totalitarian movements (Nazism and Stalinism) represented a radical break with all Western political tradition. She argues that totalitarianism destroyed traditional distinctions between public and private, replaced factual reality with ideological fiction, and sought to eliminate human spontaneity itself through terror and total domination. The book traces how imperialism, anti-Semitism, and the breakdown of nation-states created conditions for this unprecedented form of rule.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding tradition breakdown through totalitarian destruction. Arendt explicitly argues that totalitarianism's novelty consisted in its complete rupture with tradition, making traditional political concepts inadequate for understanding it. Provides crucial case study evidence of how extreme ideological movements can systematically dismantle inherited institutions, norms, and ways of thinking. Essential for understanding the most radical form of tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Represents the view that totalitarianism is sui generis, unprecedented, and incomprehensible through traditional political categories—itself a claim about tradition's inability to survive certain historical ruptures.

@book{skocpol1979states,
  author = {Skocpol, Theda},
  title = {States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China},
  year = {1979},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511815805},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Skocpol develops a structural theory of social revolutions, arguing that revolutions result from the confluence of state breakdown (caused by international military competition and fiscal crisis), peasant rebellion, and elite conflict. Through comparative analysis of France (1789), Russia (1917), and China (1949), she demonstrates how similar structural conditions produce revolutionary transformations that fundamentally alter state structures and class relations. Revolutions are "made" not by revolutionaries but by structural contradictions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most influential comparative-historical analysis of revolution as tradition-breaking transformation. Essential for understanding how structural factors (state crisis, class conflict, international pressure) create conditions for rapid institutional collapse and regime change. Offers systematic evidence on patterns and mechanisms of tradition breakdown across different historical contexts, demonstrating both common structural causes and variable revolutionary outcomes.

  POSITION: Structural-functionalist approach that emphasizes objective conditions over agency, ideology, or cultural factors in explaining revolutionary tradition breakdown.

@article{fine2014evolution,
  author = {Fine, Robert},
  title = {The evolution of the modern revolutionary tradition: a phenomenological reading of Hannah Arendt's On revolution},
  journal = {European Journal of Cultural and Political Sociology},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {216--233},
  doi = {10.1080/23254823.2014.990244},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fine offers a phenomenological reading of Arendt's On Revolution, examining how she conceptualized the revolutionary tradition itself as something that evolved and ultimately broke down. He argues that Arendt saw the revolutionary tradition as containing within it both the promise of political freedom and the seeds of its own destruction through the elevation of the social question over politics.

  RELEVANCE: Provides sophisticated interpretation of Arendt's analysis of how traditions of revolution themselves can degenerate or fail. Illuminates the reflexive dimension of tradition breakdown—how the very tradition of revolutionary transformation can lose its emancipatory potential and become destructive. Important for understanding Arendt's broader claim that modernity involved the breakdown of the tradition of political thought itself.

  POSITION: Phenomenological-interpretive approach to understanding revolution as both practice and tradition, with emphasis on meaning and historical consciousness.

@article{somer2019turkey,
  author = {Somer, Murat},
  title = {Turkey: The Slippery Slope from Reformist to Revolutionary Polarization and Democratic Breakdown},
  journal = {The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {681},
  pages = {42--61},
  doi = {10.1177/0002716218818056},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Somer analyzes Turkey's democratic breakdown under Erdogan and the AKP, identifying ten causal mechanisms that transformed initially reformist polarization into "revolutionary" authoritarian transformation. He shows how what began as democratic opening morphed into systematic erosion of democratic institutions through an "authoritarian spiral" that politicized formative historical rifts, consolidated executive power, and marginalized opposition.

  RELEVANCE: Provides contemporary case study of democratic tradition breakdown that parallels historical cases like Weimar. Demonstrates how democratic institutions and norms can be dismantled from within by elected leaders through polarization, institutional manipulation, and the politicization of deep cultural cleavages. Essential for understanding mechanisms of gradual democratic erosion as distinct from sudden revolutionary rupture. Shows how tradition breakdown unfolds in real time.

  POSITION: Political process approach emphasizing agency, elite strategy, and polarization dynamics rather than purely structural factors.

  journal = {European Journal of Political Theory},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {10},
  number = {3},
  pages = {350--371},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885111406386},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Disch situates Arendt's divergent assessments of American and French revolutions within historiographical traditions, showing how Arendt's "fable" of American success relied on selective reading that ignored social conflict and emphasized constitutional founding. She argues Arendt's contrasting evaluations reveal tensions in her own political theory, particularly regarding the relationship between social and political questions.

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis of Arendt's most influential case studies of revolution and tradition breakdown. Important for evaluating the empirical adequacy of Arendt's framework and for understanding how her theoretical commitments shaped her historical interpretations. Raises important methodological questions about using historical cases to develop theories of tradition breakdown while remaining attentive to historical complexity.

  POSITION: Critical historiographical approach that challenges Arendt's binary framework while taking seriously her insights into revolutionary founding.

  journal = {Scientific Artsakh},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {2},
  number = {13},
  pages = {121--140},
  doi = {10.52063/25792652-2022.2.13-121},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mughnetsyan provides systematic analysis of institutional factors that led to Weimar's democratic collapse, emphasizing the absence of electoral thresholds, parliamentary fragmentation, semi-presidential system design flaws, and weak checks and balances. He argues these institutional weaknesses, combined with socioeconomic crisis, created structural conditions enabling authoritarian takeover rather than being merely incidental to it.

  RELEVANCE: Offers institutional-design perspective on tradition breakdown, showing how constitutional and electoral structures can either reinforce or undermine democratic traditions. The Weimar case provides crucial evidence for understanding how institutional weakness interacts with crisis conditions to produce regime collapse. Important for identifying specific institutional vulnerabilities that accelerate tradition breakdown versus features that enhance resilience.

  POSITION: Institutionalist approach emphasizing formal rules and structures over culture or agency in explaining democratic collapse.

@book{weisman2013hannah,
  author = {Weisman, Tama},
  title = {Hannah Arendt and Karl Marx: On Totalitarianism and the Tradition of Western Political Thought},
  year = {2013},
  publisher = {Lexington Books},
  address = {Lanham, MD},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Weisman examines Arendt's critique of Marx as exemplifying the breakdown of the Western political tradition. She argues Arendt saw Marx's elevation of labor, violence, and historical necessity as representing a fundamental rupture with classical political thought, making totalitarianism intellectually possible. The book analyzes how Arendt understood modern ideologies as products of tradition's collapse rather than its continuation.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates Arendt's broader thesis about the breakdown of political tradition in modernity, using Marx as paradigmatic case of how this breakdown occurred. Important for understanding the intellectual dimensions of tradition collapse—how shifts in fundamental concepts can prepare the ground for political catastrophe. Connects theoretical tradition breakdown to historical emergence of totalitarianism.

  POSITION: Intellectual-historical approach emphasizing the role of ideas and conceptual frameworks in political tradition breakdown.

  journal = {AgEcon Search},
  year = {2005},
  doi = {10.22004/ag.econ.26391},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zweynert and Goldschmidt analyze post-communist transitions as cases of double institutional transplantation—first Soviet institutions imposed on Central/Eastern European societies, then democratic-capitalist institutions after 1989. They argue that success of institutional transfer depends on compatibility with informal institutional settings and cultural traditions, explaining divergent performance across transition countries.

  RELEVANCE: Provides crucial evidence on the interaction between formal institutional change and informal traditional practices during rapid political transformation. Shows how attempts to impose new institutions can succeed or fail depending on their relationship to existing cultural traditions and social structures. Important for understanding conditions under which tradition breakdown leads to successful transformation versus chaos or authoritarianism.

  POSITION: New institutional economics approach emphasizing path dependence and institutional complementarity in explaining transition outcomes.

  number = {1},
  pages = {54--74},
  doi = {10.1017/S2045381718000011},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Choudhry uses the Weimar case to develop a theory of constitutional resistance to democratic backsliding. He argues that constitutions must be self-enforcing through mechanisms that do not depend solely on institutional actors' commitment to democratic norms. Drawing on Frankfurt School critical theory, he shows how cultural and ideological factors interact with institutional design to determine regime stability.

  RELEVANCE: Connects historical case of Weimar's collapse to contemporary concerns about democratic erosion, offering insights into how constitutional traditions can resist breakdown. Important for understanding the relationship between formal institutions, cultural norms, and political commitment in maintaining or undermining democratic traditions. Shows how lessons from tradition breakdown can inform institutional design to prevent future collapse.

  volume = {19},
  number = {3},
  pages = {347--367},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885116685391},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gaffney challenges Arendt's exclusion of the Haitian Revolution from her revolutionary tradition, arguing this omission reveals limitations in Arendt's framework that cannot account for anti-colonial revolutions or the revolutionary agency of enslaved peoples. She contends this gap reflects broader problems in how Western political thought conceptualizes revolutionary tradition and its breakdown.

  RELEVANCE: Critical examination of what gets included or excluded from narratives of revolutionary tradition and its breakdown. Important for recognizing how definitions of tradition and its collapse can themselves reflect particular political perspectives and exclusions. Raises questions about whose traditions count as breaking down and whether anti-colonial struggles represent tradition breakdown or tradition creation.

  POSITION: Postcolonial-critical approach challenging Eurocentric frameworks for understanding revolution and tradition.

  number = {2},
  pages = {192--207},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.12523},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Straehle analyzes Arendt's understanding of how revolutions reconfigure temporal relationships, arguing that revolutionary tradition breakdown involves not merely destruction of the past but transformation of how past, present, and future relate to each other. Revolutions attempt to start anew while necessarily drawing on past traditions, creating inherent tension in revolutionary founding.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conceptual analysis of the temporal structure of tradition breakdown and revolutionary rupture. Important for understanding tradition not as static inheritance but as dynamic relationship to past that revolutions disrupt. Illuminates the paradox that revolutionary attempts to break with tradition must themselves draw on traditional resources, creating instability in revolutionary foundings.

  doi = {10.1177/0090591792020004002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Isaac compares Arendt's and Camus's analyses of rebellion and revolution, arguing both developed accounts of "rebellious politics" that recognize the necessity of resistance while remaining skeptical of revolutionary utopianism. He shows how both thinkers understood modern political crises as resulting from tradition breakdown but differed on possibilities for political renewal.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates alternative responses to tradition breakdown beyond revolution or restoration. Important for understanding how political thinkers have grappled with the problem of political action in conditions where traditional sources of authority and meaning have collapsed. Provides conceptual resources for thinking about politics after tradition breakdown.

  pages = {450--477},
  doi = {10.1177/00905917211046107},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grosser reconstructs Arendt's attempt to distinguish between "political" and "anti-political" forms of revolution, arguing she sought historical and conceptual criteria for identifying revolutions that successfully establish freedom versus those that destroy it. He shows how Arendt's framework depends on contested assumptions about the relationship between social and political questions.

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis of Arendt's framework for evaluating different revolutionary outcomes and their relationship to tradition breakdown. Important for understanding normative criteria that might distinguish successful political transformation from destructive tradition collapse. Raises methodological questions about how to evaluate historical cases of rapid political change.

  pages = {318--326},
  doi = {10.54097/3tb0vh24},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chen examines historical cases of democratic collapse, particularly Weimar, arguing that failures result not solely from economic crises or extremism but from inherent contradictions within democratic ideology that make democracies vulnerable during crises. She contends democracies are harder to defend than autocracies when foundational assumptions are challenged, explaining popular support for authoritarian alternatives.

  RELEVANCE: Contemporary analysis applying historical cases of tradition breakdown to current democratic challenges. Important for understanding how democratic traditions can unravel when their legitimating principles come under stress. Provides evidence on the role of ideological and cultural factors in democratic collapse alongside institutional weaknesses.

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/9781009651028},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Achilles challenges deterministic narratives of Weimar's collapse by recovering contemporaries' sophisticated efforts to make democracy work through pluralistic, conflict-driven processes. She argues Weimar developed a unique form of constitutional patriotism rooted in openness and compromise that has been obscured by the Republic's eventual failure, and that this tradition offers resources for contemporary democratic resilience.

  RELEVANCE: Revisionist account that complicates simplistic narratives of Weimar as inevitable democratic failure. Important for understanding how democratic traditions can be robust even when regimes ultimately collapse, and for distinguishing regime failure from tradition failure. Provides evidence that tradition breakdown is not always predetermined by structural conditions but involves contingent political choices.

  pages = {1089--1118},
  doi = {10.1017/s1479244324000118},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Maier argues that judicial empowerment in Weimar resulted from conservative judges and parties using property rights to rewrite the constitution and limit democratic legislation. This "legal counterrevolution" sought to supersede the written constitution with supra-positive principles, effectively attempting to undo Weimar's democratic revolution through constitutional interpretation rather than political mobilization.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how tradition breakdown can occur through legal and institutional channels rather than dramatic revolutionary rupture. Shows how judicial interpretation and property rights discourse were used to resist democratic transformation and restore elements of the old order. Important for understanding mechanisms of gradual tradition erosion and conservative resistance to new political settlements.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dell'Aguzzo and Diodato examine how international patron-client relations shape authoritarian regimes' responses to popular mobilization, arguing that regimes with democratic patrons are more likely to adopt risky strategies (repression or democratic opening) while those with autocratic patrons choose safer co-optation strategies. This explains divergent outcomes during Arab Spring uprisings.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates the international dimensions of political tradition breakdown and regime survival. Shows how external relationships constrain or enable different responses to internal challenges, affecting whether authoritarian traditions persist or collapse.

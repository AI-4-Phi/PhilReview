====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how traditions break down from within—through
internal contradictions, ossification, loss of rational
self-reflection, or disconnection between practice and theory.
MacIntyre's concept of epistemological crisis provides the
foundational framework: traditions fail when their conceptual
resources can no longer make sense of new challenges or when
internal incoherence undermines their ability to provide narrative
continuity. The literature reveals three primary failure modes:
(1) epistemological crisis when a tradition's scheme of belief
cannot account for novel situations; (2) ossification when living
practices decay into mere convention or ritual; and (3) loss of
practical wisdom (phronesis) when the capacity for sound judgment
within a tradition degenerates. Gadamer's hermeneutical approach
complements this by analyzing how prejudices can become rigid and
authoritative structures can lose their productive tension with
critical reason.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the core research question about
*how* traditions fail internally. Unlike external pressures
(domain 1), these are endogenous pathologies—traditions defeating
themselves through their own internal dynamics. MacIntyre's work
reveals that rational traditions can suffer epistemological crises
that they either successfully navigate (becoming stronger) or fail
to resolve (fragmenting or ossifying). This establishes criteria
for distinguishing healthy from pathological tradition evolution.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses heavily on epistemological aspects of
tradition failure but gives less attention to the concrete
mechanisms of practical degeneration—the day-to-day processes by
which living practices become dead rituals. There is also limited
empirical analysis of contemporary political traditions undergoing
epistemological crisis. Most examples are historical or religious
rather than political.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework as the
central concept, then branch into specific failure mechanisms:
internal contradiction (Lutz, Herdt), ossification versus healthy
evolution (Angier, Lott), and phronesis decline (MacIntyre on
practices). Use Gadamer to analyze the role of prejudice and
authority in both enabling and constraining tradition rationality.
The synthesis should culminate in criteria for diagnosing tradition
pathology.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- MacIntyrean epistemological crisis: 8 papers - Tradition failure
  as narrative/conceptual incoherence requiring reconstruction
- Gadamerian hermeneutics: 3 papers - Prejudice and authority as
  productive yet potentially ossifying
- Practice degeneration: 4 papers - Loss of internal goods and
  corruption of practices
- Rationality debates: 3 papers - Can tradition-based rationality
  avoid relativism and self-contradiction

  doi = {10.5840/monist197760427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defines epistemological crisis as occurring when an agent's conceptual scheme fails to make intelligible what they encounter, requiring narrative reconstruction to resolve. Crisis resolution involves creating a new narrative that explains both the old inadequate scheme and why it failed—making the crisis itself intelligible. In traditions of inquiry, crises arise when established methods cannot account for accumulating anomalies, demanding fundamental reconceptualization.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the concept central to understanding tradition breakdown. MacIntyre shows that traditions don't simply "stagnate"—they face specific crises of intelligibility when their conceptual resources prove inadequate. This provides precise analytical tools for identifying when a tradition is failing versus when it is undergoing productive transformation. The paper distinguishes genuine crisis (requiring fundamental reconceptualization) from routine problem-solving, crucial for the research project's investigation of breakdown mechanisms.

  POSITION: MacIntyrean tradition-constituted rationality—emphasizes that rational traditions must be able to account for their own crises and failures through narrative reconstruction.

  title = {Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  year = {1990},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctvpj75tx},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents three rival conceptions of moral inquiry in conflict: the Encyclopaedia tradition (claiming universal rational foundations), Genealogy (Nietzschean deconstruction revealing power behind truth-claims), and Tradition (particularist rationality embedded in practices). Argues that only tradition-based inquiry can coherently account for its own standards while remaining open to rational revision. Internal contradictions doom both Encyclopaedia (cannot ground its universalism) and Genealogy (self-undermining skepticism).

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how traditions of inquiry succeed or fail based on their ability to handle internal contradictions and epistemological crises. The Encyclopaedia tradition's collapse illustrates how failure to acknowledge one's own tradition-embeddedness leads to incoherence. This provides conceptual resources for analyzing when political traditions become internally contradictory—particularly traditions claiming universal foundations while operating within particular frameworks.

  POSITION: Argues for tradition-constituted rationality as superior to both universalist and genealogical alternatives—traditions succeed when they can critically examine their own assumptions.

@book{lutz2004tradition,
  author = {Lutz, Christopher Stephen},
  title = {Tradition in the Ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre: Relativism, Thomism, and Philosophy},
  publisher = {Lexington Books},
  year = {2004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive analysis of MacIntyre's theory of tradition-constituted rationality, defending it against charges of relativism while examining potential internal tensions. Argues that MacIntyre successfully shows how traditions can be rationally compared despite lacking tradition-neutral standards, but identifies residual tensions between his historicism and his Thomistic commitments to objective truth. Explores whether tradition-based rationality can coherently ground universal moral claims.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the question of when tradition-based rationality becomes internally incoherent. Lutz identifies the potential self-contradiction: if all rationality is tradition-dependent, how can one tradition claim superiority? This maps onto the research question about internal tradition failure—traditions may collapse under the weight of their own epistemological commitments. The book provides sophisticated analysis of the internal coherence requirements for successful traditions.

  POSITION: Defends MacIntyre against relativism charges while acknowledging unresolved tensions—argues tradition rationality requires both particularity and openness to universal truth.

  title = {Alasdair MacIntyre's "Rationality of Traditions" and Tradition-Transcendental Standards of Justification},
  journal = {The Journal of Religion},
  year = {1998},
  volume = {78},
  number = {4},
  pages = {524--546},
  doi = {10.1086/490289},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically examines whether MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality can escape charges of self-reference and provide genuine justification. Argues that MacIntyre's claim that traditions can rationally defeat rivals requires covert appeal to tradition-transcendent standards, creating internal inconsistency. If all rationality is tradition-bound, the criteria for judging one tradition superior to another must themselves be tradition-relative, undermining claims of rational superiority.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies a potential fatal internal contradiction in tradition-based rationality: the self-reference problem. This is directly relevant to understanding how traditions fail from within—if a tradition's epistemological commitments are self-undermining, it faces inevitable crisis. Herdt's analysis reveals that traditions claiming both radical particularity and rational superiority may be internally incoherent, a key mechanism of breakdown.

  POSITION: Critical of MacIntyre—argues his account requires hidden universalist assumptions that contradict his historicist commitments, revealing potential internal contradiction.

  number = {3},
  pages = {315--339},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-9795.00111},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends MacIntyre against charges of self-contradiction and self-reference paradox. Argues that MacIntyre's account of tradition-based rationality is not self-refuting because it acknowledges its own tradition-embeddedness while providing resources for rational comparison between traditions. Successful traditions are those that can critically examine their own presuppositions without requiring a tradition-neutral standpoint.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses internal coherence requirements for tradition rationality—how can traditions be both particular and rationally defensible? Lott's analysis distinguishes healthy self-reflection (tradition examining itself) from pathological self-reference (tradition undermining its own foundations). This distinction is crucial for understanding when traditions successfully navigate crises versus when they collapse into incoherence or dogmatism.

  POSITION: Defends MacIntyre—argues tradition-constituted rationality avoids self-contradiction through dialectical engagement with rival traditions while maintaining internal coherence.

  number = {4},
  pages = {540--572},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1468-0378.2011.00505.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes MacIntyre's conception of tradition as "argument extended through time," examining conditions for tradition vitality versus stagnation. Argues that living traditions are characterized by ongoing internal debate about their own standards and purposes, while failed traditions ossify into unreflective conformity to established patterns. The capacity for self-criticism without self-destruction marks healthy tradition evolution.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the distinction between living and dead traditions—a central concern for understanding internal failure mechanisms. Angier identifies ossification as occurring when a tradition loses capacity for genuine argument about its own goods and purposes, instead enforcing conformity to inherited patterns. This provides criteria for diagnosing when political traditions have degenerated from living arguments into dead conventions.

  POSITION: Emphasizes tradition vitality requires ongoing internal contestation and capacity for rational revision—stagnation occurs when argument ceases.

  number = {20},
  pages = {115--129},
  doi = {10.34024/prometeica.2020.20.10021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework to Marxian economics, arguing it has been defeated as a tradition of inquiry. Claims that Marxian economics cannot account for its systematic predictive failures or coherently respond to internal contradictions exposed by critics, marking genuine epistemological crisis. The tradition lacks resources to narratively reconstruct itself while preserving continuity with its core commitments.

  RELEVANCE: Provides concrete contemporary example of tradition undergoing epistemological crisis and failure. Demonstrates how a tradition can collapse when it cannot make its own failures intelligible or resolve internal contradictions between theoretical commitments and empirical anomalies. This exemplifies the research project's focus on internal breakdown mechanisms—Marxian economics defeated not primarily by external opposition but by inability to resolve its own crises.

  POSITION: Applies MacIntyrean epistemological crisis framework to argue a specific tradition (Marxian economics) has failed—unable to resolve internal contradictions.

  volume = {45},
  number = {5},
  pages = {581--597},
  doi = {10.1093/jmp/jhaa026},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework to analyze modern psychiatry's diagnostic practices. Argues the DSM emerged in response to 1970s epistemological crisis threatening psychiatry's scientific authority, but now faces renewed crisis as its conceptual framework proves inadequate for new challenges. Calls for epistemological humility—acknowledging limitations of current diagnostic paradigm before future crisis destabilizes the field entirely.

  RELEVANCE: Contemporary applied example of epistemological crisis in professional practice tradition. Shows how traditions respond to crisis sometimes by creating rigid frameworks (DSM) that temporarily stabilize practice but may ossify into dogma, setting up future crisis. Relevant to understanding how political traditions might similarly respond to crisis through rigid codification that creates appearance of stability while undermining adaptive capacity.

  POSITION: Applies epistemological crisis framework to psychiatric practice—argues current paradigm shows signs of crisis requiring fundamental rethinking.

  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.24193/subbphil.2023.sp.iss.03},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies MacIntyre's intelligibility crisis concept to Yugoslav national narrative, analyzing how people lost ability to make sense of their actions when moving from pre-Yugoslav to Yugoslav to post-Yugoslav contexts. Intelligibility crisis occurs when individuals cannot connect themselves with new social context, losing the narrative continuity that makes actions meaningful. Shows how tradition breakdown creates existential disorientation.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates real-world political consequences when tradition's narrative framework collapses—people unable to make their own lives intelligible. This connects tradition failure to practical breakdown: when political traditions lose narrative coherence, they cease providing the conceptual resources citizens need to understand their roles and purposes. The Yugoslav case shows how rapid narrative shifts can trigger intelligibility crises at mass scale.

  POSITION: Applies MacIntyrean framework to political tradition breakdown—emphasizes that tradition failure produces loss of meaning and intelligibility.

@article{gadamer1960truth,
  author = {Gadamer, Hans-Georg},
  title = {Truth and Method},
  year = {1960},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops philosophical hermeneutics emphasizing that understanding always occurs within tradition through prejudices (pre-judgments). Argues Enlightenment's blanket rejection of prejudice was itself a prejudice—legitimate prejudices enable understanding by providing the horizon from which we interpret. Authority and tradition are not inherently opposed to reason but can be sources of genuine insight. However, prejudices must remain open to revision through dialogue and "fusion of horizons."

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative framework to MacIntyre for understanding tradition's role in rationality, emphasizing how prejudices can be both enabling and limiting. Relevant to tradition breakdown: when prejudices ossify into dogma that resists dialogical revision, tradition loses its productive character. The concept of "fusion of horizons" suggests traditions fail when they can no longer engage in genuine dialogue with novel perspectives or challenges.

  POSITION: Gadamerian hermeneutics—tradition and prejudice are conditions of understanding, but must remain open to dialogical revision to avoid ossification.

  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.46793/felixr24.16am},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Explicates Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice, authority, and tradition as legitimate sources of knowledge, not obstacles to truth. Prejudices structure our understanding but are not fixed—they can be tested and revised through hermeneutic experience. Authority rests not on domination but on acknowledgment of superior knowledge. Tradition is the medium of understanding, providing the pre-understandings necessary for interpretation.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies how prejudice and authority function productively in traditions while identifying conditions for their pathology. When authority becomes mere domination (rather than acknowledged expertise) or when prejudices become immune to revision, tradition degenerates. This provides criteria for distinguishing healthy tradition (open prejudices, legitimate authority) from pathological tradition (dogmatic prejudices, dominating authority).

  POSITION: Explicates Gadamerian view that prejudice and authority are properly understood as enabling rather than obstructing knowledge, when functioning healthily.

@article{atkinson2014gadamer,
  author = {Atkinson, Camille Elise},
  title = {Gadamer, Tradition and Subjectivity},
  year = {2014},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines criticisms of Gadamer's account of tradition from two opposing directions: conservatives charge him with undermining truth through relativistic emphasis on interpreter's prejudices, while progressives accuse him of validating oppressive power structures by insufficiently criticizing tradition. Argues Gadamer's position actually navigates between these extremes, showing how tradition enables critical reflection rather than simply constraining it.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the tension between tradition as enabling and tradition as constraining—directly relevant to understanding tradition pathology. The dual critique reveals how traditions can fail in opposite directions: either ossifying into dogma that resists critical reflection or dissolving into subjectivism that abandons claim to truth. Successful traditions maintain productive tension between inheritance and critique.

  POSITION: Defends Gadamer's middle position—tradition both enables and constrains, requiring ongoing dialogue between inheritance and critical reflection.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive exposition of MacIntyre's philosophical development and mature position on tradition-constituted rationality. Traces evolution from early Marxism through epistemological crisis to Thomistic Aristotelianism. Argues MacIntyre shows how traditions of inquiry can be rationally compared despite lacking neutral standards, through their capacity to solve problems internal to rival traditions and to provide narrative account of their own development.

  RELEVANCE: Synthesizes MacIntyre's full account of tradition rationality, providing resources for understanding both how traditions succeed and how they fail. D'Andrea's comprehensive treatment illuminates the internal standards by which traditions judge themselves and can be judged—crucial for diagnosing tradition pathology. The book explicates how living traditions maintain coherence through ongoing argument about their own goods and purposes.

  number = {3},
  pages = {251--273},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-005-0558-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines MacIntyre's defense against relativism charges, focusing on his account of how traditions can be rationally compared. Argues that MacIntyre's notion of epistemological crisis provides mechanism for rational tradition comparison: a tradition demonstrates superiority by solving problems that rival tradition cannot solve with its own resources, while also explaining why the rival tradition failed. This avoids both absolutism and relativism.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the rational standards internal to traditions that allow diagnosis of failure. When a tradition cannot solve problems with its own resources and cannot narratively account for its failures, it is objectively failing by its own standards. This provides non-relativistic criteria for identifying tradition breakdown—traditions can genuinely fail to meet their own rational requirements.

  POSITION: Defends MacIntyre against relativism—argues tradition-constituted rationality provides genuine (not merely relative) standards for assessing tradition success or failure.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends MacIntyre's account of tradition-based rationality against critics who claim it collapses into relativism or incoherence. Argues that traditions can maintain both particularity and rationality through their capacity for internal criticism and dialectical engagement with rivals. The rationality of a tradition consists in its ability to resolve its own internal problems and to provide resources for ongoing inquiry.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses fundamental question of whether tradition-based rationality is coherent or self-defeating—crucial for understanding when traditions genuinely fail versus when they are merely criticized from external standpoints. Seipel's defense suggests that traditions fail when they lose capacity for internal criticism and problem-solving, not simply when they maintain particular commitments.

  number = {4},
  pages = {619--640},
  doi = {10.5840/acpq201492234},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes tradition as fragile practice vulnerable to breakdown through multiple pathways. Argues that traditions depend on practices that can be corrupted, practitioners who can lose relevant virtues, and institutions that can subordinate internal goods to external goods. Tradition vitality requires maintaining practices in good order, cultivating practical wisdom in practitioners, and preventing institutional corruption—all vulnerable to failure.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies concrete mechanisms of tradition breakdown beyond purely epistemological crisis: practice corruption, virtue loss, and institutional decay. This expands understanding of internal failure modes—traditions don't only fail through logical incoherence but through degeneration of the practices that constitute them. The fragility framework reveals how multiple simultaneous failures can compound into tradition collapse.

  POSITION: Emphasizes fragility of traditions—they succeed only when multiple conditions (practice integrity, virtue cultivation, institutional support) are maintained.

  pages = {15--35},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares Gadamer's and MacIntyre's accounts of tradition, finding convergence on tradition as resource for rationality rather than obstacle. Both reject Enlightenment assumption that tradition and reason are opposed, instead showing how tradition provides the conceptual resources for rational inquiry. However, they differ on tradition's dynamism: Gadamer emphasizes ongoing dialogue and fusion of horizons, while MacIntyre focuses on epistemological crisis and rational reconstruction.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates complementary perspectives on tradition rationality and failure. Gadamer's dialogical model suggests traditions fail when they lose capacity for "fusion of horizons" with novel perspectives. MacIntyre's crisis model emphasizes that traditions fail when they cannot narratively reconstruct themselves after fundamental challenges. Together they provide richer account of tradition breakdown mechanisms.

  doi = {10.17990/rpf/2024_80_1_0585},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces MacIntyre's intellectual journey from Marxism through epistemological crisis to Aristotelianism, analyzing how his own experience exemplifies tradition-constituted rationality and crisis resolution. MacIntyre's abandonment of Marxism resulted from recognizing its inability to provide coherent account of individual and common good or to resolve tensions between theory and practice. His turn to Aristotelian tradition resolved these crises by providing richer conceptual resources.

  RELEVANCE: Provides autobiographical case study of epistemological crisis and tradition transition. MacIntyre's own intellectual development illustrates the dynamics of tradition failure and reconstruction he theorizes. His experience shows how a tradition (Marxism) can fail to provide adequate account of fundamental questions (human telos, common good), precipitating crisis that requires moving to a different tradition with superior resources.

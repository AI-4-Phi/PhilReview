====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes foundational accounts of what traditions are and
how they function philosophically. The dominant twentieth-century discourse
positions tradition not as static inheritance but as living, dynamic
practice requiring ongoing interpretation. Three major strands emerge:
(1) MacIntyre's practice-based account linking tradition to rationality and
virtue through socially embodied activities; (2) Gadamer's hermeneutic view
positioning tradition as the medium enabling understanding through prejudice
and effective history; (3) Oakeshott's conservative critique of rationalism
defending tradition as practical knowledge irreducible to technical rules.
Earlier theorists like Shils and Polanyi provide sociological and
epistemological grounding for tradition as tacit knowledge and social
continuity. Recent work explores tensions between tradition and critical
reason, tradition's role in identity formation, and whether tradition-based
frameworks can accommodate genuine critique or inherently conserve existing
power structures.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Understanding how traditions function internally—through practices,
rationality, hermeneutic horizons, and tacit knowledge—is essential for
analyzing how they break down. These theories identify the structural
features that enable tradition persistence: rational inquiry within shared
frameworks (MacIntyre), prejudices enabling understanding (Gadamer),
practical knowledge embedded in activity (Oakeshott), and mechanisms of
intergenerational transmission (Shils). Each account implicitly identifies
points of fragility: what happens when practices corrupt, when prejudices
become obstacles, when practical knowledge cannot adapt, or when
transmission mechanisms fail.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While these theories explain tradition maintenance, they provide limited
explicit analysis of tradition breakdown mechanisms. MacIntyre's concept of
"epistemological crisis" offers the most developed account, but systematic
treatment of degeneration, corruption, or dissolution remains underdeveloped
in this literature. The relationship between tradition and modernity
(rationalization, individualism, pluralism) is often implied but rarely
theorized as a breakdown process.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
MacIntyre and Gadamer should be positioned as offering complementary rather
than competing accounts—practices versus hermeneutic understanding represent
different dimensions of tradition. Oakeshott provides crucial conservative
counterpoint emphasizing limits of theoretical articulation. Shils and
Polanyi ground these philosophical accounts in sociological and
epistemological terms. Secondary literature on epistemological crisis,
tradition-constituted rationality, and critique within traditions will be
essential for connecting this domain to breakdown analysis.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Practice-based accounts: 9 papers - Tradition as socially embodied
  practices with internal goods and standards (MacIntyre and followers)
- Hermeneutic accounts: 5 papers - Tradition as prejudice-laden
  interpretive horizon enabling understanding (Gadamer and followers)
- Conservative epistemology: 4 papers - Tradition as practical knowledge
  resistant to rationalist reduction (Oakeshott, Polanyi)

@book{macintyre1981after,
  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory},
  year = {1981},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  edition = {1st},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The Enlightenment project of justifying morality through
  universal reason failed because it severed moral concepts from their
  grounding in social practices and traditions. MacIntyre argues that
  virtues can only be understood within the context of practices (coherent
  social activities with internal goods), narrative unity of individual
  lives, and living moral traditions that extend practices historically.
  Modernity's fragmentation of moral discourse into incommensurable
  positions (emotivism) results from abandoning tradition-based frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the practice-tradition-virtue
  nexus central to contemporary philosophical accounts of tradition. The
  concept of practice—with its internal goods and standards of
  excellence—provides a structural account of how traditions maintain
  coherence and transmit normative content. Critically, MacIntyre's
  diagnosis of modernity as fragmentation of traditions establishes the
  conceptual space for analyzing tradition breakdown, though he focuses more
  on recovery than on mechanisms of degeneration.

  POSITION: Virtue ethics, communitarianism, anti-Enlightenment critique.
  Represents the practice-based approach to tradition emphasizing embodied
  social activity over abstract principles.

  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {Whose Justice? Which Rationality?},
  year = {1988},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  doi = {10.2307/2074148},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rationality itself is tradition-constituted; there is no
  neutral, tradition-independent standpoint from which to adjudicate between
  rival conceptions of justice and practical rationality. Each tradition
  (Aristotelian, Augustinian, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal) embodies
  distinct conceptions of goods, virtues, and rational inquiry. Traditions
  progress through engaging internal incoherences and "epistemological
  crises" when their conceptual resources fail to account for experience.
  Genuine rational comparison between traditions is possible when one
  tradition can explain the limitations of its rival better than that rival
  can explain itself.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how traditions structure
  rationality and how they can fail. The concept of "epistemological crisis"
  provides the most developed philosophical account of tradition breakdown:
  the moment when a tradition's conceptual resources prove inadequate to
  make sense of experience or solve problems it previously could address.
  MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality directly informs
  analysis of why tradition breakdown is not mere external destruction but
  internal rational failure—the tradition's inability to sustain its own
  standards of inquiry.

  POSITION: Historically-informed epistemology; tradition-constituted
  rationality. Establishes framework for understanding both tradition
  resilience (through successful engagement with crises) and tradition
  collapse (through failure to resolve epistemological crises).

  title = {Wahrheit und Methode: Grundz{\"u}ge einer philosophischen Hermeneutik},
  year = {1960},
  publisher = {Mohr Siebeck},
  address = {T{\"u}bingen},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Understanding is always mediated by tradition through
  "prejudices" (pre-judgments) and "effective history" that shape
  interpretive horizons. Against Enlightenment rationalism's "prejudice
  against prejudice," Gadamer rehabilitates prejudice as the enabling
  condition of understanding rather than obstacle to it. Tradition is not
  an object to be grasped by detached reason but the medium within which
  understanding occurs. The hermeneutic circle—understanding parts through
  wholes and wholes through parts—characterizes all interpretation,
  including self-understanding within traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for hermeneutic accounts of tradition emphasizing
  how traditions constitute interpretive frameworks rather than mere content
  to be transmitted. Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice and authority
  provides philosophical legitimation for tradition's enabling role in
  rationality—complementing MacIntyre's practice-based account by focusing
  on hermeneutic understanding. Critically, Gadamer's framework raises
  questions about tradition breakdown: if traditions are constitutive of
  understanding, how can they be critically assessed? When do
  tradition-enabling prejudices become tradition-disabling blindness?

  POSITION: Philosophical hermeneutics, critique of Enlightenment
  rationalism. Emphasizes tradition as interpretive medium enabling
  understanding through historically-effected consciousness.

@book{oakeshott1962rationalism,
  author = {Oakeshott, Michael},
  title = {Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays},
  year = {1962},
  publisher = {Methuen},
  address = {London},
  doi = {10.2307/2955514},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: "Rationalism in politics" represents a dangerous
  misconception that political wisdom can be reduced to explicit principles
  (technical knowledge) and applied universally. Genuine political knowledge
  is primarily "practical knowledge"—traditional, contextual understanding
  embedded in customs, habits, and concrete activities that cannot be fully
  articulated or codified. Rationalists mistakenly believe that eliminating
  tradition and rebuilding institutions from abstract principles will
  improve politics, but they destroy irreplaceable practical knowledge
  accumulated through generations of adaptation.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conservative epistemological defense of tradition
  emphasizing the limits of explicit rationality and the indispensability of
  tacit, practice-embedded knowledge. Oakeshott's critique of rationalism
  identifies a key mechanism of tradition breakdown: attempts to replace
  practical knowledge with technical knowledge destroy the very forms of
  understanding traditions preserve. His distinction between technical and
  practical knowledge parallels Polanyi's tacit knowledge, offering
  resources for analyzing how modernizing rationalization dissolves
  traditional competencies that cannot be explicitly transmitted or
  institutionally codified.

  POSITION: Conservative political philosophy, critique of rationalism and
  ideology. Defends tradition as repository of practical knowledge
  irreducible to theoretical principles.

  title = {Tradition, Rationality, and Virtue: The Thought of Alasdair MacIntyre},
  year = {2006},
  publisher = {Ashgate},
  address = {Aldershot},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315235851},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive study systematically analyzes MacIntyre's
  intellectual development across ethics, social theory, Marxism, and
  philosophy of religion. D'Andrea explicates the conceptual architecture
  connecting practices, narrative, and tradition in MacIntyre's virtue
  ethics, demonstrating how tradition-constituted rationality resolves
  tensions between historicism and relativism. The book traces MacIntyre's
  evolution from early Marxist critique through Thomistic Aristotelianism,
  showing how the concept of tradition provides coherence across these
  phases.

  RELEVANCE: Essential secondary literature providing systematic exposition
  of MacIntyre's mature position on tradition-constituted rationality. Helps
  clarify how MacIntyre's concepts of practice, narrative unity, and
  tradition form an integrated theory rather than disconnected elements.
  Particularly valuable for understanding how traditions can be both
  historically particular and rationally progressive through internal
  critique and engagement with epistemological crises—directly relevant to
  understanding tradition resilience versus breakdown.

  POSITION: Sympathetic exposition and defense of MacIntyrean virtue ethics
  and tradition-based rationality, positioning it as viable alternative to
  both liberal individualism and postmodern relativism.

@book{warnke1987gadamer,
  author = {Warnke, Georgia},
  title = {Gadamer: Hermeneutics, Tradition and Reason},
  year = {1987},
  publisher = {Stanford University Press},
  address = {Stanford, CA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Warnke defends Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics against
  charges of conservatism and relativism by showing how tradition enables
  rather than constrains critical reason. While Gadamer emphasizes
  tradition's constitutive role in understanding, this does not preclude
  rational critique—rather, critique operates within hermeneutic horizons
  shaped by tradition. The "fusion of horizons" through dialogue allows for
  transformation of prejudices without requiring impossible escape from
  tradition entirely. Tradition is neither static authority nor arbitrary
  starting point but living medium of ongoing interpretive engagement.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses central tension in tradition theory: how can
  tradition-constituted understanding accommodate critique of tradition
  itself? Warnke's defense of Gadamer against conservatism charges directly
  engages the question of whether traditions inherently resist transformation
  or can incorporate self-critical reflection. This bears on tradition
  breakdown: are failing traditions those that lose capacity for
  self-criticism, or those that abandon traditional grounding entirely? The
  fusion of horizons concept suggests traditions break down when dialogue
  and interpretive transformation cease.

  POSITION: Sympathetic interpretation of Gadamer reconciling hermeneutic
  philosophy with critical rationality and defending against both
  conservative and relativist readings.

@article{lutz2014tradition,
  author = {Lutz, Christopher Stephen},
  title = {Tradition as a Fragile Practice: Some Implications of Alasdair MacIntyre's Theory of Rationality for the Study of Philosophy},
  journal = {American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {88},
  pages = {619--640},
  doi = {10.5840/acpq201492234},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lutz argues that MacIntyre's account reveals traditions to
  be fundamentally fragile, not robust, because they depend on active
  practice-engagement and rational inquiry rather than passive transmission
  of content. Traditions survive only through continuous re-appropriation by
  practitioners who must both master inherited standards and extend inquiry
  into new problems. The practice-dependence of traditions means they can
  degenerate when practices corrupt, when standards of excellence erode, or
  when communities fail to sustain the social conditions enabling
  practice-participation.

  RELEVANCE: Explicitly thematizes tradition fragility within MacIntyre's
  framework, making it particularly relevant to breakdown analysis. Lutz
  identifies structural vulnerabilities: traditions require not just
  historical continuity but active rational inquiry, which can fail. This
  connects directly to the research question by identifying mechanisms of
  breakdown: corruption of practices, erosion of standards, loss of
  community structures supporting practice-participation. Lutz's emphasis on
  fragility corrects triumphalist readings of MacIntyre that emphasize only
  tradition resilience.

  POSITION: Critical interpretation of MacIntyre emphasizing vulnerability
  rather than stability of tradition-constituted rationality.

@article{kuna2005macintyre,

  title = {MacIntyre on Tradition, Rationality, and Relativism},
  journal = {Res Publica},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {251--273},
  doi = {10.1007/S11158-005-0558-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kuna examines whether MacIntyre's tradition-constituted
  rationality escapes relativism or merely obscures it. While MacIntyre
  argues that rational comparison between traditions is possible when one
  tradition can explain another's limitations better than that tradition can
  explain itself, Kuna questions whether this criterion is sufficiently
  robust. The problem of incommensurability between traditions may be deeper
  than MacIntyre acknowledges: if rationality standards themselves are
  tradition-internal, cross-tradition rational adjudication faces persistent
  circularities.

  RELEVANCE: Engages the theoretical adequacy of MacIntyre's framework for
  understanding tradition comparison and potential breakdown. If relativism
  is inescapable, then "tradition breakdown" may be indistinguishable from
  "tradition transformation" or "tradition replacement"—there would be no
  rational standpoint from which to judge one outcome superior. Conversely,
  if MacIntyre succeeds in showing genuine cross-tradition rational
  comparison, this provides resources for analyzing when traditions fail by
  their own standards versus when they are displaced by rationally superior
  alternatives.

  POSITION: Critical assessment of MacIntyre questioning whether
  tradition-constituted rationality successfully avoids relativism.

  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.46793/felixr24.16am},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mili{\'c} explicates Gadamer's controversial rehabilitation
  of prejudice, authority, and tradition as legitimate sources of
  understanding rather than obstacles to truth. Gadamer's critique of
  Enlightenment rationalism shows that the "prejudice against prejudice"
  itself reflects historical bias. Pre-judgments (Vorurteile) shaped by
  tradition are not arbitrary but carry accumulated wisdom tested through
  effective history. Authority is not blind submission but recognition of
  superior judgment. Tradition is not dead weight but living transmission
  enabling understanding.

  RELEVANCE: Recent restatement of Gadamer's core hermeneutic theses,
  valuable for understanding how traditions function as enabling rather than
  constraining frameworks. The rehabilitation of prejudice and authority
  connects to breakdown analysis: when do legitimate authority and
  tradition-grounded prejudice become illegitimate domination and distorting
  bias? Gadamer's framework suggests breakdown occurs not through abandoning
  tradition but through failure of hermeneutic engagement—when prejudices
  ossify into dogmas resistant to dialogical transformation through
  encounter with different horizons.

  POSITION: Sympathetic exposition of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy with
  attention to its implications for understanding tradition's role in
  rationality.

  booktitle = {Tradition vs. Rationalism},
  editor = {Callahan, Gene and Trepanier, Lee},
  publisher = {Lexington Books},
  address = {Lanham, MD},
  year = {2016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander compares three distinct twentieth-century
  philosophical accounts of tradition: Arendt's narrative of lost tradition
  (the thread connecting past and present has broken), Oakeshott's defense
  of tradition as practical knowledge irreducible to rationalist
  reconstruction, and MacIntyre's practice-based account of living
  traditions requiring rational inquiry. While Arendt mourns tradition's
  collapse, Oakeshott defends what remains, and MacIntyre seeks recovery
  through renewed engagement with tradition-constituted rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the research question by comparing how three
  major thinkers conceptualize tradition and its potential breakdown.
  Arendt's account of tradition's rupture in modernity provides explicit
  breakdown narrative, while Oakeshott emphasizes erosion through rationalist
  assault, and MacIntyre offers framework for distinguishing genuine
  tradition from degenerate simulacra. The comparison reveals different
  dimensions of breakdown: catastrophic rupture (Arendt), gradual erosion
  (Oakeshott), internal corruption versus rational transformation
  (MacIntyre).

  understanding tradition and its potential failure in modernity.

  journal = {Political Theory},
  year = {1990},
  volume = {18},
  number = {3},
  pages = {411--436},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Franco challenges common interpretations of Oakeshott as
  straightforward conservative by showing how his political philosophy,
  especially his concept of "civil association," aligns with liberal values
  of individual freedom and rule of law. Oakeshott's critique of
  "rationalism in politics" targets not reason per se but the ideological
  subordination of politics to single substantive purposes. His defense of
  tradition is not reactionary nostalgia but recognition that political
  freedom requires practices and understandings that cannot be manufactured
  through abstract design.

  RELEVANCE: Complicates the understanding of Oakeshott's relationship to
  tradition by showing his defense is compatible with, indeed requires,
  individual liberty and limited government. This suggests that tradition
  breakdown, from Oakeshott's perspective, occurs not simply through change
  or reform but specifically through rationalist attempts to replace
  inherited political understandings with ideologically-driven projects.
  Franco's interpretation helps distinguish Oakeshott's position from crude
  conservatism that simply resists change.

  POSITION: Reinterprets Oakeshott as reconciling traditional political
  knowledge with liberal commitments to individual freedom.

@book{shils1981tradition,
  author = {Shils, Edward},
  title = {Tradition},
  year = {1981},
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shils provides sociological account of tradition as
  patterns of belief and practice transmitted across generations through
  mechanisms of authority, charisma, and institutional routines. Traditions
  are not static entities but living processes requiring active reproduction
  by each generation. All societies require traditions to function; even
  revolutionary movements create new traditions while claiming to break with
  the past. The tension between tradition and modernity is not simple
  opposition but complex negotiation in which modern institutions themselves
  become traditiona lized.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational sociological analysis providing empirical grounding
  for philosophical accounts of tradition. Shils identifies social mechanisms
  of tradition maintenance and transmission: authority structures,
  institutional carriers, educational systems, ritual practices. This
  sociological perspective directly informs breakdown analysis by identifying
  concrete structures whose erosion or transformation disrupts traditional
  continuity. Shils's emphasis on tradition's necessity for social order
  suggests breakdown has wide-ranging consequences beyond loss of particular
  content.

  POSITION: Sociological functionalism applied to tradition, emphasizing
  necessity of tradition for social integration while acknowledging
  tradition's historical variability.

@book{polanyi1958personal,
  author = {Polanyi, Michael},
  title = {Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy},
  year = {1958},
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: All knowledge, including scientific knowledge, rests on a
  foundation of "tacit knowledge"—skills, judgments, and understandings that
  cannot be fully articulated or transmitted through explicit rules. This
  tacit dimension is learned through apprenticeship within traditions of
  practice, not through formal instruction alone. The ideal of perfectly
  explicit, impersonal knowledge is impossible; all knowing requires personal
  judgment grounded in inherited frameworks. Tradition is not obstacle to
  genuine knowledge but its necessary condition.

  RELEVANCE: Provides epistemological foundation for practice-based and
  conservative accounts of tradition by demonstrating the ineliminability of
  tacit knowledge. Polanyi's framework directly supports Oakeshott's
  distinction between technical and practical knowledge while complementing
  MacIntyre's emphasis on practice-embedded standards. For breakdown
  analysis, Polanyi's account suggests traditions fail when mechanisms
  transmitting tacit knowledge are disrupted—when apprenticeship relations
  dissolve, when explicit codification replaces embodied competence, or when
  communities of practice fragment.

  necessity of tradition-based apprenticeship for knowledge transmission.

  journal = {Philosophy Today},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {46},
  pages = {25--37},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Atkinson defends Gadamer against critics (Warnke, Caputo)
  who argue his emphasis on tradition makes his hermeneutics inherently
  conservative and incapable of genuine critique. She argues that Gadamer's
  rehabilitation of prejudice and tradition does not entail uncritical
  acceptance of authority but rather recognizes that all understanding,
  including critical understanding, operates within historically-effected
  consciousness. The fusion of horizons enables transformation of prejudices,
  not their preservation. Tradition is living dialogue, not static
  authority.

  RELEVANCE: Directly engages the question of whether tradition-based
  frameworks can accommodate critique or inherently conserve existing
  arrangements. This is essential for breakdown analysis: if Gadamer's
  critics are right, traditions cannot self-critically recognize their own
  failures and breakdown becomes explicable only through external critique
  or revolutionary rupture. If Atkinson is right, traditions can recognize
  internal inadequacies, suggesting breakdown may result from failure of
  hermeneutic engagement rather than impossibility of tradition-internal
  critique.

  hermeneutic philosophy accommodates critical transformation of tradition.

  volume = {30},
  pages = {315--339},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-9795.00111},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lott examines potential self-referential problems in
  MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality. If rationality
  is always tradition-based, does MacIntyre's own philosophical analysis
  depend on some particular tradition's standards? If so, how can it claim
  universal validity? Lott argues MacIntyre can avoid this problem by
  showing how his analysis emerges from within a specific philosophical
  tradition (Thomistic Aristotelianism) while nonetheless providing resources
  for cross-tradition rational comparison through the concept of
  epistemological crisis.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses methodological adequacy of tradition-based approaches
  to analyzing traditions. For breakdown analysis, this raises the question:
  from what standpoint can tradition breakdown be recognized and diagnosed?
  If the analyst must stand within some tradition, can objective assessment
  of tradition failure occur? Lott's resolution through epistemological
  crisis concept suggests breakdown can be recognized from within when
  traditions fail by their own standards—providing grounds for immanent
  rather than merely external critique.

  volume = {34},
  pages = {158--170},
  doi = {10.1177/0953946820984077},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cloutier explicates MacIntyre's late concept of
  "sociological self-knowledge" as essential for adjudicating moral
  disagreements within and between traditions. Understanding one's social
  location and the structural conditions shaping practices is necessary for
  recognizing when apparent disagreements reflect genuine moral differences
  versus different social contexts. Critical realist sociology can provide
  the kind of structural analysis MacIntyre's virtue ethics requires for
  practical application.

  RELEVANCE: Extends MacIntyre's framework by emphasizing social-structural
  analysis as necessary for understanding tradition function and dysfunction.
  For breakdown analysis, this suggests traditions fail not only through
  internal conceptual inadequacies but also through social-structural
  conditions that undermine practices: economic arrangements that corrupt
  internal goods, institutional forms that prevent practice-participation,
  or power relations that distort tradition-constituted inquiry. Connects
  philosophical tradition theory to sociological analysis of structural
  conditions.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bishop applies MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted
  rationality to bioethics debates over female circumcision, arguing that
  modern liberalism's inability to coherently condemn the practice without
  imposing its own tradition-specific values reveals liberalism's own
  tradition-dependence despite its universalist pretensions. Genuine
  cross-cultural moral dialogue requires acknowledging that all positions,
  including liberal ones, emerge from particular traditions with
  historically-specific rationality standards.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates application of MacIntyre's framework to concrete
  ethical controversies, showing how tradition-constituted rationality plays
  out in practice. For breakdown analysis, Bishop's case study reveals how
  traditions encounter limits: when internal conceptual resources cannot
  address new challenges (biomedical technologies, cross-cultural encounter)
  without either betraying core commitments or becoming unintelligible to
  others. Such encounters may precipitate epistemological crises requiring
  tradition transformation or breakdown.

  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.17951/kw.2024.38.107-134},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Flaga critically examines MacIntyre's anti-individualist
  account of how tradition and community constitute individual identity and
  agency. While MacIntyre effectively shows that modern individualism's
  autonomous self is incoherent, Flaga questions whether MacIntyre's
  alternative—the self embedded in practices, narratives, and traditions—
  leaves sufficient room for individual freedom and critical distance from
  community norms. The tradition-constituted self may be as philosophically
  problematic as the liberal autonomous self, merely from opposite direction.

  RELEVANCE: Recent critical engagement with MacIntyre raising concerns
  about individual agency within tradition-based frameworks. For breakdown
  analysis, this highlights potential internal tensions: traditions require
  individual appropriation and inquiry, but if tradition too completely
  constitutes the self, how can individuals recognize tradition's failures
  or initiate needed reforms? Flaga's critique suggests traditions may break
  down when they suppress individual agency required for tradition-sustaining
  inquiry, creating paradox where tradition-maintenance requires
  anti-traditional individuality.

  account of individual subjectivity within tradition-based frameworks.

## Conclusion

This review has examined how political and cultural traditions break down, revealing traditions not as static inheritances but as dynamic processes requiring active appropriation through practices, narratives, and authoritative transmission. The philosophical accounts of MacIntyre (1981, 1988), Gadamer (1960), and Oakeshott (1962) establish that traditions structure rationality itself and transmit knowledge that cannot be fully articulated. Yet this very dependence on continuous practice and interpretation renders traditions fragile: they can fail through epistemological crisis when conceptual resources prove inadequate (MacIntyre 1977), through ossification when argument ceases and conformity is enforced (Angier 2014), through practice corruption when internal goods are subordinated to external rewards (Lutz 2014), through rationalist assault that replaces practical wisdom with technical rules (Scott 2017), through colonial destruction that physically prevents traditional practices (Whyte 2019), and through secularization that transforms traditions from constitutive frameworks into contestable options (Taylor 2007).

The authority-tradition nexus emerges as central to understanding breakdown dynamics. Arendt (1961) demonstrates that tradition and authority are mutually dependent: traditions require authoritative institutions for transmission, while authority derives its legitimacy from connection to a sanctified founding transmitted through tradition. When this connection breaks, authority cannot be restored through rational reconstruction or force. The empirical evidence of declining institutional trust across democracies (Dalton 2005; Seligson 2002) and the contemporary spread of disinformation that undermines epistemic authority (Bennett and Livingston 2018) suggest this mutual collapse continues to accelerate.

Invented traditions exhibit distinctive vulnerabilities, particularly in liberal democratic contexts where commitments to rational justification and free inquiry will eventually expose their fabricated character (Abizadeh 2014). Yet the sharp distinction between organic and invented traditions proves less tenable than Hobsbawm (2012) suggested. As Alexander (2016) argues, all traditions involve selective construction and reconstruction; what matters is whether traditions successfully embed in meaningful practices and maintain adaptive capacity, not their historical authenticity. Conservative and communitarian diagnoses from MacIntyre, Taylor (1991), Sandel (1982), and Scruton (1980) offer rich phenomenological accounts of tradition loss in Western liberal modernity, but their applicability to non-Western contexts remains underexplored, and their frameworks may not adequately address traditions that are themselves oppressive.

The research question thus opens onto significant gaps requiring systematic attention: integrating philosophical tradition theory with empirical historical research, developing criteria distinguishing healthy adaptation from destructive breakdown, incorporating non-Western perspectives on tradition and its failure, and applying tradition-breakdown frameworks to contemporary democratic erosion. A unified account would connect the structural vulnerabilities identified by philosophers with the causal mechanisms documented by historians and sociologists, providing both diagnostic tools for recognizing tradition failure and normative criteria for evaluating when traditions warrant preservation versus when their breakdown enables needed transformation.

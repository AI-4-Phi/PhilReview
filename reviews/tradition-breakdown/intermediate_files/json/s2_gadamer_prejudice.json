      "abstract": "Legal interpretation is often influenced by certain prejudices or preconceptions that are regarded as legitimate in the process of understanding legal texts. These prejudices are not necessarily irrational or unfounded; rather, they form part of the interpreter's horizon, shaped by history, culture, and prior knowledge. This article explores the concept of legitimate prejudice within the realm of legal interpretation, using Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics as its analytical framework. Gadamer\u2019s approach offers a nuanced understanding of how meaning emerges through the fusion of horizons between the legal text and the interpreter\u2019s situated perspective, highlighting the productive role of prejudice in the interpretive process. Gadamer's hermeneutics offers an approach that emphasizes the importance of dialogue between the text, the reader, and its historical context. In the context of legal interpretation, legitimate prejudice is not merely viewed as an obstacle but also as a constructive element that enables the creation of legal meaning that is more relevant to social dynamics. This article examines how Gadamer's \"fusion of horizons\" can help legal practitioners and scholars bridge legal texts with contemporary moral, social, and cultural values. This study employs a normative juridical method combined with a philosophical and hermeneutical approach. The normative juridical method focuses on the analysis of legal norms, principles, and doctrines as they are formulated in legal texts and judicial decisions. Meanwhile, the philosophical approach is used to explore the epistemological foundations of legal interpretation, particularly concerning the role of prejudice and preconceptions in shaping legal meaning. The philosophical approach is used to analyze the concept of prejudice in legal interpretation within the broader framework of legal philosophy and epistemology. Meanwhile, the hermeneutical approach, particularly drawing from Gadamer\u2019s theory, is applied to examine how interpretative prejudices shape and influence the legal decision-making process. This perspective allows for a deeper understanding of how legal meaning is not simply derived from the text itself, but is co-constructed through the interaction between the interpreter\u2019s historical context, normative assumptions, and the legal text. By integrating Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic principles into the practice of legal interpretation, this article aims to contribute to the development of a more inclusive, critical, and value-oriented theory of legal interpretation.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to show how Gadamer highlights the importance that prejudices, authorities and tradition play in the hermeneutic experience, but also to critically review his reasons in support of his position to base his philosophical hermeneutics through them. What Gadamer tries to show with his theory is that prejudices, authorities, and tradition are closely related to many other phenomena that arise during a deeper consideration of interpretation and understanding in general, and which must not be overlooked during this consideration. In the paper, I will first present Gadamer\u2019s motivation for restoring the neutral status of prejudices and placing them in the foundations of his philosophical hermeneutics, then I will present some of the consequences that this understanding has for the hermeneutic procedure, and finally I will show how Gadamer\u2019s understanding of authority and tradition derives from prior examination of prejudice status",

      "abstract": "German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer is best known for his contribution to the development of philosophical hermeneutics, an interpretive approach to knowledge, understanding and meaning-making. It has become a well-established research approach in the health sciences to shed light on the lived experiences of people living with challenging chronic health conditions. Some feminist scholars have gravitated to Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics for its steadfast rejection of positivism and its intention to uncover preunderstandings and prejudices. However, others have critiqued the approach for its lack of focus on prescribing action for social change and its reluctance to evaluate the prejudices present in its own tradition. In this paper, the authors will demonstrate how using feminist hermeneutics can help health researchers deepen their understanding of illness narratives by examining the power structures contributing to the marginalization of chronically ill people within and outside the healthcare system. They will juxtapose a reflexive investigation of the first author\u2019s experiences with a focused literature review of the dialogue between hermeneutics and feminism. By examining the first author\u2019s experiences with Gadamerian hermeneutics and feminist hermeneutics through self-study, she can in turn unearth her own preunderstandings. This approach will allow the authors to leverage the depth of interpretive understanding generated by hermeneutics while exploring the power structures involved in the complex process that is patient care, particularly that of people with chronic illness. They conclude that this combined approach of feminist hermeneutics allows health researchers to deepen their understanding of illness narratives with issue-specific and effective recommendations to clinicians and public health officials, leading to better-adapted services through a more just approach to chronically ill people.",

      "abstract": "Philosophical hermeneutics is a style of hermeneutics that focuses on the ontology of understanding and interpretation. One of the leading exponents of philosophical hermeneutics is Hans-Georg Gadamer. Gadamer explained that the prejudice and historical aspects that accept the dialectics of the past, the present and the future are crucial in understanding religious language related to COVID-19. This concept then underlies Gadamer\u2019s thoughts on the idea of the fusion of horizon. This idea indicates that understanding religious texts must be done by bringing together the text\u2019s horizon, author and reader to reach a meaningful knowledge in interpreting a text. Suppose this view applies in understanding religious language related to the COVID-19 pandemic protocol. In that case, interpreter must consider all dimensions associated with the social situation to find a substantive meaning and a complete understanding of all dimensions related to the interpreter\u2019s current position to apply the substantive meaning contextually in actual cases.",

The analysis of this undergraduate thesis focuses on hermeneutical reading of the text. This study aims to find out critique of ideology concept by reading both the text and the researcher (as interpreter) horizons to get a current meaning of the text. This study applies philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Jurgen Habermas\u2019s critical theory to analyze the novel. After interprets the horizon of the text with three stages of analysis (understanding, historical consciousness, and history of effect), then the prejudice/presupposition (Habermas\u2019 critique of ideology) appear dialectically as interpreter horizon to read the 1984 in its current context. The result proves that, although the work of structure of power in Orwell's life and interpreter are different - Orwell who live in the tension of world ideologies (with fascism, soviet communism, and other totalitarian power) and interpreter in the late-capitalism era (with liberal consensus domination), but analysis of critique of ideology in the 1984 novel in the current context relates to several things. Among other things are, total domination of the system like distorting symbolic interactions and how power works supported - manifested in high-level technology with its propaganda and supervision of civil society. At this point, to resist against totalitarian system, both Orwell and Habermas are similar as well - a process of rationalization with a communication paradigm with emancipatory mission to give a progressive free individual formation in the society.",

In the course of the discussion, I emphasize many fine details of Gadamer\u2019s approach to Cartesianism. I further ask whether Gadamer really succeeds in disentangling himself from a methodical demand that is fundamental for Descartes but that he also underscores in the works of other philosophers, such as Hegel and Heidegger. I suggest that Cartesianism thus appears enlightening to point out the complexities of Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: This study addresses the patriarchal bias prevalent in traditional Qur\u2019anic exegesis, which often privileges male perspectives and neglects women\u2019s experiences. Such interpretations can lead to gender injustices justified by certain verses. The primary objective is to explore Amina Wadud\u2019s holistic hermeneutic approach, which aims to affirm gender equality in Qur\u2019anic interpretation. Methodology: Employing a qualitative literature-based approach, this research integrates thematic (maudu\u2019i) exegesis, philological analysis, and a women\u2019s perspective. Additionally, the study draws on Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic concepts of prejudice, fusion of horizons, and dialogue, thereby enriching a holistic framework for Qur\u2019anic interpretation.\nMain Findings: The findings indicate that the Qur\u2019an fundamentally supports gender equality. Both men and women share equal rights, obligations, and potentials\u2014whether in worship, social roles, or broader achievements. When examined holistically, verses addressing inheritance, human origins, and gender relations emphasize justice and balance rather than legitimizing any form of gender dominance. Contributions: This research contributes by proposing a more responsive interpretive method that engages contemporary issues of gender equality. The holistic hermeneutic approach encourages re-examining verses often misunderstood in traditional commentary. Consequently, it provides a valuable resource for Islamic education, social policy, and women\u2019s empowerment initiatives. Conclusion: This study concludes that the Qur\u2019an does not endorse patriarchy or matriarchy but rather underscores justice and equality. While the findings remain mostly theoretical, this approach opens avenues for further research on policy implementation and inclusive, gender-just education systems.",

      "abstract": "As long as humans always try to understand the deepest meaning of a text, symbol, or event, hermeneutics is a common activity. However, the gap between the creation\u00a0of texts, symbols or events has created its own problems that must be solved. The problem is,\u00a0should an attempt at interpretation of a text, symbol or event achieve its objective status in\u00a0the sense intended by the author or writer, or not? Hermeneutic thinkers differ in solving\u00a0this problem. Unlike Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm Dilthey who emphasized the importance of revealing the author\u2019s original intent, Hans-Georg Gadamer emphasized the importance of the subjective dimension of the interpreter. In Gadamer\u2019s thought,\u00a0prejudice and cultural influences in interpreting a text, symbol or phenomenon are also\u00a0considered as one of the horizons. Dialectic and horizon fusion in itself will be an internal mechanism to reduce the dominance of prejudice or subjectivity that cannot be accounted for. By paying close attention to Jurgen Habermas\u2019s note that hermeneutics overemphasize\u00a0the aspects of prejudice and cultural influences will only provide opportunities for certain\u00a0communication distortions and cultural hegemony, Gadamer\u2019s contribution can still be maintained as a human hermeneutical activity.",

The philosophical significance of a \u201csensus communis\u201d (common sense) begins with Aristotle, who offered scattered reflections. The topic was taken up in earnest in Enlightenment thought and in German idealism, but it became more of an individual faculty, lacking the deep sense of community and tradition found in earlier formulations. In this paper, the author demonstrates Gadamer\u2019s debt to Pietist thought, examining his appropriation and use of the theology of Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (1702\u20131782), a leading figure in Swabian Pietism, whose ideas had a significant impact in theological circles and broader cultural life. Gadamer\u2019s critique of the Enlightenment\u2019s \u2018prejudice against prejudice,\u2019 owes a debt to the Pietist conception of the sensus communis and his practical philosophy to Pietism\u2019s emphasis on \u2018application\u2019 as a fundamental aspect of a hermeneutical triad.",

The intersubjective cross-examination found in Plato\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dialogue shows that the real meaning comes from the real encounters between speakers; or in Gadamer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term: encounters between text and the reader. For Gadamer, it is always important in this pursuit of meaning and truth that we examine our own prejudice. Cross-examining our own claim of truth and belief is an essential element in Gadamer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hermeneutics. I argue that we can see how the Platonic model of dialogue is easily aligned with the Gadamerian positive approach towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctraditions.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 There is a constant dialogue at work in interpretation, a dialogue between the past and the present, between different traditions and points of view. Dialogue is an important keyword for both Plato and Gadamer in their efforts to their existential quest of wisdom.",

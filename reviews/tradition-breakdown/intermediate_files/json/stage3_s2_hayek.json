      "abstract": "Libertarianism itself does not hold a stance on moral issues and hence does not prevent libertarians from adopting culturally conservative or liberal positions. Though libertarianism has no position on cultural issues per se, this article argues that libertarians should intellectually oppose the ideas behind some of the current cultural developments in the West due to their constructivist nature. Based on Hayek\u2019s critique of constructivism, I contend that many of the recent cultural shifts in society are influenced by rational constructivist ideas\u2014namely, critical theory and deconstruction. These ideas pose an intellectual threat to libertarianism for two reasons: (1) They intellectually challenge the traditional libertarian view of the spontaneous origins of civil society, which they aim to reshape in favor of a structure that reflects a specific postmodern world view. (2) It remains uncertain how a libertarian society would function under a newly constructed social order that does not value free speech, property rights, and other fundamental principles of the current liberal order. The spontaneous order is the defining feature of libertarian social analysis, and it must be intellectually defended.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Spontaneous order literature (\u201cTradition of Spontaneous Order\u201d (1982) by Norman Barry; The Scottish Enlightenment and the Theory of Spontaneous Order (1987) by Ronald Hamowy; \"Spontaneous Order\" (1989) by Robert Sugden; \"The Theory of Spontaneous Order and Cultural Evolution in the Social Theory of F.A. Hayek\" (1990) by Peter J. Boettke; Calculation and Coordination: Essays on Socialism and Transitional Political Economy (2001) by Peter J. Boettke; Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment (2001) by Christina Petsoulas; \"The Origin and Scope of Hayek\u2019s Idea of Spontaneous Order\" (2007) by Louis Hunt; \"Spontaneous Order\" (2015) by Daniel J. D'Amico; \"Spontaneous Economic Order\" (2016) by Yong Tao) has long downplayed the ideas of Michael Polanyi. When attempts were being made to change this attitude (\"Polanyi on Liberal Neutrality\" (1996/97) by C. P. Goodman; \"Michael Polanyi and Spontaneous Order, 1941-1951\" (1997) by Struan Jacobs), they mostly suggested to replace Hayek with Polanyi as the key figure who recoined the concept for the twentieth century. Not surprisingly, scholars of Austrian economics jumped into the arena of competing priority claims (\"Against Polanyi-Centrism: Hayek and the Re-Emergence of \u201cSpontaneous Order\u201d\" (2005) by John P. Bladel) and claimed that Hayek, von Mises and R\u00f6pke have argued for such an order long before Polanyi\u2019s first writing using this terminology was published in 1948. Only a few accounts attempted to present some kind of balance in this respect (Adam Smith's Political Philosophy: The Invisible Hand and Spontaneous Order (2006) by Craig Smith; The Collected Works of F.A. Hayek, Volume 15: The Market and Other Orders (2014) by Bruce Caldwell; \"Friedrich Hayek and Michael Polanyi in Correspondence\" (2016) by Struan Jacobs and Phil Mullins; The Architecture of Neoliberalism: How Contemporary Architecture Became an Instrument of Control and Compliance (2016) by Douglas Spencer; \"Editorial Introduction to \u2018Collectivist Planning\u2019 by Michael Polanyi (1940)\" (2019) by Geoffrey M. Hodgson). This paper aims to explore the so far untold characteristics of Polanyi\u2019s spontaneous order theory through analysing archival materials and doing so offers a reason for reconsidering what we have to know about the history of spontaneous order theory. And this reconsideration might lead to developing new, more fine-grained and viable theories of spontaneous order, including those that can treat claims of spontaneous order and claims of social justice not as incompatible but as compatible aims in ordering social affairs. This perspective should, no doubt, come in handy in our increasingly polarized societies at the beginning of the twenty-first century.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the text \u201cThe Principles of a Liberal Social Order\u201d, Friedrich A. von Hayek quotes from Chapter 57 of the Daoist classic L\u01ceoz\u01d0 \u8001\u5b50 (alternative transliterations are Lao Tzu, Laotse, etc.; the text is also known under the title D\u00e0od\u00e9j\u012bng or Tao Te King \u9053\u5fb7\u7d93). Appearing in a text devoted primarily to the concept of \u201cspontaneous order\u201d, the quote opens up questions regarding the relationship between liberalism and Daoism, which I address in this essay. The discussion comprises three parts. In the first part, I turn to the translation cited by Hayek and, by way of a commentary to the translation, I attempt to gain access to the motifs of \u201ceffortless action/without doing\u201d (w\u00faw\u00e9i \u7121\u70ba), \u201cself-transformation\u201d (z\u00echu\u00e0 \u81ea\u5316) and \u201cself-government\u201d (z\u00eczh\u00ec \u81ea\u6cbb); the second part offers a hermeneutic commentary through which I discuss interpretative approaches found in the Chinese commentarial tradition; finally, the third part outlines transcultural correspondences which explore the political meaning of the Daoist \u201cwithout doing\u201d and the idea of \u201cspontaneous order\u201d in the context of the discursive struggle between the \u201cdemocratic West\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian China\u201d.",

      "abstract": "The article examines the issue of the relation between the idea of a social contract and the constitution. It is argued that the constitution is a formalization of the social contract adopted in society. The interrelation of philosophical ideas of good and justice with the ideas of constitutionalism is considered. In the context of international legal order, the ideas of constitutionalism, good and justice is revealed in the context of international space law. The main example for this is the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.Modern challenges to the international legal order and international law, which are connected with the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, lead not only to rethinking the concept of collective security but also to the restructuring of national legal orders, which were the result of a social contract in each a separate state. Moreover, acquisition by states in the 17th-century subjectivity led to their creation of a regional, and then in the 20th century. - international legal order. In a certain sense, the legal order created and agreed upon by them is a certain social contract, the subjects of which, in contrast to the classical understanding of the concept of a social contract, are states, not people. Therefore, Russian aggression against Ukraine, both existentially and in international legal terms, should be considered as an attempt by the aggressor state in an uncivilized way to revise or even break the social contract \"agreed upon\" by the states.Against this background, the formation of a new legal culture (especially for Ukrainian society) requires the state, society, and every individual to rethink the system of values and those life-leading ideals that guided these subjects in their actions, to achieve what they built their strategies. As Friedrich Hayek noted, for the formation of a common order, it is necessary that in known situations everyone follows certain rules, that is, that everyone's actions do not go beyond a certain range of behavior. Therefore, both for social theory and for social policy, the question of what properties the rules should have so that individual actions of individuals generate a general order is of crucial importance. Some of these rules will be obeyed by all members of society due to the same understanding of the requirements of the situation. Others will follow spontaneously because they are part of their general cultural tradition. But there will be such rules that will have to be imposed, because although it will be profitable for everyone to ignore them, the general order, on which the success of actions depends, will arise only if these rules are followed.",

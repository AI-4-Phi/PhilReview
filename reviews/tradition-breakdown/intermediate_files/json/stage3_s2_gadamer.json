      "abstract": "This paper examines two competing approaches to the study of addiction: the neuroscientific model which conceives of addiction as a brain disease, and the phenomenological critique of neuroscience, which appeals to lived experience. I employ Gadamer\u2019s rich hermeneutic contribution to the phenomenological tradition in order to generate more fruitful dialogue between these competing models. Gadamer\u2019s critique of the leveling of language in science is employed to counter neuroscientific claims to objectivity, while his redescription of the constructive role of prejudice in understanding is employed to highlight inadequacies in the phenomenological critique of neuroscience. Ultimately, I propose a fusion of these contested horizons which can generate richer clinical practice\u2014reimagining the role of addiction recovery as helping individuals interpret and understand their experience of addiction toward new ways of being in the world.",

      "abstract": "German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer is best known for his contribution to the development of philosophical hermeneutics, an interpretive approach to knowledge, understanding and meaning-making. It has become a well-established research approach in the health sciences to shed light on the lived experiences of people living with challenging chronic health conditions. Some feminist scholars have gravitated to Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics for its steadfast rejection of positivism and its intention to uncover preunderstandings and prejudices. However, others have critiqued the approach for its lack of focus on prescribing action for social change and its reluctance to evaluate the prejudices present in its own tradition. In this paper, the authors will demonstrate how using feminist hermeneutics can help health researchers deepen their understanding of illness narratives by examining the power structures contributing to the marginalization of chronically ill people within and outside the healthcare system. They will juxtapose a reflexive investigation of the first author\u2019s experiences with a focused literature review of the dialogue between hermeneutics and feminism. By examining the first author\u2019s experiences with Gadamerian hermeneutics and feminist hermeneutics through self-study, she can in turn unearth her own preunderstandings. This approach will allow the authors to leverage the depth of interpretive understanding generated by hermeneutics while exploring the power structures involved in the complex process that is patient care, particularly that of people with chronic illness. They conclude that this combined approach of feminist hermeneutics allows health researchers to deepen their understanding of illness narratives with issue-specific and effective recommendations to clinicians and public health officials, leading to better-adapted services through a more just approach to chronically ill people.",

      "abstract": "A foundation stone of Hans Georg Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics is the notion of the sensus communis. The philosophical significance of a \u201csensus communis\u201d (common sense) begins with Aristotle, who offered scattered reflections. The topic was taken up in earnest in Enlightenment thought and in German idealism, but it became more of an individual faculty, lacking the deep sense of community and tradition found in earlier formulations. In this paper, the author demonstrates Gadamer\u2019s debt to Pietist thought, examining his appropriation and use of the theology of Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (1702\u20131782), a leading figure in Swabian Pietism, whose ideas had a significant impact in theological circles and broader cultural life. Gadamer\u2019s critique of the Enlightenment\u2019s \u2018prejudice against prejudice,\u2019 owes a debt to the Pietist conception of the sensus communis and his practical philosophy to Pietism\u2019s emphasis on \u2018application\u2019 as a fundamental aspect of a hermeneutical triad.",

I shall draw intellectual insights from Quine's \u2018ontological commitment\u2019, Habermas's \u2018ontological presupposition\u2019, Xu Changfu's \u2018theory of heterogeneity\u2019, Husserl's \u2018ontology layers\u2019, Gadamer's hermeneutic notions \u2018prejudice\u2019 and \u2018tradition\u2019, as well as \u2018ontology building\u2019 practice across the natural and social sciences.

      "abstract": "In Truth and Method, Hans-Georg Gadamer argues that since \"all understanding inevitably involves some prejudice,\" modern historicism suffers from a fundamental hermeneutic blindness: \"historicism, despite its critique of rationalism and of natural law philosophy, is based on the modern Enlightenment and unwittingly shares its prejudices. And there is one prejudice of the Enlightenment that defines its essence:... the prejudice against preju dice itself, which denies tradition its power.\"1 Gadamer s critique alludes to the Enlightenment attack on prejudice, defined as an automatic prejudgment based on customary or habitual patterns of thinking. For Gadamer, such \"provisional\" judgments (273) are fundamental, as they inevitably involve the Heideggerian \"fore-conception\" [Vorgriff], or the interpretive expectations that we bring to a text or experience.2 By implementing an Enlightenment critique of prejudice to foreground the constructed and changing status of human knowledge, modern historicism attempts to evade both the effects of what we know in advance of each interpretive act and the historical status of our \"anticipatory ideas\" (272), thus paradoxically exhibiting its own anti historicist predisposition. Gadamer's German term Vorurteil lends itself to his attack on Enlightenment historicism because, as Gerhard Joseph points out, \"the term means both 'prejudgment' and prejudice'\" as negative bias, and has commonly been translated both ways since the eighteenth century.3 In English, however, these alternative meanings of prejudice coexist less comfortably because the Enlightenment philosophical connotation has fallen into abeyance.4 Gadamer's critique of modern historicism draws our attention to a set of tensions within the concept of prejudice that, in turn, help us to align the history of the novel and the history of human rights in new ways.

      "abstract": "Summary The recovery of the prejudice as well as of the authority and tradition that Gadamer accomplishes is made with the following goal: to point out the function of the dialogue, which has a main role in the legitimation and acceptance of the tradition. The philosopher introduces the dialogue conditions between tradition and the present time, all together with their prejudices and the mutual influences of the several horizons. Also, he includes the privileged condition granted by the distance of time. Gadamer wants to make possible to each and everyone to have what he calls Wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein, especially those who investigate history. We cannot consider history as an object that accepts submissively a complete investigation as well as a definitive analysis. Gadamer try to alert us for the danger that is inserted on the lack of our dialogue capability, which will maintain veiled precisely the kind of knowledge that we most want and need to know. The faith and the search for an objective and absolute knowledge or an absolutely objective knowledge is a mistake and an ingenuousness. This systematic failure cost us the lack of a closer understanding of the historical truth and it disables us of reaching the authentic Wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein.",

Its relevance is justified because it is a structured alternative for conducting bibliographic research within the scope of the Person Centered Approach (PCA). For this, we initially want to justify an epistemological choice of gadamerian hermeneutics in its relation to the research objective. Then, we present the conceptual network formed by the articulation of prejudice, language, tradition, update and fusion of horizons that supports this perspective, in a ways that allows, later, to systematize the phases of information investigation, comprehensive analysis and hermeneutic synthesis to the development of research on the proposed problem. The article ends with the observation of the potentiality and proficiency related to the approximation, and consequent articulation, between PCA and the Gadamerian philosophical perspective, with reflections on the implications regarding the use of a hermeneutic-philosophical method in the production of knowledge in the approach.

Drawing on Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic concepts of tradition, authority, and prejudice, this research reveals how hermeneutic space is created in dialogue, deliberations, and collaborative work. This more fluid understanding for the governance process has key ramifications for public administration research and practice in terms of an ontological understanding of governance, rethinking of the practice of administrative skills, and shifting the manner in which authority is understood and exercised.",

It then discusses the place of tradition in Chinese thought, taking into account the work of Francois Jullien. Finally, the paper addresses the interrelation of experience, past, and tradition, as articulated in Chinese literature, and concludes with a reflection on the contrast between the prescriptive model of Western tradition and Oriental thought.",

Leaving aside differences between Gadamer and his critics, it is argued that his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority and tradition as well as his notions of the fusion of horizons and intersubjective dialogue put into question the utility of dichotomous categories like subjective-objective, normative-descriptive, and insider-outsider in approaches to religion. It is suggested, therefore, that a clearer distinction between theology and religious studies can be established in terms of the subject matter of these disciplines rather than on the basis of their methodological principles. However, as both disciplines venture to understand at least some overlapping dimensions of religious phenomena which make up their common subject matter, to this extent, they can be viewed as dialogical partners and as providing different but complementary perspectives on religion.",

The starting point is constructed using the coordinates proposed by Heidegger (sights, gaze direction and horizon of staff) and prejudice that underlie the contemporary educational tradition. The analysis projects to identify the structure and the horizon of the pedagogical question confronting the contributions of Heidegger, Gadamer and Freire in the development of pedagogy of the question. The structure of the question includes the position in question, as asked and questioned, making it possible construct one horizon to understand the pedagogical question from the student with knowledge from a liberating praxis. We conclude that the structure and the horizon of educational questions are based on the specific logic of the hermeneutic work, where the opening of student experiences and experiences reveals the construction of knowledge through the art of thinking that derives from the transformative praxis.",

      "abstract": "Nothing appears more ancient, and linked to an immemorial past, than the pageantry which surrounds British monarchy in its public ceremonial manifestations. Yet, as a chapter in this book establishes, in its modern form it is the product of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \u2018Traditions\u2019 which appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented. Anyone familiar with the colleges of ancient British universities will be able to think of the institution of such \u2018traditions\u2019 on a local scale, though some \u2013 like the annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge on Christmas Eve \u2013 may become generalized through the modern mass medium of radio. This observation formed the starting-point of a conference organized by the historical journal Past & Present, which in turn forms the basis of the present book.",

After a theoretical overview it suggests that the narrative approach explains the way leaders operate in practice. It argues that with a narrative approach one sees that history is used by business leaders in four different ways: as a source to create traditions and symbols as means of communication, as a way to understand and strengthen the identity of the organisation, as means to create corporate memory and as a tool to connect past, present and future. The examples are taken from a Dutch oral history project on management behaviour at multinationals.",

Through a combination of computer\u2010assisted close reading and contextual analysis of the first movement, this article traces the competing stylistic and ideological directions of early performances \u2013 one deriving from the pre\u2010war tradition of the Schoenberg circle, the other from the European avant\u2010garde associated with Darmstadt and Die Reihe \u2013 and the processes of negotiation through which a more or less consensus interpretation emerged around the end of the 1960s. My aims are to explore ways in which empirical approaches can be deployed for musicological purposes, to relate recorded performances to their historical contexts and to link the story of Op. 27 to the development of music\u2010theoretical approaches that see performance as a function of compositional structure. Key recordings on which the article is based are presented online as Sonic Visualiser session files coordinated with the text.",

      "abstract": "The Kingdom of Bhutan has attracted international attention for adopting \"Gross National Happiness\" (GNH) as its national development policy. The central notion is that gross national happiness is more important than gross national product; the four pillars of GNH are sustainable economic development, good governance, preservation of the natural environment and preservation of the national culture. This paper traces the historical origins of the concept of Gross National Happiness and finds that GNH is newer than the literature and the propaganda usually suggest. Close study of GNH's origins and salience over several decades reveals evidence of the invention of a tradition, in Hobsbawm and Ranger's terms [Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger (Eds.), The Invention of Tradition. Cambridge: CUP, 1983]. The meteoric rise over the last 15 years of GNH as Bhutan's official ideology is a key part of the Bhutanese state's efforts at nation building in the context of rapid and disruptive social and economic change in a highly plural society.",

Contrary to popular knowledge of tea drinking as an ancient Chinese tradition, tea drinking in Quanzhou today is actually a re-invented tradition. The article shows that the popularity of tea drinking in Quanzhou today came about as a result of promotion by various agents involving tea farmers, tea merchants, and the government in post-Mao China. In addition, Taiwanese tea industry and businesspeople also play important roles in the production and modernization of Anxi tea. The re-invented tradition of tea consumption provides a new way of consuming tea and conducting social relations. The culture of tea consumption in Quanzhou today is shaped by both the forces of post-reform economic development and changing perception of social status and modernity.",

However, a closer analysis of tree ordination demonstrates that it is not primarily about Buddhist teaching, but rather is an invented tradition based on the sanctity of Thai Buddhist symbols as well as those of spirit worship and the monarchy. Tree ordinations performed by non-Buddhist minorities in Thailand do not demonstrate a religious commitment but rather a political one.",

It has then evolved into an entertainment arena for singles to show talent, discuss, and interact with one another. The evolution of the shows not only reflects the changing preference of television viewers but also testifies the broader changes of social and gender relations, media regulations, as well as the different values and identities across generations. By examining the invention and reinvention processes of China\u2019s television dating shows, the article argues that dating shows played a significant role in advancing traditional marriage matchmaking culture through (re)invention of new traditions. In doing so, it has not only created new television genres but also mobilized the audience to discuss love and marriage and to voice their opinions on a rapidly changing society.",

They were also the time of the European rush into Africa. There were many and complex connections between the two processes. The concept of Empire was central to the process of inventing tradition within Europe itself, but the African empires came so late in the day that they demonstrate the effects rather than the causes of European invented tradition. Deployed in Africa, however, the new traditions took on a peculiar character, distinguishing them from both their European and Asian Imperial forms.",

This article instead demonstrates a more complex relationship between the two, suggesting that broadcast comedy is an \u2018invented tradition\u2019 (Hobsbawm and Ranger, 1983), which has been one of the most powerful ways for nations to define themselves \u2014 often at the expense of the complexities and contradictions within any one nation-state. Drawing on the idea that nations are \u2018imagined communities\u2019 (Anderson, 1983), this article takes the BBC as a case study, exploring the ways in which an understanding of the \u2018British sense of humour\u2019 has evolved in response to the needs of the nation. In doing so, it explores historically significant moments such as World War II, as well as a range of regional comedy that doesn't make it into national broadcasting circuits. In addition, the notion of \u2018Britishness\u2019 that is sold abroad via such programming is examined. In doing so, this article outlines the ways in which ideas of comedy and the nation intertwine, as well as exploring the problems this relationship might cause for alternative or oppositional ideas of the nation.",

Up to that point in time, many national governments, scientists and industrialists had favoured the rival concepts of heavy-water and graphite-moderated plants. The article focuses on Sweden and West Germany, where central actors only reluctantly gave up their support for domestically developed heavy-water solutions. Studying new archival material and adopting Hobsbawm and Ranger's concept of the 'invention of tradition', the authors analyze how contemporary actors mobilized both the nation and the past when arguing for plants using natural uranium and heavy water. The paper documents how autarkic arguments were superseded by nostalgic sentiments, and how-subsequently-historians have come to perpetuate apologetic parables like 'Swedish line' and 'tradition', respectively.",

Ranger (Eds.), The invention of tradition (pp. 1\u201314). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press] as a long-term process has contributed to Indigenous students experiencing physical education (PE) within Eurocentric curricula that largely ignores their own culture. The study was undertaken at three high schools within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) which come under the remit of the ACT Education and Training Directorate. Documentary evidence was the main data source and figurational sociology was used to inform the study and analyse the data. Central to figurational sociology is the notion of the figuration which refers to how individuals are located interdependently in social structures characterised by relationships of power. Historical and contemporary documents were analysed using content and thematic analysis according to the premise that the document writers are themselves included in figurations and their inclusion or presence has to be taken into account [Dolan, P. (2009), Using documents: A figurational approach. In J. Hogan, P. Dolan, & P. Donnelly (Eds.), Approaches to qualitative research: Theory and its practical application (pp. 185\u2013208). Cork: Oak Trees Press]. The paper identifies key events and long-term processes mainly linked to Australia's colonial past that have shaped contemporary PE curricula. Despite intent within historical PE curricula to include Indigenous perspectives in PE these have largely not translated to actual teaching. The final part of the paper suggests additional research to find ways to embed these perspectives. This is important because current curriculum requirements at a national level emphasise these perspectives.",

By presenting the origin and background of the phenomenon, authors demonstrate that the New Martyrdom is a kind of invented tradition. They focus on analysis of the tension that occurs when history becomes religion by highlighting some problematic issues with regard to the New Martyrdom and showing how the Russian Orthodox Church is addressing them. The analysis sheds new light on the political use of religion for the creation of narrative about the past in contemporary Russia.",

      "abstract": "What makes workers work better: social or financial incentives? This important management research question has a long and contested history, with most studies emphasizing the former. Almost all research into this question draws on the Hawthorne studies conducted by Elton Mayo and colleagues in the interwar United States, with the Hawthorne studies even playing a part in the foundation of the Tavistock Institute and its journal Human Relations in 1947. As this article reveals, the allegedly-unique nature of the Hawthorne studies is an invented tradition deeply embedded in the human relations field to this day. To explode this invented tradition, this article uses previously unstudied historical sources to recover and examine the long-forgotten Incentives and Contentment (1938) studies, conducted from 1929 onwards by sociologist Clarence Northcott at the Rowntree Cocoa Works in York, UK. In contrast to the Hawthorne studies, the Rowntree management research found that financial incentives were more important than social incentives. This article then charts how fashions in work incentives, the importance of personalities and networks, the relatively weak position of sociology in postwar Britain, and the prestige of American expertise, combined in 1947 to ensure the Tavistock\u2019s founders believed the Hawthorne studies were unique.",

      "abstract": "In the recent past, processes of urbanisation related to gentrification have been observed in some rural areas. This article analyses the role of the rehabilitation of vernacular architecture and mainly addresses social groups with high levels of income in the territorial dynamics of the Empordanet in Catalonia (Spain). This case is particularly relevant for two reasons. On the one hand, the Empordanet is under particularly intense and socially selective pressure because of its proximity to Barcelona. On the other hand, this demand for housing is partially related to the reclamation of a kind of tradition associated with a component of strong regional identity. This article explores the various ways in which tradition is reclaimed, recovered, and reinvented, insisting particularly on agents\u2019 behaviours framed in the broader context of governmentality. This is done through a pluralistic research methodology based on the dialogue between architecture and the social sciences. One of its main conclusions is that the rehabilitation of vernacular rural buildings generates a type of housing completely different from traditional constructions in its conception, functionality, design, materials, and construction processes. Furthermore, rehabilitation is closely associated with the generation of a new form of tradition.",

Essays on Marius Barbeau and Sol Tax present figures who were centrally located in anthropologies of their day but who are not currently well remembered. A final essay analyses notions of the canon and considers place of a classic ethnographic area, highland New Guinea, in anthropological canon-formation. The essays illustrate different processes of inclusion and exclusion in history of anthropology. Taken together, their aim is to suggest a larger project of historical recuperation that contemporary anthropologists should find increasingly relevant to both their theoretical and their political concerns.",

Soon after the final legal victory in 1887, the champagne industry initiated a branding and marketing campaign to change champagne's image from a wine of new money and new immorality into that of a wine sanctified by Dom P\u00e9rignon and produced from an almost paradisiacal terroir. For visitors to the Paris 'Expositions' of 1889 and 1900, the Epernay journalist Raphael Bonnedame wrote a paean to his native district. Quelques mots sur le Vin de Champagne mythologised the wine as embodying the inspirational spirit of a utopian district characterised by beauty, wit and elegance and revitalised the myth of Dom P\u00e9rignon. His work laid the foundations for the cultural terroir that still underpins champagne's brand image. This was the first territorial brand of the modern era and while the fundamental marketing strategies of modern champagne were created in London in the mid-nineteenth century, the brand image showcased by the websites of today was inspired by a journalist of genius in the late nineteenth century.",

When T \u00fcrkmenistan became independent in 1991 its first president, S aparmyrat N y\u00fdazow, promoted himself as the \u2018savior\u2019 of the nation by reconceptualising what it meant to be T \u00fcrkmen. Myth, public texts and language policy were used to construct this identity. While they were the targets of the state's cultural products, T \u00fcrkmen citizens contributed to the processes of cultural production. N y\u00fdazow legitimised his authoritarian leadership, first by co\u2010opting T \u00fcrkmen citizens to support his regime, and then by coercing them as participants in his personality cult. The paper concludes that N y\u00fdazow used the production of culture, \u2018invented tradition\u2019 in Hobsbawm's sense, to bolster his agenda and further his own power. It also argues that the exaggerated cult of personality Ny\u00fdazow cultivated limited his achievements, rather than solidifying them.",

In the last decade alone, he has been the subject of at least three films, two mUlti-episode TV dramas and a documentary film, in addition to numerous books and websites, which have involved large numbers of Qin Shihuang enthusiasts in the Chinese diaspora as well as some of China's most prominent writers, filmmakers, directors and actors. Zhang Yimou' s Hero stands out from this genre not only because it was the most expensive Chinese blockbuster before Chen Kaige' s The Promize (Wu ji, 2005) and China's No.1 boxoffice success, but also because it has been one of the most controversial films in recent years (Guo, 2003).",

      "abstract": "The Wimbledon Championships, staged annually at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), is a British sporting event of great social significance. Its popularity stretches beyond the high standards of tennis on display to what it seems to represent culturally for many people. Wimbledon\u2019s public image has been carefully constructed over the years, with consideration given to how the players look, behave, and play; the appearance of the courts and AELTC grounds; the refreshments; its corporate partners; and its relationship to television and media generally. This study suggests that many of these aspects, including Wimbledon\u2019s fashions and the all-whites clothing rule, the grass courts, the strawberries and cream and Pimm\u2019s, the royal box, \u201cHenman Hill,\u201c and the eulogizing of Fred Perry, conform to Eric Hobsbawm\u2019s concept of \u201cinvented traditions.\u201d Through analysis of Wimbledon\u2019s subtle branding and constructed public image, as gleaned from testimonies from AELTC executive-committee members and high-profile Wimbledon officials, this article discusses how these invented traditions serve various functions for the AELTC, namely, to establish social cohesion among an \u201cimagined community\u201d of Wimbledon fans, to legitimize Wimbledon\u2019s high status globally, and to inculcate beliefs, value systems, and behavioral conventions in tandem with Wimbledon\u2019s nostalgia for its amateur \u201cgolden age.\u201d",

      "abstract": "The socio-ethnic constitution of the Thessalonian ekklesia is notoriously difficult to pin down, but one consistently argued position is that the group was comprised largely of Gentiles. The only passage that presents a problem for this theory is 1 Thessalonians 2:14\u201316. Rather than focus on philological and theological issues to identify whether this passage is \u201cPauline\u201d or not, this article treats 1 Thessalonians 2:14\u201316 as an \u201cinvented tradition\u201d (\u00e0 la Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger) whic links the social experience of the Thessalonians to the nascent ekklesia in Judaea. Instead of acting as a mouthpiece for Paul's theology concerning Jews, the point of this passage may instead be to invent a coherent \u201cpast\u201d for the Thessalonians, who may have had few other social features in common upon which to base their group identity. By appropriating an \u201calready in place\u201d framework for identity (Deuteronomistic theology) and by connecting the Thessalonians' experience to both the ekklesia in Jerusalem, as well as to past prophets, 1 Thess 2:14\u201316 attaches the Thessalonians to an identity that extends beyond their local group.",

The case method\u2019s popularity dovetails with a conviction that business education is a training in taking action to solve business problems. In recent years, however, following corporate scandals and the Global Financial Crisis, attention has focused on the shortcomings of today\u2019s business school graduates, with the case method seen as contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business. Subsequently, there has emerged a binary dichotomy of those for and those against the case method, with much heated, circular debate but little in the way of progress. By looking deeper into the complexities surrounding the emergence of the case method at Harvard and how the case method could have evolved differently from this point, we can move the debate to a new level: a focus not on the pros and cons of what the case method is, but on what it could be.",

Then we will detail this background that constitutes what we call \u2018the invention of tradition\u2019, and we will pass on to a characterization of current tendencies in the field of youth studies and politics. The second objective is to present through a case study (participation in secondary schools) some discussions regarding the link between youth and politics.

In the history of the institution published in Hortus fluminensis (1894), Rodrigues described a scene in which the regent prince John VI, when solemnly founding the garden in 1809, would have planted an imperial palm with his own hands, a specimen known as palma mater. The period was full of political tension, due to the sudden change of government with the Proclamation of the Republic, on November, 15, 1889. In this article we discuss whether the name of Rodrigues was a consensus for director of the garden. Although he was recognized in Brazil and abroad as an important Brazilian scientist, he was a steadfast Monarchist. In this context, we present a critical analysis of the discourse involving the palma mater. The results suggest this discourse is historically unlikely, leading us to believe it is the case of an \u2018invented tradition\u2019 by the new director, expressed as an allegory with political goal. Other studies are necessary to better understand his goals, his interlocutors and possible reactions provoked by such manifestation.",

Since Louis XVI walked up to the guillotine, we have been used to thinking of a left/right opposition driving political change, but this was not the only division at the time, nor indeed since: during the Terror, Robespierre was supported by the Montagnards, the deputies who sat on the highest benches of the Assembly, while the opposition was located at the bottom, in the Marais or the Plain. Like during la Terreur, today\u2019s politics, from France to the United States, appears more to oppose a centre to an extreme, and this prism allows us to track Skocpol\u2019s own evolution since 1979, from periphery to centre.",

Their synchronous evolution constitutes a crucial thread in the development of human civilization. This paper first traces the historical progression of the synchronous development between scientific revolutions and social structural changes, revealing the correspondence between scientific breakthroughs and transformations in social forms across different historical stages. It then analyzes the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the synchronicity of scientific revolutions and social structural changes from multiple dimensions, elucidating the dynamic relationships between scientific breakthroughs and societal needs, the cycles of scientific development and social transformation, as well as scientific innovation and societal resources. Against the backdrop of the contemporary technological revolution, this study proposes practical pathways to strengthen demand-oriented scientific research planning, improve institutional adaptation support systems, and promote public participation and collaborative mechanisms. These suggestions aim to provide theoretical reference and practical guidance for achieving efficient synchronization and adaptation between technological revolutions and social structures.",

The paper interprets historical data and examines the main arguments within theories of revolutions. The focus is on structural factors and the analysis presented by Theda Skocpol, with an additional emphasis on the role of the proletariat. The basic thesis is that one of the key conditions is the existence of branched networking of the peasant communes and workers' associations, with sufficiently strong connections within the classes. That is, discontent with the economic situation and the weakening of the central government would not in themselves lead to revolutionary events, just as joint activities of the proletariat and the leaders of opposition parties should not be neglected.",

      "abstract": "Collective human activities are the motors of social change. Change depends less on mutual understanding and more on the contradiction between different micro-to-macro-level functioning units. Thus, sociological theories bring together the network of relationship between multiple structures while analyzing the status of continuity or change in society. Insofar as Nepali society has undergone tremendous changes, attempts of inserting more recent sociological theories becomes customary. Notwithstanding this, the application of classical theories in analyzing the change has been a major trend. The 2007-Madhesh Revolt was one of the major turning points in Nepal\u2019s socio-political history, which has brought significant macro-level changes in Nepal. Attempts are made to discuss and theorize the Revolt, but emphasis is given more to the internal structure bypassing the role of a macro-level international structure. This paper is written with reference to a widely acclaimed book \u2018Madhesh Bidrohako Nalibeli\u2019 and examines whether the book has applied the most updated sociological theories of social movement. After reviewing Theda Skocpol\u2019s social structural approach of social movement, it is found that the book is too narrow in theorizing the revolt in a sociological manner. The book has given credit to national-level phenomena than the global capitalist process in shaping the Madhesh Revolt.",

In her important essay with Margaret Somers, she identified three distinct strands of CHA that tackled macro-historical question in distinct but ultimately also complimentary ways. In doing so, she established the foundation for subsequent work on CHA methodology. The article elaborates the subsequent elaborations of Skopol and Somer\u2019s CHA typology and the factors contributing to this evolution. It also underscores how many of those innovations were already implicit in Skocpol\u2019s State and Social Revolutions even though she herself did not highlight it in her own methodological writings. Skocpol the empirical scholar thus turns out to have been methodologically more advanced than Skocpol the methodologist.",

Second, China\u2019s reform model has resulted in a combined and complex institutional structure that effectively integrates the market, the state and political parties in a party-state system. Third, during the rise of China, the market economy, local competition and the authority of political parties have been the source of vitality, the driving force and the stabilizer, respectively.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper offers a critique of the theoretical interpretations of scholars such as Perry Anderson regarding the root causes of the rise of China.\n",

      "abstract": "Through the lens of social movement theory, this paper investigates the drivers of individual users\u2019 social influence on Twitter during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Following this lens, we suggest an extended model of sustained social influence (that considers retweets as the measure of user influence) as a function of the duality of individual Twitter users\u2019 social actions and the underlying facilitating Twitter network structure. Based on an analysis of organic large-scale Twitter data on this social movement, we examine how characteristics of individuals\u2019 social actions, namely activity and tenure on Twitter, and characteristics facilitated by the network (i.e., the number of followers as well as centrality in the community structure of Twitter), impact retweet influence in time windows spanning the movement. Utilizing a mixed methods approach consisting of machine learning and human coding we conceptualize social movement-related engagement activities of Twitter users, which map to generic frames of social movement mobilization. The analysis reveals interesting patterns across different contexts of the Egyptian Revolution. Regarding individual social action, social movement related to \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d activities, as well as tenure, were found to contribute to individual social influence. In terms of the facilitating structure, the follower network (an observed network structure) and centrality (an unobserved network structure) were both found to contribute significantly to sustained influence.",

Yet even though corporations between subjects are regular, articles merely focusing on comparisons of theories in two research fields can be defined as in shortage. As a result, trying to find out similarities and differences between major sociological theories and international relations theories can be a great help and guidance for crossing-major research. From the analysis with a theoretical aspect, this paper tries to show the differences and similarities of two theories from a theoretical basis by adding a brief introduction of a combined new theory from two theories and a table showing the comparison of the two theories; the paper will show a much clearer vision to the differences and similarities. By using the example of situations in the French revolution, those true and existing historical issues with great influences on both French society and European, even international politics and diplomatic atmosphere gave out clear sights about the practical analysis for comparisons between international constructivism and social functionalism. As a result, from both theoretical aspects and practical examples, the paper will conclude that the similarities between the two theories will focus on the interdependent relationship between agencies and structures, and the differences will focus on the appropriate use fields.",

The article seeks to make three main contributions. Firstly, while accepting the critique against the failure of structuralist revolution theory to explain why revolutions can occur under difficult circumstances, the article proposes a structuralist solution instead of the focus on intentions and processes in contemporary revolution theory. Secondly, it brings a new angle to the emerging dialogue between the different fields that theorize social movements and revolutions, by combining Alberto Melucci's early and later approaches to social movements and temporality. Thirdly, the Meluccian approach is utilized in a case study that explores how independence from France can be understood in the Haitian Revolution, which serves to illustrate the strengths of the theoretical approach and to criticize the major accounts of independence in existing studies of the Haitian Revolution. production both in terms of its form and substance in the burning of the plantations and killing of slave \u2010 owners; and (3) provoked a severe and uncompromising response from the slave \u2010 owners (both grands blancs and gens de couleur ), the French administration, and the petits blancs .",

In the history of science, Kuhn 1970 argues in his landmark work that science passes through four phases. In the first phase, scientists operate without a paradigm, and during this period, they experience all sorts of problems. The second phase sees the birth of a paradigm, and scientists begin to operate within it. In the third stage, weaknesses or flaws of the new paradigm begin to emerge. They may be explained away if they are not serious; however, if they prove otherwise, the paradigm is overturned, ushering in the fourth phase (scientific revolution). The successor follows the route followed by the predecessor; thus, the paradigm shift becomes a life cycle. The paper argues that the field of social development commenced with the Dominant Paradigm that, over the years, began to face overwhelming problems that finally overthrew it. It was replaced by the Dependency Paradigm, which suffered the same fate and was ousted by Participatory Development. This Article, a synthesis of recent literature, demonstrates that Kuhn's paradigmatic stages apply to the field of social development. The work proves intriguing and useful to the broad and interdisciplinary field of social science.",

      "abstract": "In neglected communities, waste and organic residues are not only a vector of several problems, like diseases and water pollution, but also a contributor to increasing forms of vulnerability and marginalization. At the same time, these communities also have presented innovative local initiatives and transformative learning about natural resources management that can be a vehicle for achieving more sustainable food systems. In the south of Brazil, community-based organic residue management has shown an extraordinary potential to improve food security and livelihoods for (\u22481600) community members of a vulnerable urban territory. In this context, the overall objective of this article is (a) To better understand what Social Learning (SL) processes related to successful organic residues management in neglected communities exist and (b) To identify what knowledge systems are created in one empirical case. The study case is based on a communitarian waste management project, the Bucket Revolution Project (BRP). The analytical framework builds upon social learning theory and its triple-loop process focusing on four specific phenomena. The applied mixed-methods approach was made in four steps: 1. a focus group to investigate collective community issues; 2. semi-structured interviews to investigate specific and individual issues in the context of the BRP; 3. social media analysis to better understand the BRP narratives; and finally 4. participant observation in community and institutional meetings. Mainly using MaxQda software and coding indicators of SL, the data show that \u201cDiversity of knowledge integration\u201d is the most identified SL indicator in the interviews (52%). For BRP, identity development, community conditions improvement, and environment understanding are three key components of the knowledge system enhanced through an underlying process of social learning. Furthermore, the study also shows that there are endogenous and exogenous social learning processes at work.",

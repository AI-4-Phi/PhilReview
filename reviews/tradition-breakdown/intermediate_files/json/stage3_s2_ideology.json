      "abstract": "Research in the field of pop culture and its semantic fields occupies an important place in cultural science to-day. Elements of pop culture, such as music and cinema, are currently sufficiently represented in scientific dis-course. In this paper, two views on the interpretation of pop culture will be considered, belonging to the Russian traditionalist philosopher Alexander Dugin and the Slovenian social philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. These \u201cpublic philosophers\u201d are known for sometimes extravagant and outrageous statements, their ideological differences are expressed in the form of an interpretation of pop culture and its conclusions. The situation when two well-known modern philosophers with diametrically opposed political and philosophical positions reflect on the na-ture of the introduction of elements of the system into pop culture (the concepts of \u201ctradition\u201d and \u201cideology\u201d), undoubtedly, should be considered through a comparison of interpretations. Dugin\u2019s analysis of pop culture is based on a traditionalist interpretation and, as will be shown in the article, is quite close to hermeneutical theo-ry, namely Heidegger and Gadamer. In turn, \u017di\u017eek\u2019s analysis of pop culture is based on Marxism, the psychoa-nalysis of Jacques Lacan interpreted by the philosopher, and the theory of ideology of Louis Althusser. The primary issue addressed in this article revolves around the consonance of these interpretive approaches. The authors seek to discern the points of convergence (if any) between their respective conceptual frameworks. Through this comparative exploration, the article endeavors to illuminate the complexities inherent in the philo-sophical discourse surrounding pop culture and its ideological implications.",

Overcoming the aggressive mythologies of individualistic liberalism, which have led to a value-based and worldview schism and are contributing to the evolving crisis in Western legal tradition, requires not merely a critical approach (while avoiding the risks of sliding into fanatical negativism) but a constructive, creatively generative approach. This involves identifying and elucidating the distinctive philosophical-ethical foundations of Russian constitutional humanism. Recognizing the scale and nature of the issues under discussion, the authors primarily focus on the ideological aspects of updating the constitutional model of human legal status from the perspective of the identity of domestic constitutionalism. It is argued that, in terms of value-based worldviews and methodology, it is crucial to shift the focus of the discussion around the legal status of the individual towards the foundational principles of ethical-legal obligation, and consequently, towards identifying and systematizing the subjective duties and obligations associated with spiritual-moral imperatives.",

      "abstract": "The article examines classical natural law as the ideological foundation of the legal tradition in the Western world. As the author demonstrates, natural law was inherently linked to the legal traditions of antiquity and the Middle Ages, shaping both the dominant historical type of legal thinking and the models of legal regulation implemented within the respective traditions for the behavior of participants in legal communication. The preeminent position of natural law was determined by historical context as well as the specificities of the legal orders corresponding to that historical type. According to the author, the doctrine of classical natural law has become the ideological bedrock of the Western legal tradition in all its diverse aspects and manifestations. It can, therefore, be asserted that the Western legal tradition, viewed from this perspective, constitutes a collection of legal ideas characteristic of Western civilization and intended for the modernization of non-Western states.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the complex processes of memorialization, reinvention, and forgetting that have characterized the Ordo-liberal tradition; the role of the Freiburg School; the selection of certain aspects of political economy and of certain thinkers and texts; and the distinctive focusing illusions that have followed. It also looks at how its identity has been shaped by its ideological makeup and its model of citizenship. The picture that emerges is of a tradition whose core characteristics can be defined but whose boundaries are difficult to fix. Part of the problem is its ideological hybridity as both conservative and liberal. The chapter looks at the dual nature of the Ordo-liberal tradition as explicit and formalized knowledge and as tacit and common-sense knowledge (William Sorley). In the first sense it is characterized by academic power structures, notably in economics and law, and canonical texts, and by the effects of generational change on these structures. In the second sense, Ordo-liberalism is bound up with administrative cultures and the extent to which they are rule-bound and receptive. The chapter then considers two other aspects of the Ordo-liberal tradition: as ideal type (Eucken) and more loosely as family resemblance (Ludwig Wittgenstein); and as authentic and invented tradition (Eric Hobsbawm), distinguishing Freiburg 1, 2, and 3. Finally, the chapter identifies the Ordo-liberal model of citizenship as based on safeguarding the morally responsible individual: the wise consumer, the thrifty saver, and the responsible creditor. It condemns feckless and profligate behaviour, notably of debtors. This model is subjected to critique.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this research is to uncover the mechanisms through which platform ideology is transformed into a form of total domination, embedded within the very infrastructure of digital capitalism. This paper demonstrates that digital platforms are not merely neutral intermediaries in the realm of communication; rather, they actively constitute new forms of subjectivity. In doing so, they reframe the human being as an object of algorithmic control and a source of user data. The scientific novelty of the study lies in its examination of the phenomenon of platform ideology through the lens of the intellectual tradition of immanent critique, as developed by the leading theorists of the Frankfurt School. This theoretical framework allows us not only to draw parallels between processes of digitalization and the logic of the culture industry but also to identify a radicalization of alienation and reification under the conditions of digital capitalism. The findings affirm the continued relevance of Critical Theory as an indispensable tool for a scientific understanding of digital society. Furthermore, they underscore the necessity of rethinking traditional categories of domination and subordination within the context of platform capitalism.",

To be a successful practical agent, he explains, is to reach for genuine human goods and resist all forms of ideological subjection. And our virtues are the intellectual and moral powers that can help us in this task. Considering which virtues to practise, this book examines the qualities of hope, truthfulness, comradeship, courage, and justice and uncovers how all the virtues are key, in differing ways, to sustaining our practical agency in the face of ideological manipulation.\n Bringing together ethics, social philosophy, and Aristotle via MacIntyre, as well as key thinkers from Gramsci to Rehmann,Revolutionary Aristotelianism and Ideologyprovides an urgent investigation into the necessity and virtues of social struggle.",

      "abstract": "Due to global proliferation and wide accessibility of large language models of artificial intelligence, we are now \"conversing\" with machines. We ask them questions on various topics concerning nature and society, request them to write texts in a specific style for diferent occasions, and receive seemingly coherent responses. We think about these responses, adopt them, apply them, or continue the \"conversation\" with an imagined \"allknowing interlocutor\" whom we refer to as \"he\". In the communication between humans and machines, a new speech act of apparent coherent exchange is developing, which evokes rhetorical contextualization and includes certain implications of intellectual stimulation for humans, but also manipulation over them. This \"he\" with whom we \"converse\" rhetorically represents the ethos of artificial intelligence, which is at the centre of contemporary thought about this technological phenomenon. In this paper, it is observed through a gender lens, using an interdisciplinary analysis of machine statements of the conversational BOT Chat+GPT, applying critical studies of sociolinguistics, rhetoric, and the sociotechnical context. The construction of ethos is examined in relation to its power to possess and transmit knowledge about the gender binary division in historical and contemporary perspectives, and is revealed as ideologically ambivalent and restrictive.",

      "abstract": "The article further elaborates on a project of phenomenological critique of ideology and reveals its potential for the discourse of literature. Since the paradigm of studying ideology as a \u2018false consciousness\u2019 set in classical Marxism run into several problems connected with the transition from being in ideology to performing its critique, a genuine way out of it became impossible due to the totality of a discursive structure common to them. The articulation of this paradox in Karl Mannheim, Louis Althusser, Paul Ric\u0153ur, Michel Pecheux, and Mikel Dufrenne changed the way of statement of the question, shifting the emphasis from the content of ideology and its characteristic features to the status of a critic who is inevitably hypostatizing his thinking. The change of perspective, in turn, entailed a transformation of the method: while the previous tradition focused on finding a connection between the distorted representation of reality in ideological consciousness and the social position of its bearer, structuralist and phenomenological approaches tend to consider the contingent content of consciousness as an inevitable consequence of its structuring always-already-given horizon of meaning. Working with the latter, Mark Richir introduces the concept of a symbolic institution\u2014the domain of meaning, which determines the human habitus, providing it with linguistic and cultural practices that have lost their phenomenological origin. In this framework, the criticism of ideology is understood as an exit from a symbolic institution, albeit temporary. Mark Richir thematizes this exit as an encounter between symbolic and phenomenological registers, i. e. a phenomenological challenge that assumes the agent of the reduction. Nevertheless, gaining a foothold 'outside' the symbolic institution is impossible: the overcome symbolic order undergoes recoding over time. Therefore, the phenomenological criticism of ideology cannot offer a normative program of a presumed non-ideological field to which the previous tradition aspired. The work hypothesizes that such critique is given as a trace of a once-perfect exit from a symbolic institution and is subject to interpretation as evidence. The development of this hypothesis is presented in the final, practical part of the work.",

The authors consider the problem of demarcation of ideology and philosophy, based on subject and motivational differences, and come to the conclusion that the differences between theoretical and practical philosophies are conventional, are the result of the development of academic tradition and are not characteristic of modern philosophy as a praxeological sphere. Using the example of Michel Onfray's work, they show how a modern philosopher can transform an academic study of the history of philosophy into an ideological form. Michel Onfray models his own philosophical lifestyle project as a trench resistance to the capitalist microphysics of power, dehumanizing and alienating man. Philosophizing, transmitted to the masses free of charge, becomes a way of anarchic privatization of everyday life as a space of self-creation of personality and identity by the subject.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the dynamics of values and ideas that shaped Soekarno's syncretic and eclectic thinking. This study uses a historical method that includes four stages, namely heuristics, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. Through comparative analysis, it is shown that there are differences between the concepts of syncretism and eclecticism. Eclecticism is an approach to thinking that selectively combines various elements of thought from different systems of thought. This differs from syncretism, which tends to combine elements of values and thoughts into a unity with traces of contradiction within it. The results of this study show that Soekarno's syncretic thinking was born from an active dialectical process between tradition, values, and philosophy. The intersection of Javanese values, Theosophy, Abangan Islam, and Hinduism became the foundation for the formation of Soekarno's moral horizon, which was oriented towards the idea of unity. Meanwhile, Soekarno's eclecticism was the result of his adaptation of HOS Tjokroaminoto's eclectic style of thinking, as reflected in his writings on Islam and Socialism. Tjokroaminoto selected concepts of socialism that were compatible with the framework of Islam, rather than accepting the doctrine of socialism. Based on this approach, Soekarno formulated syncretic and eclectic ideological ideas in his 1926 writing Nationalism, Islamism, and Marxism. The uniqueness of this study lies in the position of syncretism as Soekarno's moral philosophy and eclecticism as Soekarno's epistemology",

Hasan Hanafi's thoughts, which promote left-wing Islam, present an ideological conflict, especially with traditional interpretations that focus more on aspects of faith and spirituality. This study uses library research because the primary focus of the study is on collecting secondary data through a study of various written literature sources. The study results show that: 1) Hasan Hanafi's Islamic Leftic Concept influences the interpretation of materialism in the Islamic tradition. Hasan Hanafi developed the concept of Islamic Left, which integrates the ideology of materialism with Islamic principles. In his thinking, Islam is not only seen as a spiritual religion, but also as a tool to criticize social and political injustice, and to encourage structural change. 2) The implications of the interpretation of materialism according to Hasan Hanafi in contemporary Islamic thought are that Hanafi's materialist interpretation brings important implications in contemporary Islamic thought by emphasizing that religious texts must be understood in a social and economic context. He argues that Islam must function as a force for social change, not just for individual worship. 3) The problems of Hasan Hanafi's thinking and the interpretation of materialism according to the views of Muslim intellectuals are that Hasan Hanafi's thinking on the interpretation of materialism faces criticism from conservative Muslim intellectuals who consider it a deviation from traditional interpretation.",

      "abstract": "The article provides in-depth the issue of the first literary text, which serves as the foundation for the development of literature as a distinct system apart from the oral tradition. In this context, we aim to revisit the question of which work by A.E. Kulakovsky should be regarded as the inaugural text of Yakut literature: the chronologically first by its conception and composition or the first by publication, which became widely known to readership. The paper forwards a hypothetical proposition of the importance of the publication of A.E. Kulakovsky\u2019s first poem \u201cOath of Abasy\u201d in 1908, which was selected by the author himself from the entire corpus of his early body of work. The purpose of the paper is to analyse the first poem by A.E. Kulakovsky in the aspect of poetics of the literary text itself. The research objectives include the analysis of the poem in the aspect of identifying the \u201cpoetic principle\u201d within and in the context of the formation of the literary text as a whole, which determined the principles of formation of the poet\u2019s literary poetics. The results of the analysis of A.E. Kulakovsky\u2019s first poem demonstrate that it was this exact work, rather than \u201cAlgys to Baianai\u201d, should be seen as the first literary text of the tradition, symbolising the beginning of literature as a new type of text, distinct from folklore. Analysis of this poem confirms that literature, unlike folklore, is aimed from the start at the author\u2019s creation of the poetic principle proper, which permeates the text on all its levels. The scientific justification of \u201cthe primary text\u201d of Yakut literary tradition should be considered as a fully motivated departure from the ideological assessments, characteristic of Soviet literary criticism and, in particular, in the history of studying the literary heritage of A.E. Kulakovsky.",

      "abstract": "The article reveals the relationship between tradition and ostracism as a mechanism of its maintenance and preservation. A sufficiently stable ideological and semantic, sacralised core of tradition always carries a potential possibility of activation of ostracism as a protective reaction of the social system to criticism of tradition or an attempt to change or eliminate it. On the example of the cases of L. N. Tolstoy and A. V. Kuraev* the stages of the emergence and escalation of the conflict of values associated with the opposition between the individual and tradition in the person of religion and the state are analysed. A number of peculiarities of ostracism as a social practice are noted, which will allow not only to compare similar cases, but also to predict their emergence and propose technologies to manage them.",

Through literary devices such as allegory and panegyric, Pope employs tradition not only to question the contemporary political and social landscape but to posit the Stuart dynasty as a symbol of national prosperity and harmony. \nContrastingly, \u201cThe Communist Manifesto\u201d openly challenges the capitalist ideology that Marx and Engels argue perpetuates class struggle and exploitation of the proletariat. The Manifesto calls for a revolutionary overhaul of the social order, drawing on traditions of socialist thought and the historical precedent of class struggle to justify its radical aims. Despite its revolutionary stance, the Manifesto similarly relies on the manipulation of tradition\u2014both embracing and rejecting it\u2014to articulate a vision of communist society. \nBoth texts, therefore, are situated at the intersection of literary expression and ideological conflict, illustrating how tradition can serve as a versatile tool in the articulation of resistance. Whether through the invocation of historical continuity and national identity in \u201cWindsor Forest\u201d or the revolutionary call to arms in \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d tradition is employed to critique existing social and political orders. The abstract underscores the complexity of these texts\u2019 engagement with tradition, highlighting their shared emphasis on the transformative potential of ideological resistance. This comparison illuminates the rich dialogues between literature and politics, demonstrating how textual analysis can reveal deeper insights into the mechanisms of ideological critique and resistance.",

      "abstract": "The tradition of Dravidian ideology encompasses a variety of material and historical implications. None of the literary and artistic activities emerge in isolation, but rather from the folds of history and social upheavals, and history has two sides. Which side we stand on has to do with our mental system and cultural understanding. The 2,000-year-old Tamil tradition has been influenced by various kinds of literature that support the foundations of Dravidian philosophy. Jain Buddhism, which was once very strong in the Tamil community, took materialism to the fore. They classified human beings on the basis of their actions. When we look closely at the lines such as \u2018Ittar Periyor idathor izhikolathor (Those who helped others are great those who ignored others are inferior),\" etc., they did not discriminate on the basis of birth but were defined on the basis of morality. The question of whether the concept of Dravidianism has reached the youth properly in today's time is very important. This is because there is an increasing tendency to project Dravidianism against Tamil nationalism. The Tamil tradition is the rational tradition, and the knowledge tradition of the Siddhas is presented as the Dravidian tradition. Therefore, Dravidianism should be matched with Tamil. The word Dravidian acts as a link to Tamil Nadu. The Dravidian will be the weapon to defeat the conspiracy to alienate the people who have accepted the dignity of the Tamil land. On that basis, this article attempts to link the aesthetic elements of Ki.Ra., which recorded the lives of the Telugu-speaking people, with the Dravidian elements.",

Androcentrism as an initial ideological attitude largely determines both the content of classical philosophical texts and the approaches of researchers to their interpretation. Theoretical analysis. It is noteworthy that androcentrism of \"West\" and \"East\" rests on the same ideological postulates. Their identification is the purpose of this work. The way to identify them is a consistent answer to the question of how, in principle, is androcentrism possible as an ideological position that displaces to the periphery of humanity that part of it that pays the price with its own health, pain, and sometimes even life itself for its physical reproduction? Conclusions. It was revealed that the basis of androcentric ideology is the patriarchal theory of birth postulating the importance of the \u00abseed\u00bb. It is based on the three interrelated postulates, which in terms of content are patriarchal ideas about a woman which are based on the denial of her as an integral and autonomous being. This negation also defines the structure of the \"private\" sphere, thus determining both the worldview of individuals and the structure of society as a whole. This work is recommended for consideration by those researchers who seek to comprehend society as such and patriarchal society as its modern form.",

Previously, such masking of questionable theses under global \u201cprojects\u201d was carelessly ignored, but now it calls for critical analysis, which should serve not only as a reflection of the past but also as a conscious lesson for the future. The object of analysis is L. Bulavka\u2019s publication, which not only actualizes contemporary problems of social, philosophical, and literary anthropology, but also unfolds a series of comparisons, associations, and conclusions. These vividly and convincingly demonstrate the difference in interpretations of totalitarian / anti-totalitarian aspects in the Russian and Ukrainian paradigms of humanities, based on fundamental ontological concepts. The purpose of the article is to prove that Russian humanities has long been an instrument of ideological manipulation: under the guise of established concepts, numerous crimes of the totalitarian government were rehabilitated. To achieve this goal, general scientific methods were used.\n\nThe results of the study demonstrate how manipulative practices of consciousness were tested at the intersection of philosophy, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies in the early 2000s: the boundary between the concepts of good / evil was destroyed, and the essence of the concepts of the Renaissance and Soviet culture was speculatively blurred. By equating them, and putting an equal sign between them, Russian researchers justified the terror of the Soviet government, interpreting anthropocentrism in their own way, without taking into account the mass extermination of people. The refutation of the theses and foundations of the analyzed article by L. Bulavka is based on the works of N. Berdyaev, V. Vernadsky, K. Jaspers, Ukrainian scholars \u2014 P. Yurkevych, M. Shlemkevych, M. Popovych and other contemporary philosophers and psychologists, as well as D. Zatonsky, N. Torkut, N. Shumylo, and others.",

Using a phenomenological approach\u2014combining observation, interviews, and document analysis\u2014the research uncovers how Wahdah Islamiyah navigates the tension between engagement with philosophy and the imperative of religious purification. While previous studies have discussed Wahdah Islamiyah\u2019s roles in law, education, and politics, little attention has been given to its ideological stance on philosophy itself. The findings show that Wahdah Islamiyah does not wholly reject philosophy, but imposes strict boundaries on its study, motivated by the belief that potential harm outweighs possible benefit. Members adopt a selective attitude toward religious texts, and practices deemed as innovation\u2014those lacking clear scriptural basis\u2014are generally avoided. The study argues that Wahdah Islamiyah should be viewed not just through normative or political frameworks, but as an ideological movement negotiating its position within Indonesia\u2019s evolving intellectual landscape. Further research is encouraged to examine other Islamic organizations and the ongoing development of Islamic philosophy in Indonesia.",

However, close examination of his early writings shows that almost all the views he expressed in the 1930s are to be found decades before. Hence, Jabotinsky should be viewed as a thinker who for most of his life held a multifaceted, yet fairly consistent approach to tradition: criticizing Jewish halakha and calling for its reform, while considering religion a great moral force for human progress, describing Jewish tradition as integral to national culture, past and future, and to a certain extent, even romanticizing religious experience. This inclination establishes Jabotinsky as a moderate-secularist easily able to ally himself politically with Religious-Zionists while remaining a non-observant Jew.",

      "abstract": "The article considers the category of alienation in the context of tradition as a philosophical category. The purpose of the article is to analyze sociocultural alienation as a form of destruction of a person\u2019s spiritual being, integrally represented in the form of tradition. The hypothesis is substantiated, according to which the category of tradition as reproduction of spiritual life in the forms of socio-cultural practice of a person is relevant. Alienation can be considered as a result of the rupture of a spiritual/socio-cultural tradition. The conclusion is substantiated that only the development of the socio-cultural tradition and its main spiritual and ideological \u201ccore\u201d allows a person to become a person and consolidate the skills and abilities with which a person can overcome problems in his life, find new, effective forms of interaction with the socio-cultural environment and harmonize his inner world to prevent self-alienation. A living cultural tradition and the connection of generations is the main foundation for a harmonious personal existence. Therefore, the \u201ckey\u201d to solving the problem of alienation is the restoration of the destroyed traditions of human spiritual existence in their specific socio\u2013cultural forms including religion, art, morality and traditional ethics. Currently, this de facto restoration has become the state strategy of Russia, without which its survival in the modern competitive world is impossible. This opens up a new perspective of philosophical and cultural studies of both the forms of existence of tradition in culture and its spiritual and value content.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with theoretical and methodological problem \u2013 the contribution of history of psychology and historical psychology to studying of spiritual/moral sphere of human existence and religious experience. Such knowledge introduces the psychological science to ontology of human psyche, which presupposes its transcendent dimension and \u00abmetaphysical/universal\u00bb foundations. The importance of the Russian philosophical and religious tradition is emphasized. Based on the Orthodox-Christian heritage, in particular, on patristic anthropological and psychological ideas, the description of multilayered inner world of human being is proposed. Such description includes the following \u00ablayers\u00bb around the core \u2013 the \u00abspiritual self\u00bb. Shell-1\u00bb \u2013 reflection of the macro-social world by personality. \u00abShell-2\u00bb \u2013 product of scenario programming in the primary family and immediate environment outside it. \u00abShell-3\u00bb is associated with images of a person\u2019s physical physicality and its pneumo-psycho-somatic connections. \u00abShell-4\u00bb consists of a human being ideas about himself, the world and place in the Universe; it includes a pronounced ideological aspect. The main characteristic of the \u00abshell-5\u00bb is a person\u2019s experience (vague or clear) of some \u00abinvisible spiritual and metaphysical forces of the soul\u00bb presence. \u00abShell-6\u00bb expresses religious/mystical experience of people. The \u00abcore\u00bb of the \u00abshells\u00bb system is integral indivisible human soul associated with the \u00abspiritual self\u00bb. The proposed description of inner world of a personality helps psychological correction, contributes to form a holistic perception of uniqueness of inner world, with its connections with group consciousness of various levels and the Universe. Some research tasks are set for future studying. Particularly correlating the proposed model with ideas about the multilevel structure of inner world of personality in psychological science and human knowledge in general. The importance of correlating the individual \u00ablayers-shells\u00bb system with the multilevelness of collective consciousness is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "As purposefully crafted information around a text, paratext is a critical platform for ideological manipulation in translation. Translators\u2019 comments as a form of paratext can cause ideological deviations between source and target texts that diminish the ideological context of the source text. On this ground, this study aimed to explore translators\u2019 comments and how they can subtly recontextualize the ideology of texts and reframe them in new ideological contexts. Thus, choosing Coleman Barks\u2019 translations of Rumi\u2019s poetry as a case study. It aimed to probe the congruency of Rumi\u2019s ideology with the ideology embedded in the translator\u2019s comments on the verses. The study employed critical discourse analysis as its analytical methodology and explored the collected controversial examples of the translator\u2019s comments. The findings illustrated a high level of ideological deviation between the source and target texts. Moreover, the findings implied the translator\u2019s dominant approach toward a text from an inferior language comparing the superior English language. It has shown that ideological fidelity in translation is not only confined to texts but includes paratexts as well. The present study can be considered significant as it revealed the de-Islamization trend of a Middle Eastern text in the light of the relationship of the unequal languages. The study suggests that paratexts as an empowering platform for translators effectively direct the readers\u2019 perception about the source text and its author. This study hopes to make the translator trainees more cautious in their comments on the original authors\u2019 voices and ideology.",

It does so by questioning the implicit assumptions behind its vision, which promises a world that automatically adapts to our desires before we even know them. These assumptions hinge on a misconception of the value of desire as residing exclusively with its fulfilment, warranting human manipulation for increased predictability. This social trajectory towards algorithmic governance, rather than delivering on the promised fulfilment, undermines our capacity to sustain the same desire that it uses to justify its enterprise.",

Its \u2018peak prometheanism\u2019 arrived in the 1980s, but how far back does the rot go? Some ecological economists locate the wrong turn in the nineteenth century. Before that was physiocracy (meaning \u2018rule of nature\u2019). The physiocrats were the first to call themselves \u2018economists,\u2019 and to formalise political economy as an objective science tasked to anatomise general economic laws. Were they the pioneers of a genuinely \u2018ecological\u2019 tradition of economics? In this essay I subject physiocracy to critical analysis, focussing on agrarian capitalism and laissez-faire economics, as well as class, colonialism, environmentalism and the growth paradigm. I ask whether physiocracy was science masquerading as mysticism or the reverse. Finally, I reflect on the ideology of economics and the limits of \u2018image-focused\u2019 alternatives such as Kate Raworth\u2019s \u2018doughnut economics.\u2019",

      "abstract": "The figure of the Dajj\u0101l has long stood as a compelling yet contested subject within Islamic eschatology. While numerous \u1e25ad\u012bths describe his characteristics and role in the end times, scholars remain divided over whether the Dajj\u0101l should be understood as a literal being or as a symbolic representation of deception and corruption. This study examines a selection of Prophetic traditions concerning the Dajj\u0101l, focusing on their textual meaning and contextual interpretation within Islamic thought. Drawing upon the six canonical collections of \u1e25ad\u012bth (Kutub al-Sittah), the analysis explores both the literal attributes attributed to the Dajj\u0101l\u2014such as his one eye and false claims to divinity\u2014and broader readings that link him to ideological, civilizational, or moral threats in history. The study finds that while classical scholars tended toward literal interpretations, modern Muslim thinkers often adopt a symbolic approach, framing the Dajj\u0101l as a reflection of systemic injustice and spiritual misguidance. Ultimately, the article argues that the Dajj\u0101l tradition, whether interpreted literally or metaphorically, serves as an enduring ethical warning about the dangers of falsehood, the fragility of faith, and the importance of moral discernment in times of trial.",

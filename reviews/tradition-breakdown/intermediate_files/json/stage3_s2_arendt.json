      "abstract": "Following Credit and Faith and Economic Theology, this third volume in the series develops a metaphysics which is missing when trust is ordered around economic theories and institutions. Human existence may be conceived according to its temporal dimensions of appropriation, participation, and offering.\n Engaging with the Western philosophical tradition from the Neo-Pythagoreans and Plato to Heidegger and Arendt, drawing especially from Augustine and Weil, Goodchild offers striking reconstructions of the meanings of economic, political and religious dimensions of life. The outcome is an elaboration of conceptions of wealth, power, contingency, necessity and grace which give a new orientation to human life and endeavour.\n Goodchild situates this discussion within the current historical era of the breakdown of global financial capitalism. He draws from the Financial Revolution in England as a time of crisis which illuminates our own. Faced with a range of global crises, Goodchild proposes an alternative between strategies for survival: either submission before a Great Machine of Credit as an autonomous, unthinking system for regulating human behaviour or accession to the necessity of grace as a way of empowering the pursuit of wealth, justice and thought.",

      "abstract": "This article argues that the German Revolution of 1918\u201319 was a formative event in the politicization of Hannah Arendt and Herbert Marcuse, significantly influencing their understanding of revolutionary action and their reflections on the 1960s New Left movement. The German Revolution draws these often polarized thinkers closer together as both characterize the unfulfilled political possibility of the revolution in substantially similar ways. In the work of Arendt, the staunch critic of Marx, this highlights a critical engagement with the socialist tradition; while for Marcuse, the self-proclaimed \u201corthodox\u201d Marxist, the revolution reveals the importance of a revised idea of revolutionary action. By tracing the influence of the German Revolution on the work of these two theorists, this paper aims to recover the importance of this historical moment in their later political thought, particularly in their readings of the renewed political possibilities of the 1960s.",

Marx's theory originated in the 19th century during the industrial revolution and the rise of capitalism in Europe, and by inheriting Hegel's dialectic, he developed a historical materialist approach, focusing on the elimination of exploitation under capitalism and the struggle for the emancipation of the working class. Arendt's view of labor was formed in the twentieth century during the crisis of modernity in the West, and, drawing from the European tradition of political philosophy, attempted to rebuild the community and reestablish the freedom of the individual through a call to political action. Although the two thinkers had different theoretical aims, together they demonstrated a deep reflection on human labor and social institutions.",

Berdyaev using the example of his famous \u201cReflections on the Russian Revolution\u201d written in exile. Undoubtedly, Berdyaev is one of the few Russian philosophers who penetrated into the very essence of the Russian revolution and revealed the deepest processes of the Russian revolutionary movement. But, nevertheless, the authors of the article believe that in Berdyaev\u2019s concept, with all its undoubted merits, a whole layer of Western revolutionary heritage is undeservedly lost. This, in our opinion, makes the representation of the revolution somewhat one-sided, bringing to the fore only the negative aspects and forgetting about the positive ones. This research is aimed at identifying these gaps in the text of the Russian thinker. The scientific novelty lies in the heuristic comparison of Berdyaev\u2019s text with the Western liberal tradition. As a result, it was revealed that the Russian philosopher thinks of revolution mainly according to the \u201cFrench\u201d scenario (H. Arendt). Other options, for example, the American revolution, are practically not considered and are not significant for him. This narrows the general understanding of a revolutionary event by N. A. Berdyaev, focusing only on its \u201cspontaneous\u201d meanings.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT What is the place of compassion in politics? For Hannah Arendt, compassion \u2013 a natural fellow-feeling for a suffering other \u2013 cannot be brought into politics without damaging both the feeling and the political realm. Arendt develops this analysis in the context of her critique of the French revolution, particularly its Jacobin episode. According to Arendt, the Jacobins attempted to keep the revolution\u2019s compass fixed on unanimity and social cohesion by deploying a discourse of compassion. My reconstruction of Arendt\u2019s argument in On Revolution looks at how the Jacobins\u2019 moralisation and politicisation of compassion not only destroyed the nascent space of politics in the revolution but introduced new ways of justifying cruelty. I go on to show the role that Jacobin compassion has played in the revolutionary tradition more broadly. Read thus, Arendt\u2019s critique is not limited to the French revolution but targets a possibility that is present within the political culture of modernity \u2013 one that is activated whenever public action becomes equated with displaying virtuous pity for suffering groups.",

This article contributes with the first comparative analysis of two political theoreticians \u2013 Hannah Arendt and Ellen Meiksins Wood \u2013 whose reactivations of ancient political experiences significantly predate recent trends. Despite the fact that Arendt levelled fierce critique against the Marxist tradition of which Wood was a part, it is shown how both thinkers involved a close consideration of the relation between the social/economic and the political in their analyses; regarded Athenian forms of equality as the differentia specifica when measured against modern incarnations of democracy; committed themselves to the controversial move to grant slavery a marginal role in their analyses; turned to the American Revolution to discern the specificity of the ancient forms equality and modern democracy; and how both departed from the mainstream definitions of democracy as a list of institutions or a number of criteria. We argue that Arendt and Wood reach similar conclusions about the distinctive form of separation between the political and the social/economic in Athens, reach different conclusions about the distinctive forms of collapse and separation respectively in the modern epoch, but nonetheless unite in their critique of the American Revolution. On those premises, the central aim is to investigate how the reactivation of Athenian equality can serve as a resource for critique of three forms of equality that underpins democracy in the modern age, which we designate formal, distributive and imaginary equality.",

      "abstract": "German political philosopher Hannah Arendt (1906-75) fled from the Nazis to New York in 1941, and during the next thirty years in America she penned her best-known and most influential works, such as The Human Condition, The Origins of Totalitarianism, and On Revolution. Yet, despite the fact that a substantial portion of her oeuvre was written in America-not Europe-no one has directly considered the influence of America on her thought-until now. In Arendt and America, historian Richard H. King argues that while all of Arendt's work was haunted by her experience of totalitarianism, it was only in her adopted homeland that she was able to formulate the idea of the modern republic as an alternative to totalitarian rule. Situating Arendt within the context of US intellectual, political, and social history, King reveals how Arendt developed an extensive grasp of American constitutional history and how her idea of the American republic grew through her dialogue with the work of Alexis de Tocqueville. King also re-creates her intellectual exchanges with American friends and colleagues, such as Dwight Macdonald and Mary McCarthy, and shows how her lively correspondence with sociologist David Riesman helped her understand modern American culture and society. In the last section of Arendt and America, King sets out the context in which the Eichmann controversy took place and follows the debate about \"the banality of evil\" that has continued ever since. As King shows, Arendt's work, regardless of focus, was shaped by postwar American thought, culture, and politics, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Cold War. For Arendt, the United States was much more than a refuge from Nazi Germany; it was a stimulus to rethink the political, ethical, and historical traditions of human culture. This authoritative combination of intellectual history and biography offers a unique approach for thinking about the influence of America on Arendt's ideas and also the effect of her ideas on American thought.",

      "abstract": "The article focuses on the philosophical issues surrounding the establishment of revolution as a concept in its modern sense, as an intervention of something new that breaks from the past and produces a gap between tradition and innovation. The common interpretation of this process implies a linear conception of time, while at the same time describing the event of revolution as an implementation of this conception in a political sense. The article refers to the two prevailing works on the subject, that being of Hannah Arendt and of Reinhart Koselleck. While Arendt describes the French Revolution as an event resulting in \u201cnewness\u201d being injected into politics and thus opening history up to its future disavowing the repetition, where as Koselleck promoted the notion of universal history disavowing chance. In any case, both believe that it is due to the phenomenon of revolution being invented as history. But the concept was not pulled out of thin air. Arendt\u2019s and Koselleck\u2019s analysis involves philological accounts of the etymology and history of the word \u201crevolution,\u201d showing its radical change in meaning. Initially revolution meant exactly what was subsequently excluded from the notion of history, though also established as a result of revolution, repetition and chance. The article aims to demonstrate that this traditional interpretation misses another idea of repetition which doesn\u2019t contradict \u201cnewness\u201d but, on the contrary, produces it. Thus it is not simply a denial of repetition that constitutes revolution, but displacement of repetition understood as a cycle and coming to the forefront of the repetition which we interpret as a chance.",

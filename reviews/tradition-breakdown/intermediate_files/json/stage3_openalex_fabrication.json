      "abstract": "Abstract This paper elaborates an aspirations\u2013capabilities framework to advance our understanding of human mobility as an intrinsic part of broader processes of social change. In order to achieve a more meaningful understanding of agency and structure in migration processes, this framework conceptualises migration as a function of aspirations and capabilities to migrate within given sets of perceived geographical opportunity structures. It distinguishes between the instrumental (means-to-an-end) and intrinsic (directly wellbeing-affecting) dimensions of human mobility. This yields a vision in which moving and staying are seen as complementary manifestations of migratory agency and in which human mobility is defined as people\u2019s capability to choose where to live, including the option to stay, rather than as the act of moving or migrating itself. Drawing on Berlin\u2019s concepts of positive and negative liberty (as manifestations of the widely varying structural conditions under which migration occurs) this paper conceptualises how macro-structural change shapes people\u2019s migratory aspirations and capabilities. The resulting framework helps to understand the complex and often counter-intuitive ways in which processes of social transformation and \u2018development\u2019 shape patterns of migration and enable us to integrate the analysis of almost all forms of migratory mobility within one meta-conceptual framework.",

Often considered by Western textile and fashion historians to be a parallel industry to the production of woven shawls of the Kashmir style in France and Britain, further investigation suggests the contrary. The manufacture of Russian tapestry-technique shawls developed as a distinctly separate industry, addressing nineteenth-century Russia\u2019s established shawl trade and shifting geopolitics. The Russians continued the production of these extravagant shawls long after the Kashmir shawl\u2019s fall from fashion grace in the West due to a variety of influences:\\n\u2022 Russian nationalism in the decorative arts during the reign of Emperor Nicholas I (1825-1855)\u2022 The industrialization of Imperial Russia\u2019s textile industry\u2022 Russia\u2019s Southern expansion of her empire\\nWhile providing a glimpse into textile production in Imperial Russia, the fabrication of handwoven, tapestry-technique shawls also communicates the desire of a nineteenth-century empire that had emulated Western European traditions for over one-hundred twentyfive years to close itself off finally from the ways of the West. These shawls aided in re-establishing a truly Russian identity in the decorative and applied arts.",

Myths of origin and election, memories of a greater and purer past, and narratives of persecution and mission are required for the production and maintenance of powerful national sentiments. Through an investigation of how early modern Catholics and Protestants reimagined, reinterpreted, and rewrote the lives of the founder-saints who spread Christianity in England, this book offers a theoretical framework for the study of origin narratives. Analyzing the discursive construction of time and place, the invocation of forces beyond the human to naturalize and authorize, and the role of visual and ritual culture in fabrications of the past, this book provides a case study for how to approach claims about founding figures. Serving as a timely example of the dependence of national identity on key religious resources, Griffin shows how origin narratives \u2013 particularly the founding figures that anchor them \u2013 function as uniquely powerful rhetorical tools for the cultural production of regional and national identity.",

At the heart of the debate is an older theoretical question: Is race best understood under an essentialist or constructivist framework? In contrast to the \u201cimmutable characteristics\u201d or essentialist approach, we argue that race should be operationalized as a \u201cbundle of sticks\u201d that can be disaggregated into elements. With elements of race, causal claims may be possible using two designs: (a) studies that measure the effect of exposure to a racial cue and (b) studies that exploit within-group variation to measure the effect of some manipulable element. These designs can reconcile scholarship on race and causation and offer a clear framework for future research.",

Reid identifies and examines key points of rupture and transition in Uganda&amp;apos;s history, emphasising dramatic political and social change in the precolonial era, especially during the nineteenth century, and he also examines the continuing repercussions of these developments in the colonial and postcolonial periods. By considering the ways in which historical culture and consciousness has been ever present - in political discourse, art and literature, and social relationships - Reid defines the true extent of Uganda&amp;apos;s viable national history.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mass incarceration, police brutality, and border controls are part and parcel of the everyday experiences of marginalized and racialized communities across the world. Recent scholarship in international relations, sociology, and geography has examined the prevalence of these coercive practices through the prism of \u201cdisciplinary,\u201d \u201cpenal,\u201d or \u201cauthoritarian\u201d neoliberalism. In this collective discussion, we argue that although this literature has brought to the fore neoliberalism's reliance on state violence, it has yet to interrogate how these carceral measures are linked to previous forms of global racial ordering. To rectify this moment of \u201ccolonial unknowing,\u201d the collective discussion draws on decolonial approaches, Indigenous studies, and theories of racial capitalism. It demonstrates that \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cneoliberal\u201d forms of domestic control must be situated within the global longue dur\u00e9e of racialized and colonial accumulation by dispossession. By mapping contemporary modes of policing, incarceration, migration control, and surveillance onto earlier forms of racial\u2013colonial subjugation, we argue that countering the violence of neoliberalism requires more than nostalgic appeals for a return to Keynesianism. What is needed is abolition\u2014not just of the carceral archipelago, but of the very system of racial capitalism that produces and depends on these global vectors of organized violence and abandonment.",

      "abstract": "The analysis of medicinal plants has had a long history, and especially with regard to assessing a plant's quality. The first techniques were organoleptic using the physical senses of taste, smell, and appearance. Then gradually these led on to more advanced instrumental techniques. Though different countries have their own traditional medicines China currently leads the way in terms of the number of publications focused on medicinal plant analysis and number of inclusions in their Pharmacopoeia. The monographs contained within these publications give directions on the type of analysis that should be performed, and for manufacturers, this typically means that they need access to more and more advanced instrumentation. We have seen developments in many areas of analytical analysis and particularly the development of chromatographic and spectroscopic methods and the hyphenation of these techniques. The ability to process data using multivariate analysis software has opened the door to metabolomics giving us greater capacity to understand the many variations of chemical compounds occurring within medicinal plants, allowing us to have greater certainty of not only the quality of the plants and medicines but also of their suitability for clinical research. Refinements in technology have resulted in the ability to analyze and categorize plants effectively and be able to detect contaminants and adulterants occurring at very low levels. However, advances in technology cannot provide us with all the answers we need in order to deliver high-quality herbal medicines and the more traditional techniques of assessing quality remain as important today.",

      "abstract": "Following significant interethnic violence beginning in 2008, Chinese intellectuals and policymakers are now engaged in unprecedented debate over the future direction of their country's ethnic policies. This study attempts to gauge current Chinese opinion on this once-secretive and still highly sensitive area of national policy.Domestic Chinese opinion on ethnic policies over the last five years is reviewed and implications for future policies under the new leadership of CPC Secretary General Xi Jinping are explored. Careful review of a wide spectrum of contemporary Chinese commentary identifies an emerging consensus for ethnic-policy reform. Leading public intellectuals, as well as some party officials, now openly call for new measures strengthening national integration at the expense of minority rights and autonomy. These reformers argue that divisive ethnic policies adopted from the former USSR must be replaced by those supporting an ethnic \"melting pot\" concept.Despite this important shift in opinion, such radical policy changes as ending regional ethnic autonomy or minority preferences are unlikely over the short-to-medium term. Small-yet-significant adjustments in rhetoric and policy emphasis are, however, expected as the party-state attempts to strengthen interethnic cohesiveness as a part of its larger agenda of stability maintenance.",

Addressing these crisis conditions is urgent, yet critical interventions indicate that prevailing accounts inadequately address the scale, complexity, and fluidity of racisms operating today. This article proposes to think racial logics \u2018otherwise\u2019 by drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship and intersectional analytics to produce a genealogy of state/nation formation processes, imperial encounters, and legitimating ideologies that illuminates how \u2018intimacy builds worlds\u2019. 1 A deep history of political centralisation reveals that regulation of intimate, familial relations is a constitutive feature of successful state-making and crucial for understanding how modernity's \u2018race difference\u2019 is produced and how the racialisation of \u2018Other\u2019 (\u2018non-European\u2019, undesirable) sexual/familial practices figures in contemporary crises. Locating intimate relations \u2013 \u2018family\u2019 \u2013 in (birthright) citizenship, immigration regimes, and political-economic frames helps clarify the amplification of global inequalities and the power of stigmatisations to fuel nationalist attachments and anti-migrant hostilities. Foregrounding intimacy and integrating typically disparate lines of inquiry advances our analyses of today's often opaque yet intense racisms and their globally problematic effects.",

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has become a dominant policy actor in the governance of European education; this was the result of its deliberate and systematic mobilization by the European Commission (EC), which found in the OECD not only a great resource of data to govern (which it did not have before) but also a player who would be pushing the Commission's own policy agenda forward, albeit leaving the old subsidiarity rule intact. The article discusses the role of experts in this emergent European policy field through an examination of 'policy mobilization'; using the concepts of boundary work and 'boundary organization', the article shows how the OECD has transformed into a 'site of coproduction' of both knowledge and social order (St Clair, A.L., 2006.

      "abstract": "The giant composite field of colonialism and postcolonialism studies has had a transforming effect on modern anthropology. Anthropologists have been innovative users of its multidisciplinary perspectives, and key contributors to its challenging accounts of past and contemporary global life and experience. The call to prioritise colonial and postcolonial perspectives in the framing of anthropology's central research questions has greatly extended the field's range and scope, including its distinctive approaches to the issue of whether it is colonialism that should be seen as modernity's most important progenitor, and the source of its most toxic forms of subjugation and disempowerment. This entry notes the sophistication with which anthropology has both embraced and challenged the forms of cultural and social analysis through which the epistemic and material transformations of global empire and its afterlife have been documented and theorised. And it argues that studies of colonialism and postcolonialism still have a strong and productive future in a world now widely thought to require the multidimensional framings provided by today's high-profile theorists of globalisation and cosmopolitanism.",

      "abstract": "This paper attempts to critically examine the approaches that were employed by Africans in their knowledge, skills and attitudes acquisition before, after and during colonialisation of the continent. The paper looks at three distinctive epochs from which the perfect understanding of how learning in Africa transformed could be concluded. It is notable that there was a period before Africa got colonised, which was followed by the period during colonisation, before the independence of the continent. The position that is strongly advanced through this paper is that even before colonialism the African societies offered training to their members, which was characterized by the provision of survival skills to individuals who were supposed to selflessly serve their societies. Members of African societies learnt through their interaction with their physical and spiritual milieus, as evidenced by their design of tools which they used mostly in their agro activities and in fighting for resources. The other area in which learning took place was that of spirituality or mysticism, as some superstitious members of African communities were believed to have powers of communicating with their ancestors. As noted by Westerlund (1991), the belief in the ancestors is widespread in many African agricultural areas and like divinities and nature spirits, the spirits of ancestors are thought to be intermediaries between God and humankind. The main problem that this paper is intended to advance is that Africa is regarded by some people as having not had any form of education before the arrival of the colonialists and their educational establishments or organisations. This paper therefore raises an argument against this position.",

However, coal remains entangled with contentious development agendas in many parts of the world, while fossil fuel industries continue to flourish. This article discusses these entanglements through a climate justice lens that engages the cultural politics surrounding coal and energy transition. We highlight how recent struggles around phasing out coal have stimulated renewed critical debates around colonialism, empire, and capitalism more broadly, recognizing climate change as an intersectional issue encompassing racial, gender, and economic justice. With social movements locked in struggles to resist the development or expansion of coal mines, power plants, and associated infrastructure, we unpack tensions that emerge as transnational alliances connect disparate communities across the world. Our conclusion signals the need for greater critical engagement with how intersecting inequalities are coded into the cultural politics of coal, and how this shapes efforts to pursue a just transition.",

      "abstract": "The creation of an EU Framework for national Roma integration strategies (2011) marks a significant step in the politicisation of Roma identity by ensuring a further increase in the number of initiatives, projects and programmes explicitly targeting Roma. The Framework itself is part of a process that began with postcommunist transition and which has produced historically unprecedented levels of Roma political activism along with a proliferation of national and transnational policy initiatives focussed on Roma identity. In seeking to explain this contemporary political phenomenon, the article argues that Roma is an identity constructed at the intersection of political and expert knowledge by various actors, such as policymakers, Romani activists, international organizations and scholars. This political-expert identity is applied to groups that are not bounded by a common language, religion, cultural practice, geographic location, occupation, physical appearance or lifestyle. The article explores how this collation of disparate populations into a notional political community builds upon a centuries-old Gypsy legacy. It scrutinizes five strands of identification practices that have contributed to the longue dur\u00e9e development of today\u2019s Roma as an epistemic object and policy target: police profiling of particular communities; administrative surveys; Romani activism; Roma targeted policies; quantitative scientific research. The article argues that the contemporary economic and political conditions amidst which the politicisation of Roma identity is occurring explain how the ideological and institutional construction of the ethnic frame tends toward the reinforcement of the exclusion of those categorised as Roma, thus increasing the perceived need for Roma policy initiatives. A self-sustaining cycle has been created where Roma knowledge identifies Roma problems requiring a policy response, which produces more Roma knowledge, more needs and more policy responses. Yet, there are consequences to racialising public discourse by presenting Roma as both problematic and essentially different from everyone else. Hostility towards Roma has increased in many states indicating that the expert framing of Roma groupness affects social solidarity by disconnecting and distancing Roma from their fellow citizens.",

      "abstract": "During the past decade, particularly under the presidency of the third Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko (2005\u20132010) there have been repeated attempts to turn the leading fi gures of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and its armed wing, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) into national heroes. As these fascist organizations collaborated with the Nazi Germany, carried out ethnic cleansing and mass murder on a massive scale, they are problematic symbols for an aspiring democracy with the stated ambition to join the European Union. Under Yushchenko, several institutes of memory management and myth making were organized, a key function of which was to deny or downplay OUN-UPA atrocities. Unlike many other former Soviet republics, the Ukrainian government did not need to develop new national myths from scratch, but imported ready concepts developed in the Ukrainian diaspora. Yushchenko\u2019s legitimizing historians presented the OUN and UPA as pluralistic and inclusive organizations, which not only rescued Jews during the Holocaust, but invited them into their ranks to fight shoulder to shoulder against Hitler and Stalin. This mythical narrative relied partly on the OUN\u2019s own post-war forgeries, aimed at cover up the organization\u2019s problematic past. As employees of the Ukrainian security services, working out of the offices of the old KGB, the legitimizing historians ironically dismissed scholarly criticism as Soviet myths. The present study deals with the myth-making around the OUN, the UPA, and the Holocaust, tracing their diaspora roots and following their migration back and forth across the Atlantic.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIn his book The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta(1955), author Montagu Slater claims to offer a \u201cfair\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d account of the Kenyan nationalist leader\u2019s trial in a British colonial court. However, by including a mere fraction of the 2000+-page trial transcript, Slater amplifies certain aspects of the proceedings, including an instance of literal amplification: at one point, the judge considers whether or not an audio recording of one of Kenyatta\u2019s public speeches to a group of mostly illiterate Kenyans is admissible as documentary evidence. In this moment, the question is asked: what, according to the law, is a \u201cdocument,\u201d particularly when the culture in question is an oral culture? This essay situates Slater\u2019s representation of this question, and the court\u2019s answer, in the context of African oral law, conflicts between orality and literacy in colonial Kenya, and the war with Mau Mau, the militant liberation movement that Kenyatta was accused of leading. Slater\u2019s text ultimately offers, through selective amplification, a crucial critique of colonial law, showing how its claims to modernity are undermined by its inability to keep up with its own narrative of progress, whereas African \u201ctraditions\u201d freely adapt to and, thereby, redefine modernity in a moment of intense political, cultural, and legal crisis.Keywords: colonial lawcursecrisis of modernitydocumentelectronic cultureevidenceKenyaKenya African Union (KAU)Jomo KenyattaKikuyuliteracyMau Maunonfictionoathsoralityoral lawQueen against Kenyatta and others (1952)Montagu SlaterState of EmergencyThe Trial of Jomo Kenyatta (1955)traditional law Notes1. Kenyatta was born in the 1890s (the exact date is unknown) in Gatundu, Kenya. His early education was in Scottish Mission schools, and in the 1920s, he joined the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA), a political organization that petitioned the British Government to recognize the rights of the Kikuyu people, particularly with respect to land issues. In 1929, the KCA sent Kenyatta to London to negotiate directly with the British Government, and he remained there, except for brief visits to Kenya, until 1946 . While there, he studied anthropology with Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics. At the outset of World War II, the Kenyan government banned KCA, and it was replaced by a new nationalist organization, the Kenya African Union (KAU). KAU embraced Kenyatta as its leader upon his return to Kenya after the war, and it was during his tenure as KAU\u2019s leader that Kenyatta was arrested and tried for managing Mau Mau. Mau Mau was a militant outgrowth of KAU. Many of the younger members of KAU were dissatisfied with the moderate politics of the Kikuyu leadership and, thus, galvanized around a few of those who felt that direct and even violent action was necessary. See David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (New York & London: Norton, 2005), 35\u201343. [Google Scholar]2. From the dust jacket synopsis of Montagu Slater, The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta (London: Secker & Warburg, 1957 [1955]). [Google Scholar]3. Slater is best known as a cofounder of The Left Review and its original editor. Additionally, he famously wrote the libretto for Benjamin Britten\u2019s opera Peter Grimes (1945), which opens with a court inquest over the death of Grimes\u2019 apprentice and is set in a seaside village. Interestingly, Britten\u2019s other opera dealing with law and set at sea is an adaptation of Billy Budd (1951). This time, however, the libretto was written by Eric Crozier and E. M. Forster, whose novel A Passage To India (1924) is another colonial narrative concerned with the forms of the law.4. I recognize the problems inherent in the term \u201ctradition\u201d in contexts like this where, through contact with colonial culture, African \u201ctraditions\u201d are not always what they seem. Many change, some remain the same, and others are complete fabrications. Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger\u2019s The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992) [Google Scholar] has been useful in this regard, and I thus use the term \u201ctradition\u201d tentatively, with an awareness of its complications but also with a recognition that, for my purposes, it continues to serve a useful function: namely, to identify those practices and beliefs that colonial modernity was supposed to displace or supersede in some way.5.

Alison Dundes Renteln & Alan Dundes, eds., Folk Law: Essays in the Theory and Practice of Lex Non Scripta, vol. 1 (New York & London: Garland Publishing, 1994), 1:395 [Google Scholar]. \u201cFolk law\u201d is their term for what I am calling \u201ctraditional law\u201d and, as they recognize, is variously identified as \u201ccustomary law, unwritten law, common law, indigenous law, living law, primitive law, etc.\u201d (xiii). They define folk law as \u201ca socially defined group\u2019s orally transmitted traditional body of obligations and prohibitions, sanctioned or required by that group, binding upon individuals or subsets of individuals (e.g., families, clans) under pain of punishment or forfeiture.\u201d9. This phenomenon is, of course, not limited to Africa as Renteln and Dundes\u2019s collection demonstrates. In fact, there have been periods in European history when laws were expressed in and through cultural narratives and oral traditions rather than codified statutes and constitutions. See, for example, Herman Baltl\u2019s \u201cFolklore Research and Legal History in the German Language Area\u201d in Renteln & Dundes\u2019s collection (id. at 397\u2013406) [Google Scholar]; also see Robert Cover, \u201cForeword: Nomos and Narrative,\u201d 97/1 Harvard Law Review 4\u201368 (1983) [Google Scholar], in which he describes a connection between the epics of early European societies and their laws.10.

[Google Scholar]18. Ng\u0169g\u0129 was, of course, writing in the postcolonial period, and although The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (with Micere Githae Mugo, 1976) deals with the Mau Mau period, Ng\u0169g\u0131\u02dc\u2019s concern is with the legacy of colonial law within the postcolonial nation-state. In my study of Ng\u0169g\u0131\u02dc\u2019s work in my dissertation, I demonstrate how oral culture continues to offer authors such as Okot and Ng\u0169g\u0131\u02dc means of critiquing the contradictions and oppressive measures of postcolonial law, which bears the residues and, at times, exact form of the colonial legal system. See Peter Leman, \u201cLiterature, Law, and Oral Culture in East Africa\u201d (PhD diss., University of California, Irvine, 2011). [Google Scholar]19. The colonial recognition of traditional African law is also evident in the development of the system of \u201cindirect rule,\u201d by which African \u201ccustomary law\u201d was permitted to function within limited, rural jurisdictions while Western-style law was administered in urban areas. The reasoning, as articulated most influentially by Frederick Lugard, was that Africans were less likely to reject colonial rule if the revered customs and traditions that ordered their societies were integrated into the administrative structure. See Lugard, The Dual Mandate of British Tropical Africa (Hamden, CT: Archon Books, [1922] 1965) [Google Scholar]. The problem was that British administrators often assumed too much in identifying this or that practice as \u201ccustomary\u201d or \u201ctraditional,\u201d frequently selecting and codifying practices arbitrarily or inventing traditions out of thin air if circumstances required it. Additionally, problems with the system arose as \u201ctraditional\u201d chiefs were appointed to oversee customary courts when such offices were not recognized by or even, in some cases, previously existent within a given society. These colonial-appointed chiefs came to exercise a great deal of power and were often distrusted by the people whose customs they were supposedly there to protect. Furthermore, whereas indirect rule supposedly preserved African customs, the \u201claws\u201d were often written down for the purposes of practical codification, and according to a report following a Judicial Advisers Conference in 1953, the ultimate goal was to help customary law evolve so that, in time, there would be \u201ca fully integrated system administering one law for all.\u201d See \u201cNative Courts and Native Customary Law in Africa,\u201d Judicial Advisers\u2019 Conference, special supplement to the Journal of African Administration 21 (1953) [Google Scholar].

Six defendants were convicted in the original trial, but one of them was acquitted on appeal.23. The meaning of the term \u201cMau Mau\u201d is one aspect of the phenomenon that has contributed to scholars\u2019 mystification in that its precise meaning and origin have been difficult to determine. Different interpretations have been offered, with some suggesting lexical affinities with the Kenya Africa Union\u2019s acronym (i.e., KAU) and others arguing that Mau Mau was the popular name given by the government to add to the organization\u2019s mysteriousness and, thus, people\u2019s fear of it.

The horrific irony of this is that, whereas the detention camps were supposedly based on this angelic and altruistic theory of \u201cguided transition,\u201d the reality proved that the war brought out the worst in many of the colonialists and loyalist Africans (id. at 410). The conditions of the camps and the atrocities committed against prisoners were so severe that their discovery by the outside world toward the end of the Emergency is thought to have rapidly accelerated Britain\u2019s withdrawal from East Africa.

Considered a pioneer in the study of human origins, Leakey trained in archaeology, paleo-anthropology, and social anthropology at Cambridge University and was extremely prolific, publishing 216 books, monographs, articles, book reviews, and letters over his lifetime. Described by Lonsdale and Berman as Kenyatta\u2019s intellectual rival, Leakey, significantly, was initially appointed as the court translator in Kenyatta\u2019s 1952 trial but stormed out in a rage after being accused by the defense of deliberately mistranslating witness testimony to the prosecution\u2019s favor.

Edgerton goes on to describe how other government-produced reports went into even more detail about shockingly bizarre sexual and bestial practices used in Mau Mau oathing, which I won\u2019t reproduce here. The irony of such allegations is that, because they were typically exaggerations or pure fabrications, the horrifying narratives actually originated in British, not African, minds.44. Id. at 135.45.

Dinesen\u2019s use of the word \u201catavism\u201d is particularly ironic here as it suggests for her a certain aristocratic prestige, whereas during the Mau Mau period it came to denote the African\u2019s retreat into the darkness of primitive and savage superstitions. Slater\u2019s suggestion, I contend, is that the charge of atavism directed at Mau Mau is, in fact, a projection of the actual atavism, or rejection of modernity, that characterized colonial rule since its beginnings.63.

Well before the Hellenistic period, the Jewish tradition had already created its own perfect enemy whose very name became synonymous of Israel's most malicious antagonist: Edom. This article aims to study the changing attitudes towards the Edomites/Idumaeans from the late Judaean kingdom to the Roman period using a long\u2010dur\u00e9e perspective, particularly the growth of memories of humiliation and feelings of resentment product of the alleged crimes of Edom during Judah's fall and exile.",

      "abstract": "The black Dutch feminist Gloria Wekker, assembling past and present everyday expressions of racialized imagination which collectively undermine hegemonic beliefs that white Dutch society has no historic responsibility for racism, writes in her book White Innocence that \u2018one can do postcolonial studies very well without ever critically addressing race\u2019 (p. 175). Two and a half decades after the adaptation of postcolonial thought to explain aspects of cultural politics during the break-up of Yugoslavia created important tools for understanding the construction of national, regional and socio-economic identities around hierarchical notions of \u2018Europe\u2019 and \u2018the Balkans\u2019 in the Yugoslav region and beyond, Wekker\u2019s observation is still largely true for south-east European studies, where no intervention establishing race and whiteness as categories of analysis has reframed the field like work by Maria Todorova on \u2018balkanism\u2019 or Milica Baki\u0107-Hayden on \u2018symbolic geographies\u2019 and \u2018nesting orientalism\u2019 did in the early 1990s. Critical race theorists such as Charles Mills nevertheless argue that \u2018race\u2019 as a structure of thought and feeling that legitimised colonialism and slavery (and still informs structural white supremacy) involved precisely the kind of essentialised link between people and territory that south-east European cultural theory also critiques: the construction of spatialised hierarchies specifying which peoples and territories could have more or less access to civilisation and modernity. South-east European studies\u2019 latent racial exceptionalism has some roots in the race-blind anti-colonial solidarities of state socialist internationalism (further intensified for Yugoslavia through the politics of Non-Alignment) but also, this paper suggests, in deeper associations between Europeanness, whiteness and modernity that remain part of the history of \u2018Europe\u2019 as an idea even if, by the end of the 20th century, they were silenced more often than voiced.",

Premodern ways of negotiating memories of pain and loss, for instance, were indeed quite different to those in the modern West. Yet by examining memory practices and drawing on evidence from early modern England, France, Germany, Ireland, Hungary, the Low Countries and Ukraine, the case studies in this volume highlight the extent to which early modern memory was already a multimedia affair, with many political uses, and affecting stakeholders at all levels of society.",

      "abstract": "his ideas.Anderson sympathised with how Tom Nairn (a close collaborator and co-author on New Left Review with Perry Anderson) took up a pro-Scottish position in The Break-Up of Britain (1978) and disagreed with Eric Hobsbawm's assault on that book, including the assertion that a Marxist could not be a nationalist.Anderson also took against the 'Eurocentric' bias of writing on nationalism.IC's first set of cases are drawn from late 18th century colonial America on the grounds that nationalism originated there and subsequently spread to Europe.Later chapters use Southeast Asian examples, distinguishing IC from most general studies of nationalism with their European focus.It was with the publication of IC in 1983 that Anderson came to the attention of a wide readership.With about 64,000 citations to date (May 2016) on Google Scholar, IC is the fifth-most cited book in the social sciences and by far the most cited text in the study of nationalism. 4The book has gone through three English language editions (1983, 1991, 2006) which have sold a total of about half-a-million copies to date, an extraordinarily high figure for an 'academic' book. 5This excludes sales for the many translations.The 1991 edition was expanded by two chapters: one on maps, censuses and museums; the other on 'memory and forgetting'.The 2006 edition added an afterword chronicling the translations of the book into 29 different languages published in 33 different countries.In our contemporary academic culture with its fixation on 'metrics' to estimate the 'impact' of 'outputs', such figures suggest an enormous impact.A 'UoA' (Unit of Assessment) that could lay claim to Ben Anderson and IC in the REF 6 would be very happy.However, such measures raise more questions than they answer, even at the metric level.Take translations, for example.There were none before 1987.Between then and 1991 came four translations of the first edition (Japanese, Portugese, German, Serbo-Croat) plus a 1992 Korean pirated translation.Between 1992 and 1999 there were 15 further translations from the second edition.These include a surge in the late 1990s of east European translations made possible by financial support from the billionaire Georg Soros.There were nine further translations between 2000 and 2006.Sometimes there was a second translation into a particular language, especially if the first was unauthorised and/or bad. 7 This suggests that the biggest impact came in the late 1980s and through the 90s.Unfortunately Verso do not have information on sales of each of the three English editions, let alone annual figures that could enable us to plot a sales trajectory.However, my guess would be that the peak period was in the decade from the late 1980s.This tallies with the 'rise of nationalism studies' measured in other ways.Social scientists in the 1960s, 1970s and the early 1980s were not interested in nationalism as a distinct subject.The slow decline and then rapid collapse of the Soviet Union and communist regimes throughout east and central Europe is the most obvious reason for a surge in interest.Certain academic specialisms (Cold War studies, Kremlinology) were suddenly marginalised.The shift to 'hot wars' following the end of super-power imposed 'peace' was accompanied by ethnic conflict and violence (e.g.former Yugoslavia, Rwanda,",

Drawing on longstanding debates about nations and nationalism, it is possible to trace the roots of this distinction and see how it has taken on new significance in contemporary memory studies. I outline a few assumptions about humans as meaning makers, users of cultural tools, and \u201ccognitive misers\u201d and then turn to oppositions that have been drawn between collective memory and formal history. These concern the degree of subjectivity or objectivity involved, the source of authority for narrative tools, and the willingness to sacrifice evidence to preserve a narrative account about the past or vice versa. In order to translate these oppositions into more concrete means for discussing memory and history, I introduce a distinction between \u201cspecific narratives\u201d and \u201cnarrative templates,\u201d and I examine the source of \u201cethnocentric narcissism\u201d that characterizes memory to a greater degree than history. Insight into this issue can be derived from drawing out William James\u2019s comments on the \u201cme-ness\u201d of individual human memory to examine the \u201cus-ness\u201d of collective memory.",

      "abstract": "IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, subaltern historians and postcolonial scholars have brought to our attention the need to question the generally assumed universality of Western categories in framing the histories of the rest of the world.1 The exclusive deployment of Western concepts to explain historical development in India and other non-Western countries, they say, not only has marginalized indigenous systems of knowledge and practices, but has also resulted in the histories of these countries being presented in negative terms as a deviation from the universal trajectories of capital, democracy, and liberalism, which are themselves grounded in particular historical experiences of the West. Thus, as Dipesh Chakrabarty, among others, has argued, most scholars trained in this intellectual tradition have characterized India as \u201cnot modern\u201d or \u201cnot bourgeois\u201d or \u201cnot liberal.\u201d The new intellectual sensitivity toward non-Western systems of thought has resulted in a significant number of works that deploy the critical category of difference. Yet none of the four major schools of historiography on modern India\u2014Marxist, Cambridge, nationalist, and subaltern\u2014has extended this notion of difference to the discourse of freedom associated with the Gandhian nonviolent resistance movement against British colonialism. This is a surprising omission, given the striking ways in which the Gandhian discourse of freedom departed from the Western discourse of freedom. While the distinctiveness of the Gandhian movement in relation to other forms of anticolonial resistance of the day was evident to Gandhi\u2019s contemporaries and has been noted by scholars, the use of difference as an analytical category to",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;With China\u2019s rapid growth as a regional and global power, think tanks in China have received increasing attention from politicians and academics, mostly due to the achievements of academic and processing policies. Recently, collaborations between the media and think tanks have become increasingly tight. This article aims to explore China\u2019s think tank industry and their relationship with the media by interviewing two members of staff from one of China\u2019s most prominent think tanks and observing the Institute for six months. This study has found that China\u2019s think tanks have a close relationship with the government and the media. The traditional Chinese Confucian culture and the \"bureaucracy-oriented tradition\" have a significant role in the think tanks\u2019 political behavior. This leads the think tanks to play the role of being an advocate of the government. Although social media, to some extent, liberalizes the work style of China\u2019s think tanks, the think tanks\u2019 use of social media still follows the traditional media logic to facilitate the government\u2019s interests. Overall, the study argues that Chinese think tanks show features of being a \u201cGovernment-lead non-governmental organization\" with a semi-official identity to complement the official authorities.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, Russia has championed the primacy of national governments in managing the global internet. Scholars attribute Russia's global internet governance philosophy and practices predominantly to its increasingly authoritarian and illiberal regime under President Vladimir Putin. This article, by contrast, explores how Russian ruling elites' view of Russia as an immutable great power has directed the subsequent Russian governments' pursuit of a state-based multipolar digital order. To illuminate cultural continuities in Russia's approach to global communication governance in the post-Soviet period, I examine its state-centric policymaking initiatives at the International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations in the 1990s.",

      "abstract": "Childhood is often defined by social marginalization\u2014 by a denial of access to public space and voice, and the circumscription of what interests, issues, and discourses are open to young people. The internet, as a space of expression that has lowered barriers to entry and confounded attempts at social control, is one of the primary spaces in which 21st-century youth are able to resist adult efforts to regulate their agency and expression. However, it is not only the technological tools of the online world that help them to resist marginalization from public discourse in these spaces, but also its symbolic and cultural resources\u2014shared ideas, practices, and vocabularies particular to online communities. As part of larger projects on teens\u2019 and young adults\u2019 use of online communities to engage with cultural politics, I have been investigating the use of memes\u2014patterns of formulaic content that rise and fall in popularity in short periods of time\u2014in social critique, ideological discourse, community building, and identity representation. This paper examines the impact of memes on cultural discourse and, indirectly, on institutional politics, exploring their potential as an empowering channel of expression as well as their ongoing use as a tool of manipulation by larger political forces. I argue that understanding the cultural power of memes and other aspects of online remix culture is vital to theorizing contemporary politics, to analyzing the experiences and identities of contemporary youth, and to preventing the worst eventualities the increasing significance of online cultural politics may enable.",

      "abstract": "From the late 1980s onward, global social theory has been introduced to a new perspective variously called indigeneity, endogeneity, Orientalism, Eurocentrism, post-colonial, decolonial, and Southern sociology/social sciences. This study argues that the above-mentioned trends should be collectively termed anti-colonial social theory as all of these explore the relationship between colonialism and knowledge production. The study divides the growth of anti-colonial social theory in terms of two phases and relates it to changing geopolitics of the 20th century. It argues that these distinct trends manifest a united stance in its ontological-epistemic articulation. It also argues that anti-colonial social theory can play a relevant role in a knowledge system divided through colonial/imperial relationships, given its theorization on the same.",

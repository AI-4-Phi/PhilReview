      "abstract": "\n Organized sport in the Weimar Republic was dominated by three strands\u2014so-called bourgeois sport, the gymnastics movement (Turnen) and the workers\u2019 sports movement (Arbeitersport). While scholarship has rightly pointed out the differences between their federations, it has neglected a significant feature they had in common: the struggle to communicate key messages to their members. For the first time, this article examines debates about and developments in the communications of Weimar\u2019s leading sports organizations. It shows that through the 1920s producing journals, running news services and lobbying the press became as important as competing in or watching sport itself, as the organizations sought to raise their profile, gain new members and retain the members they already had. Each of them, while envying the others, failed to meet its goals for similar reasons: inadequate internal structures, poor decision-making and the allure of commercialized sport and the papers and magazines it fed and produced. While scholarship has often noted the high level of sports coverage in the mainstream press, it has not explored the dynamic pull of such reporting on readers. By examining the effects of the professional media on the active members of the three main federations, this article therefore also sheds light on the power of new forms of writing and entertainment to influence individuals as the shift to consumer habits increased in all social classes throughout the Weimar Republic. In doing so, it bridges between empirically orientated forms of sports history and cultural histories of the press.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims to examine the institutional causes of the democratic breakdown of the Weimar Republic. To accomplish that purpose following problems were set: firstly, paper discusses current state of democracy throughout the world, its issues and challenges. Paper also underlines global trend of democratic decline. That discussion is provided to draw parallels and pinpoint relevance of the analysis. Afterwards, the research examines German political system, democratic roots and development. Moreover, constitutional changes and checks and balances are analyzed as well. The paper particularly scrutinizes evolution of German political parties and specifics of electoral system. Institutional heritage of regime change is also unveiled. The paper underlines pitfalls of Weimar Republic\u2019s institutions that led to democratic breakdown. Apart from it, research generally outlines socio-economic background of Weimar Republic. During the research examination of documents, content analysis, comparative and historical methods were applied. The paper concludes that regarding to its institutional weakness, that is absence of electoral threshold, fragmentation of parliament and political parties, the abundance of social associations, semi-presidential system and socioeconomic situation created ground for an authoritarian takeover of the Weimar Republic.",

      "abstract": "Much of the literature on the breakdown of the Weimar Republic has focused exclusively on elite competition or the political extremes for which young people got involved. This chapter sheds a different light on the importance of democratic youth involvement. After contextualizing the episode and bringing out the contradictory reality of the Weimar Republic between high culture and political failure, the complexities of youth political involvement are explored. A large proportion of the discourse on youth emphasized the pro-democratic character of youth mobilization. However, the divisions within the pro-democratic formation ultimately underlined that the political mobilization linked to it was too weak to stabilize the regime. Instead, the contradictory aspirations for the future of German democracy meant that democratic consolidation eventually failed whilst anti-regime mobilization grew.",

The process was influenced by historical events and the political situation in which the Latvian people found themselves, thus necessitating the drafting of a constitution that would meet the current needs of the people and the country, strengthening the ideas of parliamentarism, democracy and republic. Influenced by diverse parliamentary representation, the Constitution combined elements from various legal traditions, including the Weimar Constitution, the U.S., and others, while adapting them to Latvian circumstances. It marked a transition from imperial rule to a democratic republic, rooted in parliamentary and republican principles. The study examines the choices made by the Constituent Assembly, the sources of law used and the diverse considerations in the drafting process of the various concepts enshrined in the Constitution.",

      "abstract": "How much tradition is there in the avant-garde? Is everything that is claimed to be new really new? Literary Expressionism (the most important avant-garde movement of Classical Modernism), which was and still is generally considered to be the epoch of \"broken forms\", claimed this for itself: after all, artists had revolutionary experiences (such as the First World War) to deal with and often created something new. But not always, and so numerous sonnets can be found in poetry \u2013 and thus poems in a form from the 13th century. By showing (thanks to extensive source and archive studies) that this is a poetic mass phenomenon, however, Expressionism is now seen in a different light, revealing new facets in literature between 1905 and 1925. Case studies on the outstanding poets of early expressionism (Georg Heym and Georg Trakl), the period of the First World War (Max Herrmann-Neisse and Paul Zech) and the young Weimar Republic (Anton Schnack and Walter Rheiner) deepen this finding. In addition, the work is highly compatible both intermedially (music and visual arts) and comparatively (the sonnet as a European form of poetry) and also facilitates further literary studies thanks to an extensive appendix of sources.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the interwar breakdown of liberal democracy in the Weimar Republic. Hermann Heller used the term authoritarian liberalism to capture the conjunction of political authoritarianism and economic liberalism ruling late Weimar. This regime attempted to depoliticize conflict, specifically in the economic sector, which had been threatening the interests of capital. It was \u2018tolerated\u2019 by the social democrats, who gradually abandoned democratic projects over the course of the 1920s, leaving behind not only radical options such as democratization of the economy, but also the parliamentary institutions of the Weimar Republic. The chapter concludes by examining how the seizure of power by the Nazi party, although marking a break, in the sense of heralding a regime based on mass mobilization, national redemption, and a cult of violence, continued the trajectory of depoliticization, signalling the \u2018end of the political\u2019.",

      "abstract": "tive interpretation of the Fourth Republic, tracing its original weakness instead to a turbulent constitutional process, marked by the division and clashes of the first assembly, the failure to pass a first draft, and the urgent need to ratify a second one quickly. The analysis proposed in the chapters dedicated to France lay the groundwork for a reflection on Italy; it is easy to see the parallel with the French process, which took place in the fall of 1945 and thus before the Italian one. The authors of the Italian constitution were able to observe and learn from the French process, which became a reference point in terms of both the content and the dynamics at play. This was especially true of the unfortunate referendum result of the first draft, which prompted the Italians to adopt caution and a general proclivity for compromise \u2013 or at least for steering clear of unsolvable debates. Following these considerations, in his final chapters, the author chooses to focus on the role played by Togliatti\u2019s party during the constitutional process, comparing the strategies of Italian communists with those of the French. While the French Communist Party had \u2018stressed the importance of the \u201cmeans\u201d (a \u2018hyper-parliamentary\u2019 form of government) over the \u201cgoal\u201d (economic and social reforms), the Italian Communist Party\u2019s priority was the reverse\u2019 (p. 208). What transpires, then, is a reflection on the birth of the Italian, which emphasizes a prolonged period of traction with a generally united front, diametrically opposed in spirit to the urgency that animated the frantic drafting of the second version of the French constitution \u2013 later ratified through a referendum, giving birth to the Fourth Republic. This may appear to be a paradox, given France\u2019s long constitutional tradition, but only on the surface: as the author explains, it was precisely its strong ties to republican values that allowed members of the assembly \u2013 especially Communists \u2013 to firmly hold their ground with the risk, which did come about, of thwarting a possible compromise. At the same time, this led to the assembly giving up a broad declaration of human rights, at the cost of weakening the final draft; such a declaration was included in the original version and replaced in the final text by a more modest preamble that directly references the principles of the French Revolution. The resulting constitution was one ratified \u2018without enthusiasm\u2019, a very different outcome than in Italy, where the various political players worked together towards a deeply and broadly heartfelt goal: that the first breath of the new constitution to be loud and passionate, as a testament to its health, and as a commitment to the Republic\u2019s longevity.",

      "abstract": "In the German-speaking world, the memory of the Reformation has often been closely connected to the theory of German historical exceptionalism, the idea that Germany\u2019s historical development took a \u2018special path\u2019 (Sonderweg) to modernity. Yet considering how much attention has been paid to the question of a German Sonderweg and the significance of Weimar as a turning point in the story, scholars have paid little attention to the ideology of exceptionalism in the Weimar Republic itself. This article contributes to the historiography of the Sonderweg debate by examining the complex ways in which the poet Hugo Ball (1886-1927) and the philosopher Ernst Bloch (1885-1977) traced a narrative of German exceptionalism back to the Reformation era. It argues that these writers appealed to the intellectual and political legacies of the Reformation in an attempt to explain the formative events of their own time: the First World War, and the Russian and German Revolutions. The divergent ideological conclusions they drew reveals much about the conflicted atmosphere of Weimar thought, in which German intellectuals struggled to bridge the gap between crisis and tradition.",

The future world is heading into the age of artificial intelligence (AI), and data would be the most valuable asset for human society [4]. In terms of real-time, all-elements (a simultaneous analysis feature of LIBS), in addition to the suitability for solid, liquid, and gas analysis, plus remote sensing, LIBS, to some extent, is a back-window in exploring and improving our world by easily providing a tremendous amount of elemental spectral big-data and is able to increasingly contribute more with technological and societal development. That is, LIBS may play a more important role than we expect depending on the quantification performance of LIBS. The higher the performance, the more important the technology to future human society. In 2000, the 1st International Conference of LIBS was held in Pisa, Italy, symbolizing the coming of high-speed development for LIBS. The great potential of LIBS attracted Asian researchers as well. The 1st Chinese Symposium on LIBS (CSLIBS 2011), hosted in Qingdao, and the 8th International Symposium on LIBS (LIBS 2014), held in Beijing, greatly stimulated the establishment of the Asian LIBS community and Asian Symposium on LIBS (ASLIBS). In 2015, the 1st Asian Symposium on LIBS was hosted in Wuhan, marking the birth of the Asian LIBS community. With the rapid development of the Asian LIBS community, we have successfully become one of the three major LIBS communities in the world. From the beginning of the ASLIBS meeting, it has become a tradition to publish a special issue to witness the development of the Asian LIBS community and technology [5, 6]. Plasma Science and Technology started the connection with ASLIBS2017 which was held in Tokushima, Japan [6]. The present issue collected 15 articles for the 3rd Asian Symposium of LIBS (ASLIBS2019) which was held in Jeju, Republic of Korea. These articles, together with other reports in the ASLIBS2019, provide a picture of the current research interests from the Asian LIBS community. The work published in this collection was summarized as below: There are four articles on LIBS fundamentals. Two articles investigated the fundamentals of underwater LIBS, one studied the water pressure effects on LIBS [7] and the other studied the water temperature effects [8]. The other two articles on fundamentals investigated the influence of target temperature on LIBS [9] and the plasma evolution of hydrogen retention in tantalum [10], respectively. In this issue, an introduction work of a mobile prototype fiber-optic LIBS (FO-LIBS) is included [11]. This prototype was applied to rapidly online analyze the trace elements in large diameter steel tube. Results demonstrated that the performance of this mobile FO-LIBS prototype can be compared with conventional LIBS systems. In addition, there are ten articles regarding data processing and different applications. A series of different new data processing methods were proposed, such as variable selection [12\u201314], principal component analysis Mahalanobis distance [15], combination of support vector machine and partial least square [16], as well as the classification method based on the elemental intensity ratio [17].

By focusing on the roles played by the translators, legislators, and interpreters, this paper discusses how the social rights created by the WRV were translated into the fundamental policy of the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China. More- over, regarding \u00bbpolicy\u00ab as the legal instrument for regulating the social-economic life, and even broader \ufb01elds, it triggers the modern transforma- tion of Chinese meritocracy and reinforces the national legal tradition depicted in its modern form.

      "abstract": "Abstract Veneration of Westphalian stigmatic and visionary Anna Katharina Emmerick (1774\u20131824) reached new heights during the Weimar Republic. German Catholics engaged in promoting her beatification cause organized a multipronged, multimedia campaign. Priests and laypersons, as well as the popular press and theological journals, all encouraged the veneration of Emmerick as \u201ca crucified saint for a crucified Volk.\u201d Memories of Napoleonic French aggression, secularization, and waning religious belief provided revanchist Weimar German Catholics with a readymade narrative of victimization. Moreover, as a poster child of the Westphalian Heimat, her pilgrimage sites offered a spiritual antidote to the \u201cgodless\u201d modern city. Meanwhile, everyday Catholics continued a century-old, locally-based tradition of veneration that did not strictly conform to the new \u201cofficial\u201d line. Emmerick's Weimar cult, and the modern saint-making process more generally, thus provide a window onto the push and pull between clergy and laity, men and women, institutional and popular forces, in shaping lived German Catholicism in the 1920s. Die Verehrung der stigmatisierten und seherischen Anna Katharina Emmerick (1774\u20131824) aus Westfalen erreichte w\u00e4hrend der Weimarer Republik einen neuen H\u00f6hepunkt. Die deutschen Katholiken setzten sich f\u00fcr ihre Seligsprechung ein, indem sie eine mehrgleisige Multimediakampagne organisierten. Geistliche und Laien sowie die Boulevardpresse und theologische Zeitschriften ermutigten allesamt zur Verehrung der Emmerick als \u201eeiner gekreuzigten Heiligen f\u00fcr ein gekreuzigtes Volk.\u201d Die Erinnerungen an die napoleonischen Kriege, die S\u00e4kularisierung und der abflauende Religionsglaube stellten dabei f\u00fcr die revanchistischen deutschen Katholiken Weimars eine gebrauchsfertige Opfergeschichte dar. Au\u00dferdem boten Emmericks Pilgerorte als ein Aush\u00e4ngeschild f\u00fcr ihre westf\u00e4lische Heimat ein spirituelles Gegenmittel zur \u201egottlosen\u201d modernen Stadt. Gleichzeitig f\u00fchrten die Durchschnittskatholiken eine Jahrhunderte alte, lokale Tradition der Verehrung fort, die nicht konform zur neuen \u201eoffiziellen\u201d Richtung verlief. Der Weimarer Emmerick Kult und der moderne Prozess einer \u201eHeiligmachung\u201d im Allgemeinen bieten somit einen Einblick in das Hin und Her zwischen Geistlichen und Laien, M\u00e4nnern und Frauen sowie institutionellen und popul\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4ften\u2014und damit den gelebten Katholizismus im Deutschland der 1920er Jahre.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The article explores the key components of the political project of West Germany and the role of the Rechtsstaat within it. It shows how the German Federal Republic developed a specific reading of the rule of law as an order founded on basic rights as supra-legal values and judicial authority, which had to be defended even against democratic government. This did not signify a departure from the constitutional theory of the Weimar period, as constitutional lawyers such as Gustav Radbruch and Carlo Schmid claimed at the time. Instead, the decisive innovations in constitutional thought stemmed from the Weimar era. Judicial review and basic rights had been instruments in a political and legal struggle over the social question and the boundaries of democratic decision-making in the 1920s. They had been invoked by conservative lawyers such as Carl Schmitt and been the subject of a substantial critique mounted by social democrat interpreters of the Weimar Constitution such as Hermann Heller and Franz Neumann. As such the Rechtsstaat, which is so strongly associated with the renewal of German democracy, carries with it a tradition of legal thought which systematically and successfully expanded judicial power to the detriment of the legislature and democratic action.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The abundant \u2018cabaret\u2019 events that populate London\u2019s contemporary entertainment scene strategically adopt specific structures and aesthetics. Common points of reference include the Weimar Republic, Berlin clubs of the 1920\u2019s, \u2018salacious\u2019 female nudity, \u2018outrageous\u2019 camp reveals and inevitable references to Bob Fosse\u2019s \u2018Cabaret\u2019. The events often promise to provide a \u2018high quality\u2019 drinking and dining experience. In this way \u2018nostalgia\u2019 can be turned into financial success. This formulaic approach defines the contemporary understanding of cabaret, omitting vital aspects of the genre while turning it into a purely commercial commodity. My artistic practice as research interrogates the experimental nature of the cabaret of late nineteenth century Paris within a contemporary British context. Setting itself apart from the allure of \u2018flesh and cash\u2019 of the West End cabaret, Ms. Paolini\u2019s Phantasmagoria Cabaret, regularly programmed at Hoxton Hall, London, since 2016, focuses on exploring an updated experience of European cabaret within the abandoned British Music Hall and Variety tradition. The wider cultural discourse fails to report on the possibility of different approaches to cabaret. I will draw on particular examples from my practice \u2013 how a 60-something performer clad in Y-fronts, for example, was regarded by a certain audience as obscene \u2013 to explore the subtleties of contemporary censorship and what it says about our cultural landscape. The \u2018body reveal\u2019 \u2013 one of the commercial selling points of West End cabaret replica productions \u2013 becomes unacceptable in the different context of Ms. Paolini\u2019s Phantasmagoria Cabaret. This article examines how censorship operates in relation to contemporary experimental cabaret, providing an alternative account of the contemporary development of traditional cabaret and suggesting that there are different angles from which to approach discussion of the genre.",

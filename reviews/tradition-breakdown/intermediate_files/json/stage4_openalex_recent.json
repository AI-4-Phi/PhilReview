      "abstract": "This article lays out a general thesis for the development of a comparative ethnographic approach to the anthropology of wonder. It suggests that wonder is both an index and a mode of challenge to existing ontological premises. Through analytical engagement with the theme of wonder in Western philosophy and the anthropology of ontology, it extends this thesis to include the corollary that different ontological premises give rise to different wonders. Ethnographically, the article supports these claims via analysis of wonder discourses among the Arosi of Solomon Islands. These discourses, it is argued, both respond to and promote ontological transformations in a context where the premises at stake are neither those of the Cartesian dualism commonly ascribed to modernity nor of the relational non-dualism commonly ascribe to anthropology's ethnographic 'others', but of a non-Cartesian pluralism termed poly-ontology. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Le pr\u00e9sent article expose une th\u00e8se g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour l'\u00e9laboration d'une approche ethnographique comparative de l'ethnologie de l'\u00e9merveillement. Il sugg\u00e8re que l'\u00e9merveillement est \u00e0 la fois un indicateur des pr\u00e9suppos\u00e9s ontologiques existants et un moyen de les remettre en question. A partir d'un dialogue analytique avec le th\u00e8me de l'\u00e9merveillement dans la philosophie occidentale ainsi que l'anthropologie de l'ontologie, il \u00e9largit cette th\u00e8se pour y inclure la corollaire que des pr\u00e9misses ontologiques diff\u00e9rentes donnent naissance \u00e0 des \u00e9merveillements diff\u00e9rents. Du point de vue ethnographique, cet article \u00e9taie ces affirmations par l'analyse des discours de l'\u00e9merveillement chez les Arosi des \u00eeles Salomon. Il avance que ces discours r\u00e9pondent aux transformations ontologiques tout en les favorisant, dans un contexte o\u00f9 les pr\u00e9misses en jeu ne sont ni celles du dualisme cart\u00e9sien habituellement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la modernit\u00e9, ni celles du non-dualisme habituellement assign\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00ab l'autre \u00bb ethnographique de l'anthropologie, mais celles d'un pluralisme non cart\u00e9sien que l'on peut appeler poly-ontologie. Mr Parrot (Mwane Kira) and Mr Octopus (Mwane 'Uria) lived in our island, Makira. One day these two friends agreed, 'Let's try to hide [from each other]'. Mr Parrot is a bird that lives in the bush; it's a bird whose colour is beautifully green. Mr Octopus lives in the sea and has eight tentacles. Mr Parrot said, 'You hide first. I'll look for you'. So, Mr Octopus went and stayed on top of a rock. He changed and looked like that rock. And Mr Parrot said, 'I can see you down there on top of that rock. I can see you very well'. 'I'll go again!' Mr. Octopus went and stayed on top of another rock and changed to look like that rock. And Mr Parrot said, 'You're down there on top of that rock. I can see you!' At that point Mr Octopus became a little angry and thought, 'Goodness, how can I hide from Mr Parrot? This time I'll go down and try to hide really well'. Mr Octopus went down into the sea and went under a stone. He changed and looked like that stone. And Mr Parrot said, 'It's you under that stone and you've changed to look like that stone!' Mr Octopus gave up and said, 'You hide as well'. Mr Parrot went and flew up into a tree and cried out, 'Can you see me?' Mr Octopus looked and looked, but he couldn't see him. He kept looking and looking, but no! And as Mr Octopus kept looking, his eyes stuck out a little. So, Mr Parrot won and Mr Octopus lost. And today, if you see Mr Octopus, you'll see his two eyes sticking out, and if you come across Mr Parrot singing in a tree, you'll hear him but you won't be able to see him. This is my edited translation of a story I heard in 2006 during an eight-month field stay among the Arosi of Solomon Islands. The Arosi are a population of around 9,400 Austronesian-speaking Melanesians whose home region, also called Arosi, lies at the northwest end of the island of Makira. Makira (formerly San Cristobal) is the southernmost large island in the Solomons chain, about 2,000 kilometres northeast of Australia. A British protectorate from 1893, Solomon Islands became an independent nation-state in 1978. They called it [the island] after the character of Mr Parrot. If a person hides over here, we people of Makira would still see him. Whether just by knowledge, or because you left something that no one knows about, we poor little people, who look like we are covered in dust, will still see you. It is their character; they are like Mr Parrot \u2026 Look, it isn't as if this is just about us Arosi; the whole island has this character. We look like poor unimportant people, just pitiful \u2013 or we act like that \u2013 but our knowledge is so special. This island has the name Makira. It means that this island has an eye like the bird called kira, the singing parrot. It can look and see things that are hidden or whatever is secret. It can see them and know, or it has a feeling and can hear whether things are or aren't true. These interpretations of Mr Parrot are examples of what I call 'wonder discourses'. With this concept, I aggregate discursive practices that meet one or both of two criteria. First, a discursive practice is a wonder discourse if it is evidence of a heightened interest in or mood of wonder in a given context. Second, a discursive practice is a wonder discourse if people engage in it as a way of cultivating wonder. Wonder discourses are therefore analytically distinct from myths or folktales that tell of extraordinary beings and events, although \u2013 as in the case of Mr Parrot \u2013 they may reference such stories (cf. Lattas 2010: xxi). Among Arosi, as I will explain, wonder discourses are both expressions of and contributors to a heightened mood of wonder about Makira itself. Since my doctoral research in 1992 to 1993, Arosi have elaborated an extensive repertoire of discourses about Makira that suggest the island constitutes and conceals a marvellous power, or mena (the Arosi variant of Oceanic mana), in which they and all things autochthonous (auhenua) to Makira participate. In their own terms, Arosi sometimes describe whatever seems to hint at or disclose this hidden power as a ha'abu'oahu, 'something amazing', 'a miracle', 'a wonder'; some even use the English word 'wonder'. My most encompassing agenda in this article is to bring my analysis of Makiran wonder discourses into dialogue with Western philosophy and the anthropology of ontology to offer a general thesis for the development of an anthropology of wonder. The thesis I propose is that wonder \u2013 broadly construed to include awe, marvel, astonishment, shock, dread, amazement, and horror (cf. Rubenstein 2008: 9) \u2013 is an index and a mode of challenge to existing ontological premises. Wherever there is wonder, there has been a destabilization, whether fleeting or prolonged, of specific assumptions about the nature of being or becoming. But wonder is not only a spontaneous response to such destabilization; it is also a mood that can be created and sustained as a way of contesting received ontological limits and reconfiguring ontological possibilities. In what follows, I explore how the mood expressed and generated by Makiran wonder discourses is an index and a mode of challenge to the received ontological premises of Arosi cosmology. According to these premises, socio-cosmic order is an aggregate of independently arising, territorially specific, and matrilineally sustained categories of being. Today, however, as processes of ethnogenesis in Solomon Islands harden insular and regional identities, images of Makira as a whole, and of Makirans as a single island-specific category, can appear to Arosi as intimations of something amazingly at odds with their ancestral precedents: maybe the lineage-cum-land entities of Makira coexist in continuity rather than discontinuity of being. As the eschatological content of some Makiran wonder discourses suggests, this possibility is disquieting as well as exhilarating. It promises empowerment vis-\u00e0-vis other incipient infra-national groups, but dooms Makirans to incestuous confusion. I begin by situating my thesis within Western thinking about wonder and highlighting how aspects of this tradition illustrate what the thesis contends. This establishes a comparative framework for an ethnographic approach to the nexus between wonder and ontology. Set within this framework, my ethnography offers an account of what generates wonder when the ontological premises at stake are those of neither the Cartesian dualism commonly said to define moderns nor the relational non-dualism commonly imputed to anthropological 'others'. The history of Western thought provides strong precedents for the thesis forwarded here and also offers instances of philosophical, poetic, and anthropological practices that support its claims. In The passions of the soul, for example, Ren\u00e9 Descartes wrote: 'When the first encounter with some object surprises us, and we judge it to be new, or very different from what we knew in the past or what we supposed it was going to be, this makes us wonder and be astonished at it' (1989 [1649]: 52). This account clearly identifies difference, or unknown otherness, as that which evokes wonder. For this reason, it has been a touchstone for critical thinkers who wish to link wonder and alterity in their cultural histories or ethics (e.g. Greenblatt 1991; Irigaray 2004). But, if wonder arises from some inkling of novelty or difference, this raises the question, novelty or difference in relation to what (cf. La Caze 2013: 14)? It is only relative to expectations conditioned by some sense of what there is and of what is possible that something can provoke wonder. Wonder is inextricably linked not only to alterity but also to people's ontological premises, and, indeed, demonstrates the existence of such premises, however we theorize them (as evolved, acquired, or configured by interplays between the two, etc.). Recognition of this nexus between wonder and challenge to ontological premises is most apparent in the writings of philosophers who focus on wonder as a response to that which is not merely new or different but inexplicable. The inexplicable, they emphasize, casts seemingly unquestionable axioms about the way things are into radical doubt and suggests new realities. Playing on the possible etymological relationship between English 'wonder' and 'wound', philosopher of religion Mary-Jane Rubenstein observes that wonder responds to 'a destabilizing and unassimilable interruption in the ordinary course of things, an uncanny opening, rift, or wound in the everyday' (2008: 10). Or, as Jerome Miller puts it, wonder arises from experiences that 'are charged with ontological significance', because they 'transform our knowledge of what is by awakening us to realities of which we would otherwise be oblivious' (1992: xii). Exploiting this capacity of wonder to awaken us to new realities, diverse Western thinkers have sought to induce wonder in order to question the seemingly self-evident and explore previously unimagined possibilities. This was how Socrates operated. By posing questions that forced his interlocutors to contradict what they took for granted, he led them into aporia, a state of dizzying perplexity in which they became 'lost in wonder' (Rubenstein 2008: 3; cf. Kofman 1988: 19). He fostered wonder with intent to undermine everyday precepts and open apertures onto the unknown as a spur to inquiry after 'the highest things' (Green 2004: 45). 'Greece never existed', wrote Andr\u00e9 Breton in a 1948 poem entitled 'Rano Raraku', after a volcanic hill on Rapanui (Easter Island) noted for its moai statues (in Debaene 2014: 255). With this line, Breton obliterated the idealization of classical antiquity and asserted the radical alterity of the moai and their cultic milieu. Yet Breton's agenda for Surrealism hinged on wonder in ways that link him back to Greece and to Socratic Method. Whereas Socrates generated wonder through logical contradictions, Breton induced it through the poetic juxtaposition of incongruous images: through verbal metaphors, chance encounters, the random finding of objects shorn from their original contexts, and the assembling of artefacts from afar (cf. Edwards 2008: 192-6). He pursued 'the marvelous [le merveilleux], with all it implies in terms of surprise, splendor, and dazzling outlook' because the outlook it offers is 'onto something other than what we are able to know' (Breton 1995: 173). Socrates professed abiding ignorance about 'the highest things', yet arguably his unwillingness to prescribe alternatives to the ontological premises he challenged promoted wonder itself as 'conducive to engendering good individuals and a good city' (Green 2004: 64). In contrast, Breton aimed to realize the 'something other' to which he said wonder gives access. He enjoined surrealists to provoke wonder so that 'the poetic (surrealist) vision of things' might 'account for the interpenetration of mind and matter' and 'overcome the dualism of perception and representation' characteristic of 'the realist vision' (Breton 1995: 171-2). For both thinkers, wonder was a practice with the potential to transform ontological premises as social and political change. Data supportive of the thesis I am proposing for an anthropology of wonder come also from several of the discourses now constituting the anthropology of ontology.1 Among these, it is possible to discern more than one agenda for anthropology that implicitly renders it a wonder practice capable of de-centring the ontological premises ascribed to moderns by grappling with the ontological premises ascribed to others (e.g. Evens 2008: 223, 294; Ingold 2011: 74-5; Rose 2011: 5-6). Such an agenda is legible, for example, in the work of Martin Holbraad, a leading voice in the Cambridge-originated 'ontological turn'. Referencing Socrates, Holbraad (2012: 246) advocates a 'recursive anthropology' in which the provocation of 'ethnographically driven aporia' (2012: 263) is pivotal. Holbraad argues that a distinguishing feature of anthropology has been, and ought to remain, its concern with alterity, but alterity defined in specific terms. Alterity, according to Holbraad, is that which cannot be represented without recourse to logical contradictions and oxymoronic formulations: 'Things that are also people, people that are also gods, gods that are also wafers, twins that are also birds' (2012: xvi). Alterity, in other words, is precisely that which challenges a cardinal ontological premise of realist rationalism: the law of non-contradiction according to which a thing cannot be both itself and something else at the same time. Holbraad's claim is that this kind of alterity, like the contradictions elicited by Socratic questioning, leads anthropologists into the conceptual and verbal impasse of aporia. And for Holbraad, as for Socrates, this is the necessary condition for the birthing of new insights. Holbraad (along with his co-authors) recommends therefore that, whenever alterity causes anthropologists to marvel (cf. Holbraad, Pedersen & Viveiros de Castro 2014), they should resist the inclination to explain that alterity away as indicative of ignorance, madness, or metaphor. Holding on to their 'wonderment' (Henare, Holbraad & Wastell 2007: 1), they should allow alterity, recursively, to prompt them to generate new concepts that might destabilize the premises of realist rationalism. 'Immanent' to this recursive anthropology, moreover, is 'the politics of indefinitely sustaining the possible, the \"could be\"' (Holbraad et al. 2014). In keeping with my own comparative approach to ontology, however, the anthropology of wonder I seek to develop values the recursive power of the anthropologist's wonder, but extends also to an ethnographic focus on what constitutes a wonder to others. What is it that provokes wonder in others, and how might their experiences of wonder, and their wonder practices, be indices or modes of challenge to the ontological premises relevant to them? It is always possible (probable?) that one's field interlocutors will presuppose realist rationalism, at least in some contexts, and will express or promote wonder at that which challenges its ontological premises. But it is also possible that they will, either additionally or instead, be the recipients and generators of worlds other than the world of realist rationalism \u2013 worlds configured by other ontological premises, entailing other criteria for what makes a wonder. That which prompts the ethnographer's wonder may not, therefore, astonish the people he or she meets in the field, and vice versa. Likewise, something may appear wonderful to different people \u2013 or to the same person \u2013 by reason of different onto-logics. Again, Holbraad's theorization of alterity aids explication, as it implies just such a model of diverse, ontologically conditioned wonders. His ethnography yields the inference that, for the people who cause alterity to appear to anthropologists, that alterity is no alterity at all and, hence, no source of wonder. By his account, for example, the capacity of ritual specialists in Cuban If\u00e1 divination 'to bring Orula into during divination no sense of nor is it the object of the of the might be to for a continuity of being between two ontologically (2012: This is he the ontological premises of If\u00e1 are If\u00e1 neither a of entities nor an of being but a of (2012: in which is and there are no the to from 'the relative ontological of to the relative of (2012: but not among If\u00e1 What however, although Holbraad not it, is the that the relational premises of If\u00e1 their own criteria for alterity and, for what would If\u00e1 as It may now be in as a corollary to the thesis that wonder is an index and a mode of challenge to existing ontological premises, that different ontological premises give rise to different in both of the different and and different of wonder. This corollary a comparative approach to wonder as an of the anthropology of ontology (cf. wonder may not be wonder, this approach not begin with an but by to expressions of wonder during and what wonder arises from and what it It that the ethnographer's of what wonder like will not what his or field interlocutors yet that in order to allow and to (cf.

      "abstract": "1. Mixed methods as a methodological approachMixed and multi-method research have a long history in both science and social science field research (Maxwell 2015) and in evaluation (Rallis and Rossman 2003), but the adoption of mixed methods research more widely and its establishment as a distinct methodological tradition across the behavioural and social sciences is more recent (Johnson and Gray 2010). Since the turn of the century, adoption in some fields within health and education has been rapid and widespread, but those working in psychology and management appear to have been somewhat more reticent in their adoption of mixed approaches (Molina Azorin 2011; Molina Azorin and Cameron 2015; van der Roest, Spaaij and van Bottenburg 2015). The desire to appear 'scientific' in one's methods, and differences in ontology, epistemology, and in disciplinary traditions have hindered the willingness of some to engage with what appears to be a compromise (and paradigmatically compromised) position. Management researchers seeking to use a mixed methods approach can meet with resistance from the gatekeepers of a discipline in which research, if not practice, is heavily imbued with a positivist philosophy, a love of indices, and an expectation of elaborate statistical analyses of numeric data (Currall and Towler 2003). Molina Azorin and Cameron (2015) cite several sources of evidence to suggest, however, that perhaps business scholars are using mixed methods research to a greater extent than appears from counts of identified as mixed methods articles, with journal editors being partly to blame for lack of openness about having included some qualitative methods during an investigation that was eventually published as an ostensibly quantitative research article.The obligation to be open to use of mixed methods is predicated on the need to find the most appropriate methodology and method(s) to meet the purpose of any specific research project, and to answer its questions. Most social science researchers using mixed methods claim they do so to add strength to their argument (Johnson, Onwuegbuzie and Turner 2007). It is of interest, for example, that more than half of the exemplary studies in organization science explored by Frost and Stablein (1992) employed multiple or mixed methods (resulting in almost universal experiences for their authors of difficulty in having their work accepted for publication). In their recently published paper, Molina-Azorin and Cameron (2015) outlined four ways in which using mixed methods can benefit business research: preliminary qualitative data can provide a deeper understanding of context to inform context-specific in strategic management and entrepreneurship; attention to both process and outcome through mixed methods benefit theory-building, for example with qualitative methods contributing insights as to the mechanisms through which different variables contribute to a measured outcome; study of complex organizations would benefit from analyses that are integrated across micro and macro levels; and use of mixed methods helps to bridge the academic-practitioner divide through enhancing the interpretation and communication of results. A higher level of citations for mixed than monomethod articles from the same journals was reported also by these authors (based on an earlier study by Molina Azorin 2011) as evidence of the benefits gained.After declaring mixed methods to constitute a third methodological movement (Johnson and Onwuegbuzie 2004) and in an attempt to achieve consensus about the focus of this rapidly evolving movement, Johnson, Onwuegbuzie and Turner (2007) reviewed 19 definitions of mixed methods contributed by then leaders in the field, to arrive at the following composite definition:Mixed methods research is the type of research in which a researcher or team of researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches (e. \u2026",

      "abstract": "Introduction As a research methodology, phenomenology is uniquely positioned to help health professions education (HPE) scholars learn from the experiences of others. Phenomenology is a form of qualitative research that focuses on the study of an individual\u2019s lived experiences within the world. Although it is a powerful approach for inquiry, the nature of this methodology is often intimidating to HPE researchers. This article aims to explain phenomenology by reviewing the key philosophical and methodological differences between two of the major approaches to phenomenology: transcendental and hermeneutic. Understanding the ontological and epistemological assumptions underpinning these approaches is essential for successfully conducting phenomenological research. Purpose This review provides an introduction to phenomenology and demonstrates how it can be applied to HPE research. We illustrate the two main sub-types of phenomenology and detail their ontological, epistemological, and methodological differences. Conclusions Phenomenology is a powerful research strategy that is well suited for exploring challenging problems in HPE. By building a better understanding of the nature of phenomenology and working to ensure proper alignment between the specific research question and the researcher\u2019s underlying philosophy, we hope to encourage HPE scholars to consider its utility when addressing their research questions.",

      "abstract": "The concept of research paradigm is one that many higher degree research students, and even early career researchers, find elusive to articulate, and challenging to apply in their research proposals. Adopting an ethnographic and hermeneutic methodology, the present paper draws upon our experiences as lecturers in Research Methods over many years, and upon pertinent literature to explain the meaning of research paradigm. The paper elucidates the key aspects of research paradigms that researchers should understand well to be able to address this concept adequately in their research proposals. It offers suggestions on how researchers can locate their research into a paradigm and the justification needed for paradigm choice. With the explicit purpose of helping higher degree research (HDR) students design effective research proposals, the paper also discusses the different research methodologies best suited to conduct research in each of the paradigms discussed.",

Motivated by the siloed nature of much poverty research, as well as the challenge of finding inclusive operational definitions of poverty, this study reflects on the merits of seeking to reconcile economic (quantitative) and anthropological (qualitative) analytical approaches. Drawing on detailed evidence from Mozambique, we highlight fundamental philosophical tensions in poverty research along three main axes: social ontology (what is the form of social reality?); (b) epistemology (what can be known about poverty?); and (c) aetiology (how is poverty produced?). We argue the quantitative tradition is rooted in an atomistic view of the social world, which is allied to an etic epistemology in which causes and effects are treated as analytically separable. Anthropological work in Mozambique is anchored in an emic perspective, where the diverse forms of poverty are revealed through investigation of their generative mechanisms. This provides a view of poverty as a relational process of social marginalization and directs attention to the diversity of lived-experiences, as well as structural factors that limit individuals' agency. In clarifying their distinct philosophical commitments, we contend that a forced empirical marriage of the two approaches may be unhelpful. Instead, we recommend the virtues of each approach are leveraged toward genuine mutual dialogue.",

To move the field forward, this article develops a set of fundamental premises that reconcile contradictions in research on customer experience and provide integrative guideposts for future research. A systematic review of 136 articles identifies eight literature fields that address customer experience. The article then compares the phenomena and metatheoretical assumptions prevalent in each field to establish a dual classification of research traditions that study customer experience as responses to either (1) managerial stimuli or (2) consumption processes. By analyzing the compatibility of these research traditions through a metatheoretical lens, this investigation derives four fundamental premises of customer experience that are generalizable across settings and contexts. These premises advance the conceptual development of customer experience by defining its core conceptual domain and providing guidelines for further research.",

Their studies on such a case mostly concern with ontological-philological text analysis not directly related with the religious tradition and socio-culture which is more dynamic and realistic. This study employs social definition paradigm and phenomenological theory approach limited to the dialectic pattern between religion and myth in the ritual selamatan of Javanese wedding. The data were collected though interviewing and observing religious leaders, ethnic leaders, and Muslim preacher in Ngajum, Malang. The study found two models of dialectic pattern namely theological-compromistic and theological-humanistic. The earlier describes the theological shift from emotional-naturalistic to rational-formalistic. The later describes the theological shift from personal to social awareness theology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telaah empirik seputar pola dialektika antara agama dan budaya dalam kasus ritual selamatan pernikahan adat Jawa, belum banyak dilakukan oleh para pakar agama, ilmuan sosial, maupun ilmuan antropolog agama. Kajian mereka terhadap kasus ini pada umumnya masih menekankan pada objek pembacaan teks secara ontologis-filologis, yang tidak bersinggungan secara langsung terhadap tradisi keagamaan dan budaya masyarakat yang lebih dinamis dan realistis. Penelitian ini menggunakan paradigma definisi sosial dan pendekatan teori fenomenologis, yang dibatasi pada pola dialektika antara agama dan mitos dalam kasus ritual selamatan pernikahan adat Jawa. Data diperoleh dengan cara menginterview dan mengobservasi para tokoh agama, tokoh adat, dan para da\u2019i yang ada di Ngajum, Malang. Penelitian ini menemukan dua model yaitu pola dialektika teologis-kompromistik dan pola dialektika teologis-humanistik. Pola dialektika pertama, menggambarkan pergeseran teologis, dari teologi yang bersifat emosional-naturalistik menuju teologi yang bersifat rasional-formalistik. Adapun pola teologis-humanistik menggambarkan adanya pergeseran teologi yang bersifat personal menuju teologi yang berkesadaran sosial.&lt;/p&gt;",

This text argues that the discipline\u2019s engagement with alterities that dispute our ontological secular conceptions makes evident its form of knowledge production. The central claim is that anthropology\u2019s secularity is not fixed and should be discussed as part of a historical process. I propose to analyse two modalities of secularity, which I term \u2018extinction\u2019 and \u2018captivity\u2019. A second claim is that despite their differences, both modalities (re)produce to its academic and Euro-American audience anthropology\u2019s own secularity as a natural human condition. A third claim is that by recognising the characteristics of our discipline\u2019s secularity we may start to speak of a plurality of secular ontologies as a way to register the multiplicity of \u2018worldliness\u2019 that traditions and individuals may assume or call for.",

Several studies suggest that they might have an impact, but the topic of RPGs and well-being is usually only mentioned as a side note or curiosity.

I ask the questions: What can we learn from the already existing research? How should RPGs and well-being be studied? What questions need resolving? What can be gained from studying RPGs and well-being?&#x0D; RPG studies is a young academic interdisciplinary field of research, as is also the research of arts and well-being. They both are heterogeneous and related to a variety of academic traditions. They both are also dispersed, pragmatic, and until recently, scattered and lacking cohesive traditions or methodologies. Many basic ontological questions remain unsolved and the definitions of key concepts vary. They overlap in several discourses, such as the ones about (1) practices of sociodrama and replication therapy; (2) social, cultural, and digital capital; (3) leisure time research; (4) performance studies; (5) the topic of erotic role-play; (6) problematic vs. therapeutic gaming; and (7) health education. Previous research and practices focus mainly on live action role play (larp) and well-being, suggesting a positive impact. Online RPGs share their own traditions, but studies on tabletop RPGs and well-being are difficult to find. The studies are often case-studies or examine abstract topics such as human experiences.&#x0D; In these studies, it becomes evident that RPGs do indeed impact well-being. However, questions such as how, why, and what features in RPGs affect well-being remain unanswered. In addition, the research has mainly been executed from the perspective of either RPGs or arts and well-being. Interdisciplinary cooperation is the key to successfully diving into the world of RPGs and well-being. Doing so would offer both fields useful practices, interesting perspectives, new opportunities for publication and academic discussion. It would not only add knowledge about RPGs and well-being but offer perspective to the unresolved ontological questions of each field. Eventually, further study on RPGs and well-being could transfer into the usage of RPGs in the fields of well-being, health, and therapy in a similar manner that arts are currently being used.",

      "abstract": "Notions such as wellbeing, freedom, and social justice are integral to evaluating social progress and developing policies. One increasingly influential way to think about these concepts is the capability approach, a theoretical framework which was pioneered by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s. In this book Ingrid Robeyns orientates readers new to the capability approach through offering an explanation of this framework. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice also endeavors to resolve historical disputes in the literature and thus will be equally engaging to those familiar with the field. The author offers a novel and illuminating account of how the capability approach can be understood in a variety of academic disciplines and fields of application. Special attention is paid to clarifying misunderstandings that have been caused by different disciplinary assumptions and the interpretive consequences they have for our consideration of the capability approach. Robeyns argues that respecting the distinction between the general capability approach, and more specific capability theories or applications, helps to clear up confusion and misinterpretation. In addition, the author presents detailed analyses of well-known objections to the capability approach, and also discusses how it relates to other schools of analysis such as theories of justice, human rights, basic needs, and the human development approach. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice offers an original and comprehensive account of the field. The book will appeal to scholars of the capability approach as well as new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduction.",

Even if, for most of us, especially those in parts of the world where health care systems have been devastated by years of organized neglect, the worst is yet to come. With no hospital beds, no respirators, no mass testing, no masks nor disinfectants nor arrangements for placing those who are infected in quarantine, unfortunately, many will not pass through the eye of the needle.1It is one thing to worry about the death of others in a distant land and quite another to suddenly become aware of one\u2019s own putrescence, to be forced to live intimately with one\u2019s own death, contemplating it as a real possibility. Such is, for many, the terror triggered by confinement: having to finally answer for one\u2019s own life, to one\u2019s own name. We must answer here and now for our life on Earth with others (including viruses) and our shared fate. Such is the injunction this pathogenic period addresses to humankind. It is pathogenic but also the catabolic period par excellence, with the decomposition of bodies, the sorting and expulsion of all sorts of human waste\u2014the \u201cgreat separation\u201d and great confinement caused by the stunning spread of the virus\u2014and along with it, the widespread digitization of the world.Try as we might to rid ourselves of it, in the end everything brings us back to the body. We tried to graft it onto other media, to turn it into an object body, a machine body, a digital body, an ontophanic body. It returns to us now as a horrifying, giant mandible, a vehicle for contamination, a vector for pollen, spores, and mold. Knowing that we do not face this ordeal alone, that many will not escape it, is vain comfort. For we have never learned to live with all living species, have never really worried about the damage we as humans wreak on the lungs of the Earth and on its body. Thus, we have never learned how to die. With the advent of the New World and, several centuries later, the appearance of the \u201cindustrialized races,\u201d we essentially chose to delegate our death to others, to make a great sacrificial repast of existence itself via a kind of ontological vicariate.Soon, it will no longer be possible to delegate one\u2019s death to others. It will no longer be possible for that person to die in our place. Not only will we be condemned to assume our own demise, unmediated, but farewells will be few and far between. The hour of autophagy is upon us and, with it, the death of community, as there is no community worthy of its name in which saying one\u2019s last farewell, that is, remembering the living at the moment of death, becomes impossible. Community\u2014or rather the in-common\u2014is not based solely on the possibility of saying goodbye, that is, of having a unique encounter with others and honoring this meeting time and again. The in-common is based also on the possibility of sharing unconditionally, each time drawing from it something absolutely intrinsic, a thing uncountable, incalculable, priceless.2There is no doubt that the skies are closing in. Caught in the stranglehold of injustice and inequality, much of humanity is threatened by a great chokehold as the sense that our world is in a state of reprieve spreads far and wide. If, in these circumstances, a day after comes, it cannot come at the expense of some, always the same ones, as in the Ancienne \u00c9conomie\u2014the economy that preceded this revolution. It must necessarily be a day for all the inhabitants of Earth, without distinction as to species, race, sex, citizenship, religion, or other differentiating marker. In other words, a day after will come but only with a giant rupture, the result of radical imagination.Papering over the cracks simply won\u2019t do. Deep in the heart of this crater, literally everything must be reinvented, starting with the social. Once working, shopping, keeping up with the news and keeping in touch, nurturing and preserving connections, talking to one another and sharing, drinking together, worshipping and organizing funerals begins to take place solely across the interface of screens, it is time to acknowledge that on all sides we are surrounded by rings of fire. To a great extent, the digital is the new gaping hole exploding Earth. Simultaneously a trench, a tunnel, a moonscape, it is the bunker where men and women are all invited to hide away, in isolation.They say that through the digital, the body of flesh and bones, the physical and mortal body, will be freed of its weight and inertia. At the end of this transfiguration, it will eventually be able to move through the looking glass, cut away from biological corruption and restituted to a synthetic universe of flux. But this is an illusion, for just as there is no humanity without bodies, likewise, humanity will never know freedom alone, outside of society and community, and never can freedom come at the expense of the biosphere.3We must start afresh. To survive, we must return to all living things\u2014including the biosphere\u2014the space and energy they need. In its dank underbelly, modernity has been an interminable war on life. And it is far from over. One of the primary modes of this war, leading straight to the impoverishment of the world and to the desiccation of entire swathes of the planet, is the subjection to the digital.In the aftermath of this calamity there is a danger that rather than offering sanctuary to all living species, sadly the world will enter a new period of tension and brutality.2 In terms of geopolitics, the logic of power and might will continue to dominate. For lack of a common infrastructure, a vicious partitioning of the globe will intensify, and the dividing lines will become even more entrenched. Many states will seek to fortify their borders in the hope of protecting themselves from the outside. They will also seek to conceal the constitutive violence that they continue to habitually direct at the most vulnerable. Life behind screens and in gated communities will become the norm.In Africa especially, but in many places in the Global South, energy-intensive extraction, agricultural expansion, predatory sales of land, and destruction of forests will continue unabated. The powering and cooling of computer chips and supercomputers depends on it. The purveying and supplying of the resources and energy necessary for the global computing infrastructure will require further restrictions on human mobility. Keeping the world at a distance will become the norm so as to keep risks of all kinds on the outside. But because it does not address our ecological precariousness, this catabolic vision of the world, inspired by theories of immunization and contagion, does little to break out of the planetary impasse in which we find ourselves.4All these wars on life begin by taking away breath. Likewise, as it impedes breathing and blocks the resuscitation of human bodies and tissues, COVID-19 shares this same tendency. After all, what is the purpose of breathing if not the absorption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide in a dynamic exchange between blood and tissues? But at the rate that life on Earth is going, and given what remains of the wealth of the planet, how far away are we really from the time when there will be more carbon dioxide than oxygen to breathe?Before this virus, humanity was already threatened with suffocation. If war there must be, it cannot so much be against a specific virus as against everything that condemns the majority of humankind to a premature cessation of breathing, everything that fundamentally attacks the respiratory tract, everything that, in the long reign of capitalism, has constrained entire segments of the world population, entire races, to a difficult, panting breath and life of oppression. To come through this constriction would mean that we conceive of breathing beyond its purely biological aspect, and instead as that which we hold in common, that which, by definition, eludes all calculation. By which I mean the universal right to breathe.As that which is both ungrounded and our common ground, the universal right to breath is unquantifiable and cannot be appropriated. From a universal perspective, not only is it the right of every member of humankind, but of all life. It must therefore be understood as a fundamental right to existence. Consequently, it cannot be confiscated and thereby eludes all sovereignty, symbolizing the sovereign principle par excellence. Moreover, it is an originary right to living on Earth, a right that belongs to the universal community of earthly inhabitants, human and other.3CodaThe case has been pressed already a thousand times. We recite the charges eyes shut. Whether it is the destruction of the biosphere, the takeover of minds by technoscience, the criminalizing of resistance, repeated attacks on reason, generalized cretinization, or the rise of determinisms (genetic, neuronal, biological, environmental), the dangers faced by humanity are increasingly existential.Of all these dangers, the greatest is that all forms of life will be rendered impossible. Between those who dream of uploading our conscience to machines and those who are sure that the next mutation of our species lies in freeing ourselves from our biological husk, there\u2019s little difference. The eugenicist temptation has not dissipated. Far from it, in fact, since it is at the root of recent advances in science and technology.At this juncture, this sudden arrest arrives, an interruption not of history but of something that still eludes our grasp. Since it was imposed upon us, this cessation derives not from our will. In many respects, it is simultaneously unforeseen and unpredictable. Yet what we need is a voluntary cessation, a conscious and fully consensual interruption. Without which there will be no tomorrow. Without which nothing will exist but an endless series of unforeseen events.If, indeed, COVID-19 is the spectacular expression of the planetary impasse in which humanity finds itself today, then it is a matter of no less than reconstructing a habitable earth to give all of us the breath of life. We must reclaim the lungs of our world with a view to forging new ground. Humankind and biosphere are one. Alone, humanity has no future. Are we capable of rediscovering that each of us belongs to the same species, that we have an indivisible bond with all life? Perhaps that is the question\u2014the very last\u2014before we draw our last dying breath.NotesAchille Mbembe is the author of Brutalisme (Paris, 2020).

We know that its reach is across borders, that it comingles in a way that is rapidly disappearing into a seemingly distant past, that it transfers and transforms. Now, under the regime of social distancing, where I show my care for you by stepping away, what is it to translate? For there\u2019s no reading more intimate than a translation\u2014a bodily intimacy that adopts the rhythm of the lungs, the pulse of the heart, the coursing of the blood through the text to the point that we ask, whose breath is it anyway?I know that this text kept me alive\u2014merci, Achille Mbembe. That it came out of the blue, bringing a breath of fresh air\u2014thank you, Hank Scotch. And that I\u2019ll pass it on to you, readers of Critical Inquiry, hoping that it frees up the atmosphere. Because we need to breathe together. And there is no solitary breath.\u2014Trans.1.

Comedy has issues.One worry comedy engages is formal or technical in a way that leads to the social: the problem of figuring out distinctions between things, including people, whose relation is mutually disruptive of definition. Classic comedy theory points to rapid frame breaking, including scalar shifts, as central to comedic pleasure. Scenes, bodies, and words dissolve into surprising component parts; objects violate physics or, worse, insist on its laws against all obstacles.In this view comedy is always a pleasure-spectacle of form's self-violation. From Sigmund Freud's model of wit as transgression to Alenka Zupan\u010di\u010d's definition of comedy as the expression of the universal in the concrete, comedic events take place with such rapidity or illogicity that we can't believe, for a moment, what's in front of us or what we've heard.2 Henri Bergson's classic location of comic laughter at the spectacle of \"something mechanical encrusted upon the living\" is itself disrupted by Zupan\u010di\u010d's revision, which is that the question of what's living, what's mechanical, and who needs to know is what really haunts the comedic and makes it an uncanny scene of aesthetic, moral, and political judgment.3Comedy's propensity to get in trouble\u2014sometimes greater even than genres like horror or porn\u2014gets thrown into sharper relief when we think of it as a vernacular form. What we find comedic (or just funny) is sensitive to changing contexts. It is sensitive because the funny is always tripping over the not funny, sometimes appearing identical to it. The contexts that incite these issues of how to manage disruptive difference do not just emerge through cultural comparisons, either: a laugh in one world causing sheer shame in another, say. The culture concept can presume too much homogeneity in any given locality even when there's agreement on antagonisms and norms, as Judith Farquhar's essay demonstrates. Consider, too, the ongoing debates in the US over rape and race jokes, new normative constraints that are inciting comedians to make sadface statements and avoid youthful audiences who used to seem to be in on the joke.4 It is as though in the current moment of social claims-making some comedians have become the butts of their own jokes, exiled to the outside of where they used to feel sovereign. It is as though comedy is freshly dangerous.Thus comedy isn't just an anxiogenic tableau of objects disrupted by status shifting, collapse and persistence, the disruption by difference, or a veering between the tiny and the large.5 Nor is it just a field of narrative expectation punctuated by the surprise of laughter or vertiginous enjoyment. It is also epistemologically troubling, drawing insecure boundaries as though it were possible to secure confidence about object ontology or the value of an \"us\" versus all its others.6 Political cartoons, religious iconoclasm, matters of the risible are sometimes ordinary and, in some places, matters of life and death.7 Anthony Ashley-Cooper (the Earl of Shaftesbury) and Simon Critchley point to an analogy between the experience of humor and aesthetic judgment as such; both remind us of forms of intersubjectivity we usually don't think about but that we rediscover as presupposed by our very compulsion to make jokes and judgments in the first place.8 Comedy helps us test or figure out what it means to say \"us.\" Always crossing lines, it helps us figure out what lines we desire or can bear.9 Precisely through the potential disagreement they inevitably provoke, both aesthetic judgments and comedy \"recall us to what is shared [and not shared] in our everyday practices.\" And not \"through the clumsiness of a theoretical description, but more quietly, practically and discreetly\" (OH, p. 18).10But maybe not so discretely. In this era of proliferating social fractures the presence of comedy as weapon and shield, pedagogy and performance, saturates the most ordinary spaces. Arpad Szakolczai calls this a demand and laments the \"commedification\" of the public sphere.11 While the Bakhtinian account of carnival's permission for the grotesque to disrupt social hierarchy still obtains, the affective labor of the comedic as a socially lubricating mood commandeers comedy to enable the very contradictions and stresses to which it also points.12 How should we understand comedy differently, and how does comedy stage its own anxiety-producing/alleviating, social-distance-gauging missions differently, if people are increasingly supposed to be funny all the time?Both the world and comedy change when there's a demand for permanent carnival. We do not share Szakolczai's paranoia about the theatricalization of social life (against which he makes a plea for \"more specific attention to belongingness in existential communities\") or his view of comedy as a maleficent virus, \"infecting\" Western Europe to this day, transforming politics into farce and the public sphere into a place of \"permanent liminality.\"13 But it is worth stressing the originality of putting comedy\u2014as opposed to mass-mediated entertainment, capitalist commercialism, or the performance principle\u2014at the heart and origin of the public sphere.14 This sets Szakolczai's argument apart from adjacent arguments in Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944), Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business (1985), or Jon McKenzie's Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance (2001).15 To say that it is comedy that people increasingly come to expect in the kinds of social interaction that take place in all zones of modern life\u2014politics, education, journalism, even religion\u2014is something different from talking about a mode and mood of hyperenjoyment made by the culture industry, which runs on a great deal of high seriousness as well.These operations of comedy as judgment about aesthetic and social form have also morphed into an overarching tone of late capitalist sociability, affecting how people self-consciously play as well as work together and the spaces where they do so (including Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube). This does not mean that all affective labor is comedic; affective labor is caring labor, and caring labor absorbs a range of moods. But the demand for play and fun as good and necessary for social membership is everywhere inflecting what was once called alienation.16Often said to be a genre unusually sensitive to timing, comedy in the United States has arguably saturated the Just in Time (JIT), logistics-enabled workplace in particular, organizing and informing the informal affective cultures that lubricate production, circulation, and consumption. From Cathy and Dilbert to the Mary Tyler Moore Show, Taxi, WKRP in Cincinnati, The Office, and Silicon Valley, comedy that appears in the workplace, as if designed explicitly for display or discussion there, tends to be about the workplace, reterritorializing it as a space of comedy. What results is a reflexive mirroring familiar to denizens of what Mark Seltzer calls \"the official world,\" where we find everything doubled by its own description.17 Timing and mimesis: these are of course internal features of comedy, and we will see them taken up more directly as both formal and political issues in virtually all of the essays to follow and especially those by Mladen Dolar and Roger Grant.All of this is to say that comedic situations are not only in art but in the world. The questions are not only how do they get enmeshed but how does comedy, now referring specifically to the artistic form or practice, respond to that enmeshment in turn? Does it bear down harder on traditional markers\u2014more slapstick, more sexual difference, more grotesque conventionality\u2014as well as dissolving more dramatically into the unfunny? This volume not only attends to these matters at the personal scale of schadenfreude or mimicking, as in David Simon's and Dolar's essays, but also turns to the spaces of capital's movement and demands to track the structural pervasiveness and impersonality of comedic situations. So, what's machinic in the capitalist-comedic scene, what relies on relentless value-making mechanisms of repetition, insistence, and productivity appears not only in Joshua Clover's analysis of the tragedy/farce problematic in capitalist reproduction but also in Anca Parvulescu's analysis of the Laff Box as a figure for contemporary compelled subjectivity and in Sianne Ngai's work on the gimmick, which at once standardizes labor-related subjectivity and produces spontaneous aesthetic judgments against standardization, as though we can ever be outside of it, now.Related to this interpenetration of comedy as art and as life is a sense we have that it is no longer clear what the \"opposite\" of comedy is. The go-to foil used to be tragedy. Whether this is or ever was true or just a useful heuristic, the setting of comedy against tragedy has been undeniably generative for centuries of comedy theory, from ancient Greece onward, making a mountain of memorable sound bites: \"The world is a comedy to those that think, and tragedy to those that feel\" (Horace Walpole); \"Tragedy is the image of Fate, as comedy is of Fortune\" (Susanne Langer); \"Take a tragedy, accelerate the movement, and you will have a comic play\" (Eugene Ionesco); \"Tragedy + time = comedy,\" (attributed to Mark Twain), and so on. But is this still the case? Note how the next three sayings, and the final one in particular, suggest that the opposition between comedy and tragedy has itself come to seem theoretically mechanical and thus good fodder for joking. \"Tragedy + time - comedy = German comedy\" (Eric Jarosinski); \"Napoleon, who was a psychologist when he wished to be so, had noticed that the transition from tragedy to comedy is effected simply by sitting down\" (Simon Critchley); \"Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die\" (Mel Brooks).18If it can sometimes be hard to tell if or how comedy is comedy, this might be because some people think a comedy without pleasure or laughter violates itself more extremely than, say, porn that does not produce a desired arousal or a weepie that doesn't make us cry. It might also be that contemporary comedy suffuses so many genres that are not comedy it is hard to draw lines: porn, horror, melodrama (the classic body genres identified by Linda Williams) along with westerns, kung fu, and, of course, romance.19 Glenda Carpio's essay here, \"'Am I Dead?'\" argues too that migrant suffering has newly developed a genre of gallows humor about the psycho-physiological consequences of capitalist modernity, geopolitical displacement, and varieties of social death.Perhaps, in addition to its swarming effect or external action on other genres, there is something internal to comedy\u2014maybe its capacity to hold together a greater variety of manifestly clashing or ambiguous affects\u2014that makes its boundaries so uniquely ambiguous. This last proposition mirrors Mikhail Bakhtin's claims about the novel: its capacity to absorb other aesthetic forms into modes, representational and aesthetic logics. Funnily, Mark McGurl's argument, in this issue, is that the novel achieved this absorption at the cost of comedy, exiling whatever's out of scale and inconvenient to realist causality.Norbert Elias's \"Essay on Laughter\"\u2014published for the first time in this issue\u2014takes up the scene of judgment comedy always calls into being about what it means to be out of control, more body than mind, more awkward than graceful, more ridiculous than sublime, and in a way that confuses desire and aggression. These concerns appear throughout Comedy, an Issue, which takes up the question of genre not just as an aesthetic topic but also as a scene of affective mediation and expectation. This set of collapses, clashes, and boundary disputes is exactly what enables us to have such spirited debates about comedy and in a way we don't feel as compelled to do for other genres.Rising HumorlessnessBut how do we stack up these observations about comedy's transformation from interruption into expectation, its infiltration of other genres, and the \"commedification\" of modern social life, against another claim that seems equally true, which is that humorlessness is on the rise? If the comedic is pervasive even in traditionally serious occupations like politics and law (see Peter Goodrich in this issue on the repeated assertion and disavowal of wit in legal judgment), why is comedy still always getting itself and its practitioners into trouble?\"Only comedy can still get to us,\" said postwar dramatist Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt (\"Uns kommt nur noch die Komodie bei\"); events like the Charlie Hebdo massacre prove him still right (but then who was the us there and what social fractures were revealed?).20 So many recent events testify to an intensification of humorlessness that seems to run counter to, but may be actually compatible with, the becoming permanent of comedy.21 As Lauren Berlant's essay brings out in particular, humorlessness and humor are as inextricably linked as, well, inextricably and linked. The mirthless are an especial object of ridicule, even intolerable\u2014but as such, essential for comedy to happen\u2014and perhaps because, as Friedrich Nietzsche suggests, mirthlessness threatens to consume the world. \"A single joyless person is enough to create constant discouragement and cloudy skies for an entire household\u2026. Happiness is not nearly so contagious a disease. Why?\"22Comedy's frequent failure to induce the pleasure that magnetizes us to it not only incites the policing of intimate others but also reveals philosophical and personal uncertainty about the implications of aesthetic judgment. One response, seen in critical theories of comedy, is to maintain and amplify distinctions between true and false comedy. This protects the desire for aesthetic experience of any kind to be elevating, self-developing, or worthy of idealization. It also often involves the mistaking of an aesthetic judgment for an ontological judgment about the artwork. The critic attributes her or his response entirely to the object, excluding her or his own investments in judgment's pleasures and elevations. The second response to comic failure involves bad feelings when comedy fails to be funny. This points not just to the conventional thud after a bad pun, which is its own genre of fun, but an aggrieved sense of having been denied laughter or having had one's pleasures disrespected or devalued. This also explains some of the rage at feminism and other forms of subaltern political correctness that get into the wheelhouse of people's pleasures and spontaneity.The move to overwrite the distinction between funny and not funny as a distinction between true and false comedy is especially interesting in the work of Critchley and Zupan\u010di\u010d. For in spite of the playful tone of their writing, here the true/false comedy distinction mirrors the genuine art/nonart distinction made in high seriousness by Adorno and Michael Fried, among others; what is clearly a distinction between art the critic admires and art he or she doesn't gets rewritten as a distinction between what is and what simply isn't art but rather entertainment or objecthood.23For Critchley, inauthenticity is precisely what makes humor humor and what makes it aesthetically and philosophically attractive in the first place: \"I would argue that humour recalls us to the modesty and limitedness of the human condition, a limitedness that calls not for tragic-heroic affirmation but comic acknowledgement, not Promethean but a (OH, p. for when comedy fails a test in the of an aesthetic failure he calls or it is of its status as comedy.

      "abstract": "Abstract Systematic literature reviews are an increasingly used review methodology to synthesize the existing body of literature in a field. However, editors complain about a high number of desk rejections because of a lack in quality. Poorly developed review articles are not published because of a perceived lack of contribution to the field. Our article supports authors of standalone papers and graduate students in the Entrepreneurship domain to write contribution-focused systematic reviews e.g. by providing a concrete guideline. Our article analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of a systematic literature review and how they can be overcome. Furthermore, we provide a combined list of highly ranked journals in the Entrepreneurship domain as a basis for quality appraisal. Finally, this article builds a scenario for the future of the systematic literature review methodology and shows how technological improvements have changed this methodology and what can be achieved in the future.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Stand-up so closely resembles-and is meant to resemble-the styles and expectations of everyday speech that the idea of technique and technical mastery we typically associate with art is almost rendered invisible. Technique and technical mastery is as much about the understanding and development of audiences as collaborators as it is the generation of material. Doing so requires encountering audiences in places that by custom or design encourage ludic and vernacular talk-social spaces and third spaces such as bars, coffee houses, and clubs. Cultivating uncultivated speech and cultivating real audiences in found settings form the background of developing the stand-up comedian, neither of which lend themselves to the conservatory tradition we think of when we think of the development of artists. This article addresses two areas of the overall question of stand-up as art, starting with the ontological question of stand-up comedy: if it is an art where is it located, and what we may mean by \u201cartworks\u201d and \u201cartworld\u201d in stand-up comedy? Then I consider whether stand-up comedy as practiced can be reconciled with several recent definitions for art and note some of the special conditions and contexts for stand-up.",

      "abstract": "This volume grew out of a 2013 symposium at Brown University focused on ritual violence. It consists of eight essays exploring the ritual dimensions of violence and the larger theorization of ritual violence. A brief introduction by Olyan outlines three aims: to show the full range of violent rites in the Hebrew Bible, what ritual violence might accomplish sociopolitically, and how ritual violence is enhanced through violence theory and other theoretical models. Following the essays are an index of biblical/nonbiblical references as well as an extensive subject index.Debra Scoggins Ballentine examines the manipulation of bodies and body parts by using the killing of Rechab and Baanah (2 Sam 4) as a case study. She engages with categories of violence, ritual, and ritual violence, arguing that ritual violence is met with a different set of rules and responses. Thus, while the killing of Eshbaal is regular violence, the subsequent killing of the murderers is just, so typical social rules do not apply. In this way, David is exonerated. A helpful chart lays out the cutting off of various body parts, enabling Scoggins Ballentine to suggest nuanced lexical choices.The command to dispossess Canaanite nations is examined by T. M. Lemos. Lemos draws attention to much broader definitions of genocide that focus on putting the very existence of a group in jeopardy. Specifically, she connects material scarcity with genocide, illuminated by the 1994 Rwandan genocide as a case study. Demographic estimates, coupled with archaeological surveys from the Iron II are employed to argue for both population growth and a decreased amount of available land. These factors, along with evidence from the Mesha Stele and a number of biblical texts, connect genocidal behavior with the desire for territory.Mark Leuchter examines the purposes of Josiah\u2019s actions in destroying the cultic shrine at Bethel (2 Kgs 23:15\u201320). In his view, the function of the story is a means to conquer forces opposed to YHWH rather than the more common interpretation of a political act. Ashurbanipal\u2019s campaign against Elam, where he also destroyed tombs and bones, is utilized to provide insight into Josiah\u2019s actions. While Ashurbanipal did this to verify his political hierarchy, Josiah\u2019s actions were not political, as they erased the identity of those burned. More importantly, Leuchter argues that Josiah\u2019s actions mirror the \u201cethno-mythology\u201d of Israel. In other words, Josiah ritually reenacts the divine warrior\u2019s conquest.Several cognitive-theoretical models are outlined by Nathaniel Levtow in order to understand human iconoclastic tendencies better. He argues that iconoclasm is a form of iconism because of permeability across ontological categories (a cult icon both violates and blends distinctions of \u201cartifact\u201d and \u201cliving thing\u201d). Levtow then uses a theory of religious transmission to help explain why biblical iconoclastic traditions are so successful. Here, routines of words and rites along with imagistic enactments of events are modes of transmission that help provide a center for religious concepts to cohere. Last, he argues that iconism is cognitively optimal, while aniconism is cognitively costly. However, the act of destroying an image (imagistic enactment) is pivotal to aniconism, as it generates a memory that is otherwise difficult to retain. Put differently, iconism and iconoclasm both require idols.Susan Niditch draws attention to the taking and giving of women through stories of rape (Gen 34 and Judg 19), wife or woman stealing (Deut 21; Num 31; and especially Judg 21), and the sacrificial ritual of Jephthah\u2019s daughter (Judg 11). Niditch underscores that women serve as sacrifices that establish bonds between men, noting that the bonds do not always lead to less violence. In the case of Jephthah\u2019s daughter, Niditch highlights the theme of the exchange of a woman from an initial young status to a liminal phase to a new status and place in the social structure.Saul Olyan investigates the meaning of severing the head of a dead body as rational and goal-orientated. In addition to West Asian sources, he focuses on four texts: the death of Saul, the murder of Eshbaal, the rebellion of Sheba, and Jehu\u2019s usurpation. Olyan emphasizes the role of ritual violence in decapitation as a means to identify the person and make a clear statement about certain death. It may further communicate humiliation for survivors and may also serve to intimidate those who might be tempted to not conform. Last, the violence may terminate and generate new affiliation.War-related ritual acts at the city gate are the focus of R\u00fcdiger Schmitt\u2019s essay. He employs the concepts of liminality, communitas, and social drama and how these may be enacted at the city gate. Textual, archaeological, and iconographic evidence are utilized to argue that the city gate, especially in ancient Israel, was a place for public ritual performances of loyalty and war preparation. This is seen paradigmatically through acts of David at the gate in light of Absalom\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.Jacob Wright examines urbicide\u2014the killing of cities\u2014and draws attention to its power to destroy cultural memory. He first highlights the theme through texts and iconography from Mesopotamia and Egypt. Wright next traces the theme in the Hebrew Bible\u2014noting Sodom and Gomorrah as paradigmatic\u2014while highlighting that oracles against the nations use threats and images of urbicide. Last, reflecting on urbicide as ritual, he examines the symbolic reversals enacted thorough destruction and symbolic and cosmologically appropriate modes of destruction.As a whole, the contributors are to be commended for methodological justification of relevant social-scientific theories. On the one hand, the essays cover both well-known issues, such as the slaughter of Canaanites or the complicated motives of David\u2019s actions. At the same time, the volume also addresses seldom-raised questions such as urbicide or cognitive perspectives on iconoclasm. On the other hand, readers may quibble on whether the full range of violent rites can be broached when the majority of essays lean toward forms of military violence. Little attention is given, for example, to manifestations of cultic violence. In sum, this is a wonderful volume sure to spark new research questions.",

      "abstract": "A series of weaknesses in creativity, research design, and quality of writing continue to handicap energy social science. Many studies ask uninteresting research questions, make only marginal contributions, and lack innovative methods or application to theory. Many studies also have no explicit research design, lack rigor, or suffer from mangled structure and poor quality of writing. To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice.",

The relevance of the presented article is determined by the worldview crisis of the postmodern time and the growing demand for the formation of the foundations of the worldview of Russian society. The comparison method determines the basic components of the worldview - the perception of space and time (space-time continuum), the establishment of the fundamental principles of being (metaphysics and ontology) and the disclosure of the essence of man (anthropology). The article traces the connection of each of the worldview parameters with the genesis of classical ideologies. A position is put forward on the preservation and re-actualization of the mythological worldview in the worldview systems of the New and Modern times. The connection between the mythological archetypes of pre-modern society and modern political mythology is traced. The influence of the traditions of sacred geography and the attitudes of we-centricity on the modern geopolitical positioning of the states of the world is shown. A modification of the traditions of the eschatological perception of historical time in classical political theories is revealed. Disclosure of the fundamental principles of worldview systems is considered in connection with the definition of paradigms of classical ideologies. The variability of social and cultural approaches is revealed in connection with the difference in political strategies. The practical conclusion of the article lies in the definition of mythologems of worldview matrices as a semantic foundation of state sovereignty, the expediency of representing national mythology and the contraindication of demythologization.",

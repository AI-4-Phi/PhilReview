This understanding of traditional authority also reveals why the Standard Model misconstrues the structure of ordinary, informal statuses, such as friendship.",

This reconstructed typology is coherent and allows us to explain the special status of the belief in legitimacy.

However, the author of the article tries to demonstrate that three main Weberian aspects of the state \u2014 1) the monopoly on legitimate physical violence, 2) the relationship of domination, which is accompanied by a minimum desire to obey, and 3) the chance for the regular reproducibility of these relationships \u2014 are consonant with Landauer\u2019s concept of the state.",

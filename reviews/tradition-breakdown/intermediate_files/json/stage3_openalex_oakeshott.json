      "abstract": "In 1948 Karl Popper sent a copy of his paper, \u2018Utopia and Violence\u2019, to Michael Oakeshott. Popper had recently read Oakeshott\u2019s essay \u2018Rationalism in Politics\u2019, appreciating its relevance to views he had expressed in The Open Society. Oakeshott wrote to Popper at some length, explaining his thoughts about reason, tradition and kindred matters, to which Popper responded. This paper reproduces these letters and discusses them with reference to pertinent writings of Popper and Oakeshott. While showing there was much common ground between the two men and that they significantly influenced each other, the writings reveal important differences over the role of reason and tradition in social and political life.",

I show that they both theorise the conditions of the modern political community as a \u2018civil association\u2019, and I argue that this comparison enables us to challenge predominant understandings of each thinker and to address criticisms levelled against them. I demonstrate that the contextualist and Hegelian aspects of Habermas' earlier work are carried over into his later work on discourse ethics and that he puts forward a more situated understanding of rationality and morality than is usually acknowledged. I also show that Oakeshott is not a straightforward conservative and in some respect he can be seen as a forerunner of deliberative politics. However, this comparison takes us beyond an exercise in interpretation, and I also draw attention to the practical possibilities residing in the work of Oakeshott and Habermas. Indeed, it is my contention that each of their approaches has much to offer in addressing the challenges of pluralism characteristic of contemporary multicultural societies and that their respective works can contribute to a contemporary theory of critical republicanism.",

This article exposes the essence of each in Oakeshott's writings, analyses their complex relationship and shows how far back in human history they reached. Neither was, for Oakeshott, distinctly modern. In fact, he traced ideology and rationalism alike to the birth of philosophy in ancient Greece, even while he acknowledged important differences in their ancient and modern manifestations. Oakeshott's outlook with respect to these phenomena was significantly more pessimistic than that of other 20th-century analysts. He did not think our problems were easily curable. He did, however, harbour some hope (albeit dreamy) that in the domain of politics in particular, the metaphor of \u2018conversation\u2019 might somehow loosen the grip of ideological thought and action.",

After sketching a brief biography of Oakeshott, Franco then examines his most distinctive ideas, including his early idealist theory of knowledge, his influential critique of rationalism and central social planning, and his liberal theory of civil association. Though best known as a political philosopher, Oakeshott also made significant contributions to the philosophy of history, aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, and the philosophy of education. Franco highlights Oakeshott's impressive achievements in each of these areas. His book is an essential introduction to the whole range of Oakeshott's thought, and it sets the philosopher's work in historical context while also demonstrating its relevance to contemporary debates in political philosophy.",

The article seeks to identify the origin of this policy, using the work of Michael Oakeshott (1962 Oakeshott, M. 1962. Rationalism in politics and other essays, London: Methuen and Co. [Google Scholar]) as a framework for discussing the rationality of new Labour. The rhetoric of the government during the passage of the 2004 Higher Education Act is analysed to identify the extent to which rationalism is demonstrated in the policy-making process and this is contrasted with Oakeshott's conception of policy as evolution. The article concludes that variable tuition fees resulted from a process of conservative evolution, notwithstanding rhetoric of rationality, and discusses the implications of this for the future direction of British higher education policy.",

      "abstract": "Indicators are increasingly used in international human rights monitoring, and time, expertise and resources are being devoted in ever-growing quantities to the production of more apparently powerful and sophisticated ways to objectively measure human rights performance. However, there is a certain level of resistance and scepticism to the statistical measurement of human rights on the part of many practitioners and advocates, who argue that it is reductionist and disruptive to their work. This article uses the writing of Michael Oakeshott as a lens through which to examine the shift towards indicators and argues that it is a project that is strongly characterized by rationalism: a desire for certainty, uniformity and clarity that neglects the experiential, tacit, and conversational. This not only provides a method for analysing the dangers present in the phenomenon but also explains why the reliance on indicators and other measurement methods seems destined to grow despite the reservations held by practitioners and scholars alike.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This essay argues against the view\u2014frequently put forward by conservatives themselves\u2014that conservatism cannot be analyzed as a coherent political ideology. It then proposes a multidimensional approach to understanding conservatism, defining (and defending a particular interpretation of) four dimensions which are termed sociological, methodological, dispositional and philosophical. It is argued that only if two of these four dimensions are present in a particular variety of political thought is it justified to speak of political conservatism. Notes 1. I wish to thank Erika A. Kiss, Olivier Remaud and Andreas R\u00f6dder for comments and suggestions.

      "abstract": "The puzzle of the political significance of expert knowledge has many dimensions, and in this chapter I plan to explore a simple Oakeshottian question in relation to it. To what extent is the present role of expert knowledge similar to that envisioned by the \u201cplanners\u201d of the 1940s who were the inspiration for Oakeshott\u2019s essay, \u201cRationalism in Politics\u201d (1947\u201348)? This role, as Oakeshott and many of its enthusiasts portrayed it, was to replace politics as hitherto practiced with something different. Rationalism thus depended on a theory of the \u201cpolitics\u201d it sought to supplant, though it rarely attempted to articulate this theory. In the context of the time, there was no need. In the 1930s, economic depression and the inability of party politicians in the British parliament to agree on measures to deal with the economic situation provided endless negative examples of \u201cpolitics\u201d standing in the way of action, and a sharp contrast with the state activism of Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin. In the postwar period, the planners had their chance, and the modern British welfare state was born. Much of what this state did applied ideas of Fabian Socialism, which had presented itself as objective, rational, and expert. But as an administrative fact, the welfare state had no need of the ideology of planning, and the discussion faded. The question I wish to address here is this: expertise forms a much larger part of governance than it did in the time of the \u201crationalism\u201d of the planning movement; does this mean that rationalism has arrived by stealth, that is to say in practice, without appealing to the overt ideology of rationalistic planning? This is a question of the place of expertise in our politics, and thus a political question.",

I hope to demonstrate, employing the work of Oakeshott as well as Aristotle and Onora O\u2019Neill, how many libertarian theorists, who generally have a sincere and admirable commitment to personal liberty, have been led astray by the rationalist promise that we might be able to approach deductive certainty concerning the \u2018correctness\u2019 of some political programme. The article will argue that a concept such as Pettit\u2019s freedom as non-domination is more robust and inclusive of all that we value about freedom than is the libertarian concept of freedom as non-interference.",

Over a period of about four decades from the 1930s to the 1970s Oakeshott wrote a series of essays and reviews on Hobbes that remains an important touchstone in the world of Hobbes scholarship. At first glance it might appear odd that Oakeshott the philosophical idealist and critic of rationalism would be attracted to a philosopher such as Hobbes, whose place in the formation of modern rationalism and materialism is the stuff of legend. The fact that this materialist/rationalist reading of Hobbes, to the extent that it is still maintained, is so only in a qualified form, is in no small part due to the work of Oakeshott and a few others, such as Leo Strauss, A. E. Taylor and Howard Warrender, who, in the middle years of the twentieth century overturned many of the traditional assumptions about Hobbes and set the modern Hobbes industry on its course.",

Yet, unlike T\u00f6nnies, Oakeshott later rejected the premises of this tradition. Instead, he formulated the notion of rationalistic non-purposive association, which allowed him to become reconciled to modern liberal society.",

      "abstract": "Michael Oakeshott has always been hard to characterize in terms of political doctrines and ideological persuasions. Everyone agrees he is a sceptic, but there is much less agreement as to what his scepticism implies for politics. Is he a sceptical liberal in the line of Tocqueville and Acton? Or a sceptical conservative in the line of Hume? Or is he sceptical of all politics? He constantly refused conventional political labels, whether Left or Right, liberal or conservative, regarding them as the product of that rationalism in politics he so deplored. He firmly declared that his thought had nothing to do with ideology, the most common form of Rationalist doctrine. Ideology was intellectually empty and had corrupted politics. Ideologies, according to Oakeshott, have supplanted traditions of behaviour, providing cribs for behaviour rather than an education in the activity itself. An ideology is an 'abstract principle or set of related abstract principles which has been independently premeditated'.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Jacob Talmon and Michael Oakeshott represent two opposite tendencies in the anti-totalitarian world view. Both thinkers share many central features of this broad intellectual trend, such as the equation between the Soviet and Nazi regimes, Anglophilia and the rejection of the utopian quest. Yet this basic agreement should not distract us from significant differences in attitude and temperament. Talmon, like most other critics of totalitarianism, was strongly affected by the atmosphere of a profound intellectual and political crisis in Europe, and he regarded the danger of totalitarianism to be an inherent aspect of modernity itself. His liberalism was that of 'fear'. By contrast, for Oakeshott, who believed in the strength of liberal, and specifically British, civilisation, totalitarianism was merely a child of resentment, a parasitic force with no positive message of its own. He thus displayed a greater measure of confidence in the fortunes of liberal modernity.

Michael Oakeshott: An Introduction. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004). Talmon's ideas have so far received relatively little attention. A description of his personality and ideas can be found in Yehoshua Arieli. 'Jacob Talmon\u2014An Intellectual Portrait.'

Hobbes was Oakeshott's favourite thinker (on Oakeshott's interpretation of Hobbes see Steven Gerencser. The Skeptic's Oakeshott. [Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000]); Tocqueville was Talmon's (see Arieli \"Jacob Talmon\u2014an intellectual portrait\", 8\u20139). 3 See Fran\u00e7ois Furet. The Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1995) 266\u2013314. 4 Some early studies of totalitarianism came from the left (written by authors of the Marxist, neo-Marxist or similar kind of persuasion). Marcuse, for example, was a critic of totalitarianism, but he was also a foe of the contemporary liberal democracy. Therefore, he cannot be considered here as an 'anti-totalitarian'. On the criticism of totalitarianism on the left see, for example, William David Jones. 'Toward a Theory of Totalitarianism: Franz Borkenau's Pareto.' Journal of the History of Ideas 53:3 (1992) 455\u2013466. 5 The term was coined by Butterfield (see Herbert Butterfield. The Whig Interpretation of History. [London: G. Bell and Sons, 1931]), who came against reading history backwards. It is worth noting, however, that Butterfield himself later adopted quite a Whiggish view of the character of the Englishman and English history (see his The Englishman and His History. [Cambridge: University Press, 1944]). 6 This goes back to Burke and to his uncompromising stance against the French Revolution. See his letters on a regicide peace in Select Works of Edmund Burke. Vol. 3. Ed. E.J. Payne. (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1999). 7 During the post-War years Talmon also taught at the LSE and was influenced by R.H. Tawney, as well as by Harold Laski, Oakeshott's socialist predecessor at the chair of Political Science there. 8 J.L. Talmon. The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy.

Oakeshott is interested in the highest level of abstraction. Therefore, he prefers to discuss philosophers. With philosophers he feels at home. He analyses thinkers such as Hobbes, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Kant, Hegel and others. Talmon does not avoid philosophers. Rousseau, Fichte and Hegel figure prominently in his writings. Yet he is interested in them not as philosophers per se. Rather, he wants to explore the impact that their ideas had on the political practice of their and later times. Therefore, he often concentrates on ideologists and practitioners such as Mazzini, Lenin or Rosa Luxemburg. 28 Michael Oakeshott. Morality and Politics in Modern Europe: The Harvard Lectures.

Cambridge Review 61 (1939\u20131940) 348. It is interesting to note that Oakeshott is usually silent about Rousseau (contrary to Talmon, for whom Rousseau was the thinker who gave birth to the ideals of totalitarian democracy). Oakeshott's commentators noticed a certain affinity between Oakeshott's ideas and those of Rousseau (see Wendell John Coats, Jr. Oakeshott and His Contemporaries. [Selingsgrove: Susqehanna University Press, 2000] 76\u201388). At the same time, many other of Rousseau's ideas, as well as his general feeling of discontent, would certainly be foreign to Oakeshott. Perhaps Oakeshott could not make up his mind about what to do with Rousseau. Rousseau could be seen as both the quintessential individual and the anti-individual; as a great philosopher (by far greater than, say, St.-Simon or Marx) and a man of ressentiment. Perhaps it is this combination that was a problem for Oakeshott. Rousseau was a creative man, but he was not a self-confident one, and therefore did not fit in Oakeshott's description of the modern individual. 47 See George Enteen. 'Utopianism and Totalitarianism: J.L. Talmon's Final Reckoning.' History of European Ideas 7:2 (1986) 177. 48 J.L. Talmon. 'Jews between Revolution and Counter-Revolution.' Israel among the Nations. (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1970) 44. 49 It must be said, however, that in his last essay, 'The Tower of Babel' (in On History and Other Essays 179\u2013210), Oakeshott strikes a different note and presents a significantly more pessimistic prognosis about the future of free society. 50 Talmon often speaks about the emerging new divide: that between the rich north and the poor south. See, for example, J.L. Talmon. 'The Uniqueness of the Twentieth Century in History.' The Riddle of the Present and the Cunning of History [in Hebrew]. (Jerusalem: Bialik, 2000) 9\u201310. 51 J.L. Talmon. 'Experiment in Utopia: The Lesson of the Israeli Kibbutz.' The Unique and the Universal 269. 52 Their attitudes to patriotism exemplify the difference in their sentiment, despite an apparent similarity in their views. The place of patriotism in the ideas of Talmon and Oakeshott is a separate subject requiring a full length article. Yet a few clarifying remarks may be illuminating here, because the nation state can be considered as a constituent element of modern liberal civilisation, and therefore the attitude to nation state may reveal something about the attitude to modernity in general. At first glance, Talmon's and Oakeshott's positions are undistinguishable. Both were patriots of their peoples and countries. At the same time, neither was a chauvinist or organic nationalist. For both of them, nation state was just a framework for the free development of individuality. Both combined an enlightened patriotism with a measured universalism. Nevertheless, the mode in which patriotism and universalism co-exist in their thinking could not be more different. In Oakeshott, this co-existence is natural and unreflective. He hardly sees any tension between nationalism and universalism, and he never discusses it. For him, to be a generally civilised person means also to belong to a specific civilisation. And he considers the state to be the quintessential form of modern polity. Not so Talmon. In the face of the tragedy of the Jewish people in Europe, he preserved a strong suspicion towards any kind of nationalism or patriotism. At the same time, he recognised the necessity of Jewish nationalism as the most suitable solution for the Jewish condition in the situation of modernity. Thus, on the one hand, he preached universalism, and, on the other, he defended uniqueness, the inescapable necessity of remaining Jewish. And thus, for him, the relationship between universality and uniqueness was not that of a peaceful fusion (as in the case of Oakeshott), but that of the dialectical tension between two opposites. Talmon felt that there existed some incompatibility between nationalism and the quest for universality; yet he also recognised the necessity of both. And if nation state is an important feature of modernity, then the modern age cannot fully legitimise itself, unless it solves this contradiction between universality and uniqueness. 53 Hannah Arendt.

      "abstract": "In recent years, scholars have begun to explore the democratic valences of Michael Oakeshott's political thought. Commentators generally present him either as a skeptical and reluctant democrat or as an advocate of deliberative democracy. This article contends that Oakeshott criticizes some epistemological and substantive commitments that are characteristic of deliberative theories, yet his vision of democracy is more robust than skeptical readers admit. Using the themes of consensus and epistemic politics as points for comparison with the ideas of Oakeshott and deliberative democrats, I consider how his theory of civil association, critique of rationalism, and characterization of conversation as \u201cthe gist and meaning of democracy\u201d speak to contemporary democratic theory. I conclude that he offers a pluralistic ethos, rather than a self-contained model, for democratic politics that has affinities with agonistic theories of democracy.",

      "abstract": "This essay creates an unlikely conversation between two 20th century thinkers: John Rawls and Michael Oakeshott. I say \u201cunlikely\u201d because apart from a few scant remarks in the writing of each the two did not directly engage each other. The essay begins by examining Oakeshott\u2019s explication of \u201cThe Rationalist\u201d and her tradition in the history of political thought. Specifically, the essay shows that rationalism in politics involves the belief that reason is an infallible guide to political activity and that the Rationalist seeks certainty and perfection in political affairs. The essay goes on to tease out the rationalistic tendencies in Rawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice, and then it analyzes Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism and applies these criticisms to Rawls. Briefly, Oakeshott marks a distinction between technical and practical knowledge, and he argues that the principles that make up technical manuals like A Theory of Justice are abridgments of and no substitute for the understanding we gain through our practical experience and our participation in a given political tradition. While explaining Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism and Rawls, the essay indicates some of the relativistic proclivities in Oakeshott\u2019s appeal to political practices and traditions, and then it entertains objections to Oakeshott that a Rawlsian might offer. Here Rawls\u2019 commitment to the liberal tradition and the relativity implicit in his explanations of \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d and \u201creasonableness\u201d are examined and Rawls\u2019 similarities to Oakeshott are noted. Ultimately, this essay argues that the strength of Rawls\u2019 work lay not in the fact that his principles of justice are established by rational agents in an original position, but in the fact that they are principles that emerge from and cohere with ideas deeply rooted in the Western tradition itself.",

      "abstract": "Many commentators have mentioned the fact that Michael Oakeshott describes the American founding as a \"Rationalist\" project. But there has been little careful investigation into the actual character of his criticisms. This essay first considers the critique on its own terms before turning to an examination of the alternative that Oakeshott recommends, which is designated \"the rule of law.\" Several observations emerge from this analysis. First, Oakeshott's concept of Rationalism still has purchase in the present day. Second, it can be applied to contemporary American law and politics as a way of illuminating certain widespread political tendencies. And finally, it is possible both to appropriate his critique and simultaneously to moderate it such that it proves beneficial for thinking about our current political situation in the United States.",

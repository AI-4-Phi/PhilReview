      "snippet": "By analyzing the full phenomena of authenticity and tracing its first technical uses back to Heidegger\u2019s early lectures on Aristotle, I show that Heidegger\u2019s methodological breakthrough in the early 1920s, the development of hermeneutic phenomenology, and the very structure of Being and Time are the result of Heidegger\u2019s appropriation of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical method. By analyzing these lectures and traditionally ignored uses of authenticity in Being and Time, I develop an account of the methodological sense of authenticity which looks to the tradition to uncover phenomena which have been obscured and covered over.",

A Swiss native educated in American folklore programs, Bendix moves effortlessly between the two traditions, demonstrating how the notion of authenticity was used not only to foster national causes, but also to lay the foundations for categories of documentation and analysis within the nascent field of folklore studies.",

      "snippet": "This volume centers on the exploration of the ways in which the canonical texts and thinkers of the phenomenological and existential tradition can be utilized to address contemporary, concrete philosophical issues. In particular, the included essays address the key facets of the work of Charles Guignon, and as such, honor and extend his thought and approach to philosophy. To this end, the four main sections of the volume deal with the question of authenticity, id est what it means to be an authentic person, the ways in which the phenomenological and existential traditions can impact the sciences, how best to understand the fact of human mortality, and, finally, the ways philosophical reflection can help address current questions of value.",

There remains a need to explore and analyze these fundamental aspects of the farmers\u2019 market and to consider how they influence their formation and function. This paper argues that discourses of authenticity are central to the identity of the farmers\u2019 market, and that they are constructed differently \u201cfrom above\u201d by those seeking to regulate farmers\u2019 markets in particular jurisdictions and \u201cfrom below\u201d by managers, producers, and consumers at individual markets.",

      "preamble": "Edmund Burke, author of Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance , is known to a worldwide public as a classic political\nthinker: it is less well understood that his intellectual achievement\ndepended upon his understanding of philosophy and use of it in the\npractical writings and speeches by which he is chiefly known. The\npresent essay explores the character and significance of the use of\nphilosophy in his political thought. That thought is of the very first\nimportance for intellectual history and for the conduct of politics.\nThis essay is the first attempt to examine its philosophical character\nand to connect the latter with Burke\u2019s political activity. In\ndoing so it shows the importance of the philosophical elements in\nBurke\u2019s thought and how these contribute important ways to his\npolitical thought.",

          "content": "The name of Edmund Burke (1730\u201397) [ 1 ] is not one that often figures in the history of philosophy .[ 2 ] This is a curious fate for a writer of genius who was also the author\nof a book entitled A Philosophical Enquiry . Besides the Enquiry , Burke\u2019s writings and some of his speeches\ncontain strongly philosophical elements\u2014philosophical both in\nour contemporary sense and in the eighteenth century sense, especially\n\u2018philosophical\u2019 history. These elements play a fundamental\nrole within his work, and help us to understand why Burke is a\npolitical classic. His writings and speeches therefore merit attention\nas examples of attention to both ideas and to history, and of the role\nof this attention in practical thought. His work is also, as we see\nshall see at the end of this entry, an achievement that challenges\nassumptions held by many of our contemporaries. One way or another,\nthen, Burke is a vitally important figure. Yet there is very little\nacademic writing about Burke and philosophy outside of that Enquiry . This is a significant omission from the history of\npolitical thought, for at least three reasons. One is that though much\nhas been written about Burke, including work placing him in relation\nto other political writers, yet how he thought has not been made\nclear. A second is that the rational content of his thinking has not\nbeen made evident, precisely because its philosophical component has\nnot been identified. Thirdly, because the manner and content of his\nthought have not been identified in the way the case warrants, we read\nof Burke\u2019s \u2018mystic spirit\u2019 (Spurgeon 1922, p. 100)\nor the \u2018irrationalism\u2019 of his writing (Butler 1984, p.\n35). This matters not only with respect to historical truth, important\nthough that is, but also because Burke continues to be treated as a\nsymbolic or instructive figure for contemporary political action (cf.,\ne.g., Norman 2013; Stephens (2020)), and in significant ways marks an\ninstructive contrast with some current ways of thinking. This being\nso, it is especially important to understand the historical figure,\nand, importantly, the general elements in his thought, including the\nphilosophical ones."

          "content": "Burke was born at Dublin in Ireland, then part of the British Empire,\nthe son of a prosperous attorney, and, after an early education at\nhome, became a boarder at the school run by Abraham Shackleton, a\nQuaker from Yorkshire, at Ballitore in County Kildare. Burke received\nhis university education at Trinity College, Dublin, a bastion of the\nAnglican Church of Ireland. Thence he proceeded to the Middle Temple\nat London, in order to qualify for the Bar, but legal practice was\nless attractive to him than the broader perspective which had captured\nhis attention at university (or earlier). It was first as a writer,\nand then as a public figure that he made his career. Burke\u2019s\nintellectual formation did not suggest that his career would be purely\nphilosophical. Indeed, for those without an independent income or a\nclerical vocation such a way of life was not very feasible in Britain\nor Ireland. Only the Scottish universities offered many posts that did\nnot require holy orders, but they were not very receptive to\nnon-presbyterians. Burke married in 1756, and had a son by 1758, so\nthat a career of Humean celibacy, in which philosophy was cultivated\non a little oatmeal, was not for him. Burke, like Hume, found that there was more money in narrative works\nand in practical affairs than in philosophy. Burke\u2019s earliest\nwritings include A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our\nIdeas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757), and A Vindication\nof Natural Society (1756). Thereafter he was co-author of An\nAccount of the European Settlements (1757) and began An\nAbridgement of English History (c.1757\u201362). From 1758, at\nleast until 1765, he was the principal \u2018conductor\u2019 of the\nnew Annual Register . In 1765, Burke became private secretary\nto the Marquis of Rockingham (who had just become First Lord of the\nTreasury, i.e. the chief minister of the Crown in Great Britain and\nIreland) and was elected to the British House of Commons in the same\nyear. He remained there, with a brief intermission in the Autumn of\n1780, for nearly twenty-nine years, retiring in the Summer of 1794.\nBurke, who was always a prominent figure there and sometimes an\neffective persuader, gave a great many parliamentary speeches. He\npublished versions of some of these, notably on American\nTaxation (1774), Conciliation with America (1775), and Fox\u2019s East India Bill (1783). These printed speeches,\nthough anchored to specific occasions, and certainly intended to have\na practical effect in British politics, were also meant to embody\nBurke\u2019s thought in a durable form. In that respect, they\nparallel his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770), and Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790),\namongst other non-oratorical writings. Burke\u2019s activity as a parliamentarian and political writer\nembraced a great many concerns. Prominent amongst these were the\nproblems of British rule overseas, in North America, India and\nIreland. His name, however, has been linked most strongly by posterity\nto a critique of the French Revolution of 1789. Burke was certainly\nmore notable as a pundit than an executive politician. He held\nnational office only twice, for a few months in 1782 and 1783. His\npolitical life was punctuated in May, 1791 by a break from certain of\nhis party colleagues over the significance of the Revolution.\nThereafter, assisted not least by the turn the Revolution took in\n1792\u20133, he became a largely independent commentator on domestic\npolitics and international affairs in An Appeal from the New to\nthe Old Whigs (1791), Letters on a Regicide Peace (1795\u20137), and A Letter to a Noble Lord (1796). Burke in\nhis last years, especially from 1792, also turned his attention to his\nnative Ireland. He failed to found a political dynasty, and he left no\nlasting school in parliamentary politics: the last politician who can\nbe regarded plausibly as a disciple, the addressee of A Letter to\nWilliam Elliot (1795), died in 1818. As Sidgwick observed in the\n1870s, \u2018though Burke lives, we meet with no Burkites\u2019\n(Sidgwick 1877 [2000, 195]). Nor did Burke bequeath a straightforward\nlegacy to any political party or to any ideological brand of thought,\nthough plenty have tried to appropriate him wholly or partly. The\ndifficulties that they might encounter in colonising his thought are\napparent from an account of it that emphasizes its philosophical\naspects."

      "snippet": "This has led certain critics to accuse him of &quot;conservatism&quot; insofar as he appears to be ignoring, and thereby tacitly validating, the intellectual or political power structures that determine what counts as traditional, what it means to belong to a tradition, etc. On the other hand, there are those who charge him with undermining the possibility for truth in interpretation, inasmuch as understanding is determined by the &quot;prejudices&quot; of the interpreter and is thus inherently subjective or relative. In the former case, the claim is that Gadamer&#x27;s account of hermeneutical reflection merely involves the appropriation of what is simply &quot;given&quot; to us by tradition, and that he does not provide any room for critique.",

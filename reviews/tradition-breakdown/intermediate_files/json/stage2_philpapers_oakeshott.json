While Hayek ends up recommending a limited state across contexts and cultures, Scott\u2019s work celebrates the unorganized order that emerges from below. Michael Oakeshott\u2019s critique, in comparison, is comprehensively anti-doctrinal since it is part of a wider philosophy that not only critiques doctrinal interventions in practical life, but also warns against the limitations of practical world view.",

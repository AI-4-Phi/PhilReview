      "abstract": "Based on the discussion of Hannah Arendt's authority and conservation in education, this paper aims to diagnose the reality that the current teaching authority is weakening and to explore the direction in which the authority of education should be directed. Hannah Arendt's authority is related to tradition. As traditions closely related to authority are weakened and dismantled, the authority of education in schools with an intermediate character between the private and public spheres is also weakening, and Hannah Arendt's conservatism in education, as stated in \u2018The crisis in education\u2019, argues that teachers should take responsibility for the world and children and play the essential role of education based on the authority that can be taught based on the nature of education, which is raising children and preserving traditions.",

      "abstract": "In this paper I discuss two attempts to challenge mainstream liberal education, by Hannah Arendt and by contemporary Israeli philosopher Hanan Alexander. Arendt and Alexander both identify problems in liberal-secular modern politics and present alternatives based on reconnecting politics and education to tradition. I analyze their positions and bring them into a dialogue that suggests a complex conception of education that avoids many of the pitfalls of modern liberal thought. First, I outline Arendt and Alexander\u2019s educational views and discuss their similarities, arguing that both may be understood as opposed to the modern attempt to adopt a \u00abview from nowhere\u00bb at the world. Next, I suggest that Alexander\u2019s view may benefit from adopting Arendt\u2019s conceptions of tradition and authority. In the consecutive section, I argue that Alexander sheds light on significant problems in Arendt\u2019s approach to education, problems his understanding of critical dialogue can help solve. The succeeding section joins the two views together to form an approach I call \u00abcritical traditionalism\u00bb, and examines it against prevailing approaches to political education. I conclude by pointing to an important point overlooked by both Arendt and Alexander, namely the need for internal political struggle within each tradition.",

      "abstract": "Augustine and Mozi are doubtlessly two of the most important theorists about love in the Western and Chinese traditions. Augustine has made a sharp distinction between caritas and cupiditas, whereas Mozi proposes the theory of impartial love (jian\u2019ai \u517c\u7231). Hannah Arendt has made her irreplaceable contribution to the understanding of the Augustinian concept of caritas in her work with the title Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin, Versuch einer Philosophischen Interpretation (1929). She treats the central question of whether for Augustine love towards neighbors has an independent value. In the Chinese tradition, Mozi proposes the theory of impartial love as a remedy for disposing of the disorders of society on the one hand, but on the other hand to love others impartially comes ultimately from the divine command of tian or Heaven, and tian seems to be the final authority or standard for being morally good and righteousness. It needs explanation or clarification if Mozi commits an inconsistency by holding two different ethical principles. In this article, I will first concentrate on discovering the fundamental characteristics of caritas and cupiditas, and then turn to dealing with the problem of the instrumentalization of the others in the love towards neighbors if they are used as tools to ascend to God\u2019s love. In the last part, I will discuss the impartial love of Mozi and compare it with that of Augustine to see their distinctions and similarities. We will see that through the comparison we can obtain a better understanding of the concept of love in different traditions.",

      "abstract": "Hannah Arendt is widely known as a philosopher who attempted to rehabilitate the ancient Greek conception of politics. According to established readings of\u00a0The Human Condition, Arendt is generally regarded as a \u2018Graecophile\u2019 whose thought is underwritten by \u2018Athenian nostalgia\u2019. Arendt\u2019s sympathies for the Greeks are hard to deny: she did indeed turn to the Athenian understanding of politics in an attempt to crystallise in it the core elements of authentic politics. However, this interpretation is excessively one-sided. In Arendt\u2019s view, the greatest contribution to the understanding of politics was offered by the Romans, not the Greeks. The Romans were much better at dealing with the problem of stability, continuity and order of politics. In Arendt\u2019s view, an exclusive focus on action, spontaneity and extraordinary deeds threatens to destabilise the life of the political community. By introducing concepts such as tradition, authority, the sacredness of foundation, the law (lex), as well as the political significance of promise and forgiveness, the Romans opened up a dimension of political sedimentation which was alien to the Greeks. Political sedimentation provides safeguards, without which a sustainable political existence would become impossible.",

Because the language and thought of the Daodejing are somehow oddly foreign to the Western traditions of analytic philosophy and sinology, this study attempts to make the Daodejing more familiar by recourse to the tradition of continental philosophy, in this case by taking recourse to Hannah Arendt and in particular to her seminal essay on authority. Engaging Arendt\u2019s understanding of authority, this study offers a new look at the thought of the Daodejing by discussing issues that lie at the heart of its political vision, including natural versus political authority, power and coercion, and the relation between authority, tradition, and religion. This study also attempts to situate the fate of the Daodejing\u2019s conception of authority in Chinese political history, and it concludes with a brief look at the contemporary comparative philosophical project that brings the Daodejing into conversation with continental philosophy.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to elaborate on the debate surrounding continuity and change in Islamic religious authority. The discussion begins by establishing a framework for understanding the analytical definition of authority before delving into the dimensions that experience continuity and change. Arendt defines authority as a relationship, signifying a connection to a specific discursive tradition, knowledge, and history. Additionally, it involves a relationship with others who may recognize, accept, or contest this connection. Building upon Arendt\u2019s definition, the article deconstructs the nature of this relationship, emphasizing three constitutive elements: the notion of a past, the connection to the foundational past, and the ability to convey and enhance that model. This includes the augmentation of the foundational past and the ability to elicit obedience without resorting to coercion. What sets authority apart is its unique capacity to foster obedience through a relationship, free from coercion. To identify the constituents of authority, the article explores the question of continuity and change in a more productive manner by focusing on each of its three constitutive elements.",

      "abstract": "Lindsay P. Cohn reads Augustine from the perspective of modern civil-military relations, analyzing how Augustine\u2019s views on order, authority, war, peace, violence, and public service help illuminate current debates about democratic control of the military, the ideal relationship between the soldier and the wider society, and the role of the military leader in policy and strategic planning.\n While Augustine never wrote a treatise on war or military service, nor indeed on political theory of any kind, his ideas about these topics form part of a centuries-old theoretical and ethical tradition with great contemporary relevance.\n Cohn explores the relevance of Augustine\u2019s thought to contemporary normative theories of civil-military relations, especially those of Huntington, Cohen, and Brooks. She then considers possible alternatives to Augustine\u2019s conservatism from the liberal, republican and other democratic theories of Locke, Rousseau, Habermas, and more. To engage with Augustine\u2019s ethical arguments about the appropriateness of political violence, Cohn draws from Clausewitz\u2019s descriptive arguments about the nature of war and how victory is achieved. Finally, Cohn looks at the modern empirical literature about the role of militaries in democratic breakdown, in an effort to sketch a military professional ethic appropriate to modern political values.\n Ultimately, Cohn highlights Augustine\u2019s moral guidance is of both practical and ethical importance; however, his assumptions about the nature of war and political authority require modification if we are to produce a usefully refined normative theory of civil-military relations.",

The analysis of the concepts under consideration began with Hannah Arendt\u2019s reflection on the relationship between authority and responsibility for the world that adults must assume. The educational difficulties that arise after accepting the philosopher\u2019s belief that the thread of tradition has been broken were also shown. Next, Lech Witkowski\u2019s original metaphor of the square of authority, inspired by Martin Heidegger\u2019s thought, was recalled and discussed. In addition, the perspective presented by Leo Strauss and his students was taken into account, in which the essence of education is to engage in dialogue with the great thinkers, the teachers of humanity. The differences and similarities between the positions of the authors cited were highlighted. The conclusions contain reflections on the role of tradition and culture in education, the importance of the figure of the master in education, and the significance of the master-student relationship.",

      "abstract": "Modern political philosophy has long been anchored in the contractarian imagination \u2014 the belief that political legitimacy arises from an agreement among individuals who surrender their natural liberty to an external sovereign. From Hobbes\u2019 Leviathan to Locke\u2019s liberal state and Rousseau\u2019s general will, the social contract tradition conceptualised order as something granted by authority rather than generated by community. This paper argues that such contractarian reasoning contains a moral flaw: it objectifies the state as an entity outside human consciousness, alienating citizens from their collective capacity to govern. Revisiting the origins of political association, I propose the idea of a \u201cnatural state\u201d \u2014 not a pre-political condition of chaos, but a moral and social order rooted in mutual trust, cooperation, and coordination. The natural state represents a form of community consciousness, where individuals constitute the state through their shared moral awareness rather than through the act of delegation. Drawing from Arendt\u2019s notion of power as people acting in concert, Foucault\u2019s concept of biopower, and Habermas\u2019 idea of communicative rationality, the paper reconstructs the origin of political authority as an expression of human sociability rather than its restraint. By reclaiming the natural state, we rediscover the ethical foundation of political life \u2014 one that situates power within the people rather than above them. The paper concludes by framing this vision as a normative ideal for reawakening community consciousness in an increasingly fragmented and technocratic world.",

To read the poem from within the British twenty first century lyric tradition is to admire the way that such tessellation creates a literary whole. What lessons can be learnt for contemporary poetics, in an era characterised arguably less by a breakdown in meaning than by a multiplication of meanings: in the multiplying sources of authority offered by identity politics, or citizen journalism; in competing public discourses; in the ramifying identities one individual may acquire as they occupy a number of social or emotional roles? If the impulse of lyric poetry is to \u201csing\u201d these into a kind of coherence, a unifying voice too often creates unifying perspective, is it possible that The Waste Land offers a counterexample?\"",

To achieve this, I will not investigate the numerous points of convergence between them, but rather analyze Arendt\u2019s concept of republic as it is found in her book On revolution. More specifically, in this article I try to elucidate the nature of the bond that ties republic and secularization in Arendt\u2019s thought. For this purpose, it will be necessary to examine the following concepts: law, power, authority and Constitution. Key words: Arendt, republic, power, authority, Constitution.",

Modernity is both a site of \"desolation\" (Doctorow's term) and a place of freedom. With the decline of authority, tradition, and religion, the modern world threatens us with meaninglessness even as its radical contingency affords the possibility of freedom, of creative actions that make a world. Juxtaposing Arendt and Doctorow's accounts of action and their understanding of the constraints upon creativity highlights two significant issues: to what extent is collective action (politics) possible under modern conditions and to what extent should creativity be guided by norms of justice. Both writers are deeply uneasy with modern individualism (including its appearance in existentialism), but struggle to find ways to articulate collective forms of action or ways to instantiate a collective norm like justice.",

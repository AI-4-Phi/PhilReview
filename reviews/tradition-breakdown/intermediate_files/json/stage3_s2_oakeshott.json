      "abstract": "This essay creates an unlikely conversation between two 20th century thinkers: John Rawls and Michael Oakeshott. I say \u201cunlikely\u201d because apart from a few scant remarks in the writing of each the two did not directly engage each other. The essay begins by examining Oakeshott\u2019s explication of \u201cThe Rationalist\u201d and her tradition in the history of political thought. Specifically, the essay shows that rationalism in politics involves the belief that reason is an infallible guide to political activity and that the Rationalist seeks certainty and perfection in political affairs. The essay goes on to tease out the rationalistic tendencies in Rawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice, and then it analyzes Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism and applies these criticisms to Rawls. Briefly, Oakeshott marks a distinction between technical and practical knowledge, and he argues that the principles that make up technical manuals like A Theory of Justice are abridgments of and no substitute for the understanding we gain through our practical experience and our participation in a given political tradition. While explaining Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism and Rawls, the essay indicates some of the relativistic proclivities in Oakeshott\u2019s appeal to political practices and traditions, and then it entertains objections to Oakeshott that a Rawlsian might offer. Here Rawls\u2019 commitment to the liberal tradition and the relativity implicit in his explanations of \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d and \u201creasonableness\u201d are examined and Rawls\u2019 similarities to Oakeshott are noted. Ultimately, this essay argues that the strength of Rawls\u2019 work lay not in the fact that his principles of justice are established by rational agents in an original position, but in the fact that they are principles that emerge from and cohere with ideas deeply rooted in the Western tradition itself.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: The contribution of this paper lies in that Oakeshott (1901\u223c1990) proposes a new view of political \nthought: the politics is the pursuit of an intimation. Method: To do this, this paper analyzed Oakeshott\u2019s \npolitical thought and his criticism on Rationalist politics. Results: This new political view can be seen as a \nparadigm instead of the traditional views of rationalist politics. And the traditional political view of rationalism \nof the West has experienced the process from \u201cthe pursuit of good politics\u201d of ancient Greece to \u201cthe pursuit of \nutilitarian politics\u201d of modern times (that is to say, virtue is no longer to be the \u201cking\u201d of the political \nphilosophy, rationality has occupied its position), the dilemma of this political view lies in the confusing of the \nproblems of \u201cfact-value distinction\u201d. For this reason, Oakeshott believes that politics is a sort of practical activity \nfor the participation in an arrangements. On one hand, the tradition of behavior is an arrangement, on the \nother hand, it is also unfinished. Conclusion: In this sense, the theory of politics is a kind of theory about the \nintimations of a tradition of behavior. Beginning from the interpretation of the political activity itself, this paper \nexamines the political view of rationalism through the analysis of the theory of intimation and its implications.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes various aspects of the interpretation of the concepts of personification of the state in modern political philosophy and political science. In particular, it is emphasized that, in purely theoretical terms, the paradoxes associated with numerous theoretical attempts to identify a \u201cpolitical personality\u201d with the state go back to the philosophy of the early modernity. In their original form, they were very clearly presented by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan and his other political writings. The immediate source of much of the theoretical debates in modern scientific and philosophical literature are the Hobbesian definitions of the personality and the state in chapters 16 and 17 of Leviathan. The authors examine in detail the complex process of analytics of the Hobbesian legacy in the works of M. Oakeshott, Q. Skinner, D. Runciman, F. Pettit, A. Abizadeh, D. Gauthier, B. Holland, S. Fleming and other scientists and political theorists, focusing especially on the continuity between Hobbesian political philosophy and ancient tradition (Plato, Aristotle, Thucydides, Roman Stoics). A number of complex issues related to the interpretation of the personification of the state in modern political philosophy and international political theory are studied in detail. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of theoretical discussions between supporters of political realism and constructivism (N. G. Onuf A. Wendt, F. Kratochwil, R. Schuett, R. Pettman, R. Oprisko, K. Kaliher, etc.).",

      "abstract": "One of the best known aspects of Oakeshott\u2019s philosophy is his critique of rationalism. Because it is often read in a manner that dissociates it from the larger milieu in which it subsists, namely, Oakeshotts\u2019s philosophy of experience, Oakeshott is sometimes labeled as an enemy of politics, one who is uninterested in political affairs; or, again, as a conservative, one who is at odds with modernity. Yet it remains to be seen whether these labels do justice to the complexity of Oakeshott. Indeed, if Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism is inserted into the background of his philosophy of experience as articulated in Experience and its Modes, we begin to see that Oakeshott\u2019s concern in his critique of rationalism is to separate political activity from political theorization and ground ideology in tradition, so that with a bit of detachment from political experience, the philosopher of politics can assume philosophy\u2019s oversight function in critically interrogating the assumption behind political activity and political theorization, with a view to underscoring the limits of ideological politics and the priority of tradition. Our contention is that this way of looking at Oakeshott\u2019s critique of the sovereignty of reason allows for a better appreciation of the contemporary relevance of Oakeshott\u2019s contributions to political discourse.",

      "abstract": "In this book, Peter Ahrensdorf explores an overlooked but crucial role that Homer played in the thought of Plato, Machiavelli, and Nietzsche concerning, notably, the relationship between politics, religion, and philosophy; and in their debates about human nature, morality, the proper education for human excellence, and the best way of life. By studying Homer in conjunction with these three political philosophers, Ahrensdorf demonstrates that Homer was himself a philosophical thinker and educator. He presents the full force of Plato's critique of Homer and the paramount significance of Plato's achievement in winning honor for philosophy. Ahrensdorf also makes possible an appreciation of the powerful concerns expressed by Machiavelli and Nietzsche regarding that achievement. By uncovering and bringing to life the rich philosophic conversation among these four foundational thinkers, Ahrensdorf shows that there are many ways of living a philosophic life. His book broadens and deepens our understanding of what a philosopher is.",

Drawing on archival material, it argues that Rawls's fascination with tradition arose out of his own pedagogical engagement with the debate around the \u201cdeath of political philosophy\u201d in the 1950s. Throughout, I highlight the significance of Rawls's teaching\u2014beginning with his earliest lectures on social and political philosophy at Cornell, to his shifting views on \u201cthe tradition\u201d in his published works, culminating in the increasingly contextually minded and irenic approach on display in Political Liberalism (1993) and Justice as Fairness. This neglected aspect of the \u201chistorical Rawls\u201d offers insight into how Rawls himself might have read \u201cJohn Rawls\u201d as a figure in the history of political thought\u2014and reveals that he spent a lot more time contemplating that question than one might think.",

It elaborates their normative perspectives on three themes: the relevance of tradition to modernity, the appropriate form of democracy as means of legitimating political power in Africa, and the relative status of person and community; it also reflects on the significance of these themes in postcolonial African social and political philosophical discourse. The chapter then points out points of convergence and divergence among these individuals and how they relate with Western philosophical perspectives and argues that their work configures a coherent discourse that justifies joining them in a tradition of Ghanaian political philosophy.",

This reflects the significant disconnect between Oakeshott\u2019s political philosophy in On Human Conduct and his philosophy of education. Central to this philosophy is the cultivation of individuality. This character trait is required to enjoy a fulfilling life and to participate in civil association. The primary thesis of this essay is that the state must provide the resources to allow the poor the opportunity to acquire and exercise their individuality. The secondary thesis is that the extent to which such intervention is realistic or appropriate should not be exaggerated.",

      "abstract": "Modern digital political philosophy occupies a special place among socio-humanitarianism in the chosen aspect of the study, as it is a new teaching and research area. This is due to the fact that its field includes the study of the creation and changes in the rules that regulate all spheres of social life, including theoretical and methodological support and practical everyday life. In the XXI century there has been an aggravation of contradictions between the intensive transformations taking place and the measured course of life. On the one hand, these are the values of changing the future, and on the other hand, the values of preserving the past, i.e., tradition and innovation. Modern man has enormous opportunities both to change the world and himself. The aim of the article is to explore the scientific-theoretical model of contemporary digital political philosophy by means of systematisation and analysis of the main approaches that reflect contemporary political-philosophical debates. The main method of research is historical and cultural analysis of contemporary problems in the field of artificial intelligence facing political philosophy. The viewpoint that digital political methodology for the science of the future will be of predominant importance is gradually being established in the world. The theoretical relevance of the study lies in the fact that it offers an example of digital methodological analysis, which can become a toolkit, with its help it is possible to develop in the future an interdisciplinary approach in the management of modern political problems in the field of artificial intelligence facing society. The practical relevance is that this study can be used in the educational process at the university level, as digital political philosophy will be able to supplement the academic level of students with a general understanding of what digitalisation in politics is and in what areas its application is necessary. It is concluded that digital political philosophy is the basis for the future revolution of neural networks, basic political science problems are performed by artificial intelligence much faster and better than real political actors, axiological agenda as well as multimedia content are also created unaided.",

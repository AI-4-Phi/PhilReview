      "abstract": "This article traces the Marxist debate on the concept of \u2018bourgeois revolution\u2019 and criticises attempts within orthodox Marxism to salvage the concept in the face of the historiographical revisionist critique. It then introduces into the Anglo-American tradition of Political Marxism and argues that while scholars of this orientation have presented a powerful renewal of Marxism and re-interpretation of late medieval and early modern history, they have failed to systematically incorporate international relations into their reconstructions of early modern revolutions and state-formations. The article demonstrates how the international played a crucial role in shaping the respective trajectories of national developments, exemplified with reference to England and France, and concludes by arguing the case for a theoretical re-integration of the role of international relations into Marxist Historical Sociology.",

      "abstract": "How should Marxist social analysis relate to bourgeois social science? The obvious answer is: retain and develop what is valuable, criticize and reject what is worthless. Marxist social science has followed the opposite course, however. By assimilating the principles of functionalist sociology, reinforced by the Hegelian tradition, Marxist social analysis has acquired an apparently powerful theory that in fact encourages lazy and frictionless thinking. By contrast, virtually all Marxists have rejected rationalchoice theory in general and game theory in particular. Yet game theory is invaluable to any analysis of the historical process that centers on exploitation, struggle, alliances, and revolution.",

      "abstract": "The French Revolution was central to the emergence of modern society, and by extension, modern social science. However, not only French scientists contributed to the invention of sociology, nor for that matter did sciences necessarily begin by emulating natural science. Instead, this paper argues for a different origin of sociology from the professional faculty of Law. This trajectory emerged in early nineteenth century Germany, not in emulation of the French Revolution, but as part of a broader conservative reaction to French rationalism and imperial hypocrisy. Understanding these origins not only help us better understand the familiar sociology of Max Weber, or even Marx and Durkheim who were trained in this legal scientific tradition; this historical understanding reveals an important relationship between sociology and the State as well as conservative politics.",

      "abstract": "Although the triggering effect of economic crises on revolt is a classic sociological topic, crises have until recently mostly triggered large-scale collective action in developing countries. The antigovernment protests that occurred in several European countries in the aftermath of the global financial crisis brought crises to the forefront of collective action research in democratic societies, as well as provide important opportunities for studying how crises can trigger large-scale collective action. This volume focusses on Iceland's 'Pots and Pans Revolution', a series of large scale antigovernment protests and riots that took place in Iceland in autumn 2008 and January 2009. The Icelandic case offers a rare opportunity to study processes that can trigger political protest in an affluent, democratic society. The protests took place in the aftermath of a national financial collapse triggered by the global financial crisis in early October 2008. While having almost no tradition of mass protest, Iceland was among the first countries to respond to the global crisis with large-scale protest. The level of public mobilization was exceptionally high (about 25 percent participation rate) and the protests did not stop until they had brought down the ruling government of Iceland. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this volume situates the protest in historical-cultural context and applies social movement theory to explore how the economic crisis ended up triggering the protests, thus providing a step toward understanding why the global financial crisis has triggered public unrest in other countries.",

It is based on a systematic review of original data-based quantitative research published in peer-reviewed journals between 1872 and 2010, including a few seminal articles published since 2010. First, I provide a brief historical background to set the stage. Then I review research on R/S and mental health, examining relationships with both positive and negative mental health outcomes, where positive outcomes include well-being, happiness, hope, optimism, and gratefulness, and negative outcomes involve depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, delinquency/crime, marital instability, and personality traits (positive and negative). I then explain how and why R/S might influence mental health. Next, I review research on R/S and health behaviors such as physical activity, cigarette smoking, diet, and sexual practices, followed by a review of relationships between R/S and heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, immune functions, endocrine functions, cancer, overall mortality, physical disability, pain, and somatic symptoms. I then present a theoretical model explaining how R/S might influence physical health. Finally, I discuss what health professionals should do in light of these research findings and make recommendations in this regard.",

Three meta-analyses synthesized a total of 182 effects of perceived injustice, efficacy, and identity on collective action (corresponding to these socio-psychological perspectives). Results showed that, in isolation, all 3 predictors had medium-sized (and causal) effects. Moreover, results showed the importance of social identity in predicting collective action by supporting SIMCA's key predictions that (a) affective injustice and politicized identity produced stronger effects than those of non-affective injustice and non-politicized identity; (b) identity predicted collective action against both incidental and structural disadvantages, whereas injustice and efficacy predicted collective action against incidental disadvantages better than against structural disadvantages; (c) all 3 predictors had unique medium-sized effects on collective action when controlling for between-predictor covariance; and (d) identity bridged the injustice and efficacy explanations of collective action. Results also showed more support for SIMCA than for alternative models reflecting previous attempts at theoretical integration. The authors discuss key implications for theory, practice, future research, and further integration of social and psychological perspectives on collective action.",

A great deal of empirical research speaks to the policy influence of one or another set of actors, but until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions against each other within a single statistical model. We report on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues. Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.",

Some argue that young people pick up these key skills and competencies on their own by interacting with popular culture; but the problems of unequal access, lack of media transparency, and the breakdown of traditional forms of socialization and professional training suggest a role for policy and pedagogical intervention.This report aims to shift the conversation about the \"digital divide\" from questions about access to technology to questions about access to opportunities for involvement in participatory culture and how to provide all young people with the chance to develop the cultural competencies and social skills needed. Fostering these skills, the authors argue, requires a systemic approach to media education; schools, afterschool programs, and parents all have distinctive roles to play.The John D. and Catherine T.

      "abstract": "The complex interactions between hermeneutics and the social sciences can be simpli\ufb01ed historically into two anti-positivist waves: one in the mid-nineteenth century,\nrunning into the early twentieth, and the other in the mid-to-late twentieth. This is\nthe case at least in Europe; in North America, the pragmatist tradition which fed\ninto symbolic interactionism was both more continuous across the two centuries\nand also less preoccupied with anti-positivism and what has been called \u2018methodological dualism\u2019: the insistence on the di\ufb00erences between natural and social science\n(Bernstein 1992; Helle 2005; Aiken 2006).\nThe story, like the term \u2018sociology\u2019 (the most prominent of the emergent socialsciences in this connection) begins essentially with Comte (1798-1857). Comte\u2019s\npositivism, like the twentieth-century version, had a model of the unity of the\nsciences but, unlike later positivism, was not reductionist. However, sociology, the\nqueen of the sciences for Comte and the last to ascend to the positive stage, was,\nlike the other sciences, oriented to prediction and control: \u2018savoir pour prevoir, a\ufb01n\nde pouvoir\u2019. Early hermeneutic approaches to history and the (other) social sciences\ntook shape in opposition to positivism.\nSchleiermacher\u2019s consolidation of hermeneutics in a systematic form establishedthe term understanding (Verstehen), which has survived as standard usage in Englishlanguage social science discourse, and made it central to interpretation \u2013 understood\nas a more systematic activity. Schleiermacher\u2019s contribution was made the central\nand culminating point of the account of \u2018the rise of hermeneutics\u2019 given by Wilhelm\nDilthey (1833-1911), with whom hermeneutics becomes central to the self-de\ufb01nition\nof what he called the human sciences or Geisteswissenschaften. In these sciences, as\nDilthey put it, the mental activity of humans and of some other animals, and its\nproducts, can be understood. Dilthey and his contemporary, the philosopher of\nhistory J.G. Droysen (1808-84) developed what we would now call a research programme for history and the other human sciences based on the distinctiveness of\nhuman psychic expressions and the understanding of those expressions. In a move\nwhich was to become a de\ufb01nitional feature of later interpretive social science,\nDilthey, like Schleiermacher, emphasised the continuity between everydayunderstanding and more formal processes of interpretation. His distinction between\nthe natural and human sciences was developed in large part in opposition to\nComtean positivism, which had become in\ufb02uential, even in the German-speaking\ncountries, by the middle of the nineteenth century.\nIn a parallel but more methodological formulation, two other neo-Kantian thin-kers, Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert, argued that the study of culture is\nessentially concerned with individual processes and relating them to shared human\nvalues, whereas the natural sciences are concerned with general laws about objects\nwhich are essentially remote from questions of value. We are interested, for example, in the French Revolution not just as a member of a class of revolutions exhibiting certain common features (this would be, for Rickert, a natural-scienti\ufb01c mode\nof approaching it), but as a unique event embodying, and perhaps also violating,\ncertain crucial human values.1",

This article synthesizes and extends a suite of conceptual frameworks, research findings, and practice-based knowledge into an integrative framework for collaborative governance. The framework specifies a set of nested dimensions that encompass a larger system context, a collaborative governance regime, and its internal collaborative dynamics and actions that can generate impacts and adaptations across the systems. The framework provides a broad conceptual map for situating and exploring components of cross-boundary governance systems that range from policy or program-based intergovernmental cooperation to place-based regional collaboration with nongovernmental stakeholders to public-private partnerships. The framework integrates knowledge about individual incentives and barriers to collection action, collaborative social learning and conflict resolution processes, and institutional arrangements for cross-boundary collaboration. It is presented as a general framework that might be applied to analyses at different scales, in different policy arenas, and varying levels of complexity. The article also offers 10 propositions about the dynamic interactions among components within the framework and concludes with a discussion about the implications of the framework for theory, research, evaluation, and practice.",

The underlying assumption, amply supported by recent literature, is that there is a wide but not infinite variety of modes of institutional change that can meaningfully be distinguished and analytically compared. It is also assumed that an empirically grounded typology of institutional change that does justice to the complexity and versatility of the subject can offer important insights on mechanisms of social and political stability and evolution generally.",

Other studies analyze how the state grants or withholds minority rights and faces ethnic protest and rebellion accordingly, while largely overlooking the ethnic power configurations at the state's center. Drawing on a new data set on Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) that identifies all politically relevant ethnic groups and their access to central state power around the world from 1946 through 2005, the authors analyze outbreaks of armed conflict as the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power. The findings indicate that representatives of ethnic groups are more likely to initiate conflict with the government (1) the more excluded from state power they are, especially if they have recently lost power, (2) the higher their mobilizational capacity, and (3) the more they have experienced conflict in the past.",

Adopting an ethnographic and hermeneutic methodology, the present paper draws upon our experiences as lecturers in Research Methods over many years, and upon pertinent literature to explain the meaning of research paradigm. The paper elucidates the key aspects of research paradigms that researchers should understand well to be able to address this concept adequately in their research proposals. It offers suggestions on how researchers can locate their research into a paradigm and the justification needed for paradigm choice.

      "abstract": "Oppositional intellectualism as reflection, not rejection, of power:Wits Sociology, 1975-1989 Shireen Ally (bio) Intellectuals and power: explaining South African sociologists' critique of apartheid The history of sociology in South Africa and its relationship to apartheid is turbulent and complex. At first, intellectuals were intimately related to power, as sociologists were in direct conversation with the administrative and political interests of the recurring racially repressive regimes. Sociologists assisted in segregationism's 'native administration' and 'social planning', and then became key apartheid ideologues (Jubber 1983, Groenewald 1991). Hendrik F Verwoerd, South African prime minister and the widely-recognised architect of apartheid, was South Africa's first Professor of Sociology, concerned with proactively planning and organising social relations. Geoffrey Cronj\u00e9, the 'mind of apartheid' (Coetzee 1991) was also a prominent Professor of Sociology, who effectively provided 'the first comprehensive fundamental exposition of the apartheid idea' (Rhoodie and Venter 1960:174). Sociologists were key members of the Suid-Afrikaanse Bond vir RasseStudies, and the Afrikaner Broederbond, which were some of the pivotal institutions in which the apartheid concept was developed, refined, and popularised (Ally, Mooney, and Stewart 2003). Sociologists were therefore at the centre of attempts to theorise and activate the racial, cultural, and economic ideas that birthed the project of apartheid. By the 1970s, however, sociologists' relationship to the political and social order changed dramatically. Ideological intellectualism was overtaken and replaced by a dramatically different, oppositional Marxist sociology. Harold Wolpe (1972), Martin Legassick (1974), and other historians launched a revolutionary critique of apartheid through a thorough revisionist [End Page 66] history of South Africa (see also Johnstone 1976; Trapido 1971). They theorised and demonstrated racial discrimination in South Africa to be rooted in the structural requirements of its capitalist economy. An entire generation of South African scholars in history, political studies, anthropology, and sociology, embraced the Marxism introduced to them by these revisionist scholars, and began systematic critiques of apartheid, showing its genesis to be located in the class interests of Afrikaner and English capitalists, and consequently advocating a class revolution to restore justice to South African society. This radical Marxist social science overtook the existing sociologies at English-medium universities, reconstructing the relationship between sociologists and the apartheid state. Forging direct and revolutionary links with the emerging social movements, sociologists became agents of revolutionary change. The vibrant and engaged 'public sociology' that resulted has garnered much valorising attention lately, inspiring Burawoy to a reflexive re-engagement with mainstream sociological practice in the United States (Burawoy 2004). While Burawoy documents and celebrates this 'public sociology' of the 1980s, the genesis of the 'critical sociology' of the 1970s that laid the basis for it, is not analysed.1 How did this oppositional intellectualism emerge out of a discipline whose historical role was to service the interests of the apartheid state; and what explains its content and spread? This paper argues that the general theoretical literature on intellectuals and power, and the specific literature that explores that relationship in South Africa both assume that oppositional intellectualism is the rejection of power, made possible by freedom from its constraints. By reconceptualising power, and re-examining the case of the shift to a Marxist oppositional sociology in the 1970s in South Africa, through an analysis of the Sociology Department at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), this paper argues that the radical intellectualism of the 1970s was a reflection of power, not the rejection of it. Explaining oppositional intellectualism In the long tradition of scholarship exploring the relationship between intellectuals and power, intellectuals are argued to either exist in a relationship of 'ideological subservience' or 'moralistic resistance' to state authority. Some scholars have understood oppositional intellectualism as the natural role, function, and tendency of intellectuals. Intellectuals have been theorised [End Page 67] as engaged in a 'disinterested love and search for truth and justice' (Benda 1969:19), to be 'disturbers of the peace' (Havel 1985), those who 'speak truth to power' (Said 1994), those in the 'humble and courageous service of truth' (Silone 1960:261), etc. 'Much of the analytic literature dealing with intellectuals', conclude Lipset and Basu, has emphasised the 'inherent antipathy between intellectuals and the powers throughout modern history' (1976:112). This tradition...",

During the last few decades, the use of qualitative research has been increased in many institutions. It can be used to explore several areas of human behavior for the development of organizations. The purpose of this study is to provide inspirations to the new researchers for the development of their qualitative articles. The paper analyzes the design of qualitative research giving some methodological suggestions to make it explicable to the reader. In this paper an attempt has been taken to study the background of the qualitative research methodologyin social sciences and some other related subjects, along with the importance, and main features of the study.",

If we look for a precise definition of qualitative research, and specifically for one that addresses its distinctive feature of being \"qualitative,\" the literature is meager. In this article we systematically search, identify and analyze a sample of 89 sources using or attempting to define the term \"qualitative.\" Then, drawing on ideas we find scattered across existing work, and based on Becker's classic study of marijuana consumption, we formulate and illustrate a definition that tries to capture its core elements. We define qualitative research as an iterative process in which improved understanding to the scientific community is achieved by making new significant distinctions resulting from getting closer to the phenomenon studied. This formulation is developed as a tool to help improve research designs while stressing that a qualitative dimension is present in quantitative work as well. Additionally, it can facilitate teaching, communication between researchers, diminish the gap between qualitative and quantitative researchers, help to address critiques of qualitative methods, and be used as a standard of evaluation of qualitative research.",

      "abstract": "Continuity and change are the two major trends that mark and media vistas today. While continuity is the result of more than a century of and media tradition, change is brought about by technological convergence, the evolution of globalization and commercial markets and of artistic and aesthetic norms, and the ever-expanding cultural borders of Europe. Bringing together eighteen research-based analyses on topics as diverse as itself, Shifting Landscapes: Film and Media in Context presents various accounts of filmic and televisual media, text and form, mediated politics, media policy, globalization, diasporic media, multiculturalism and more. The chapters are grouped into three main sections: Identities, Borders, Industries; Migration, Space, Transnationality; and Telling Stories: Medium, Form, Message and Beyond. Employing studies, critical social theory and cultural studies and drawing upon technological, spatial, political economic, sociological and anthropological approaches, the authors present multidimensional and multi-faceted depictions of the historical and contemporary factors that have shaped, and continue to shape, and media in Europe. Ambitious in both its intellectual and geographical scope, this volume provides us with an innovative and original understanding of what is happening in the and rapidly changing cinema scene - a very welcome intervention in an important cultural agenda. Kevin Robins, City University, London Miyase Christensen and Nezih Erdogan have edited an excellent book on and media landscapes in the new of the early twenty-first century. Incorporating eighteen individual chapters in three parts, the book re-examines what European media and cinema means during a period in which the geographical and cultural boundaries of Europe are still shifting, the media themselves are deeply influenced by the digital revolution, and audiences for film are constantly re-defining themselves. The book itself offers fresh perceptions across a range of different fields and should be of interest to all those fascinated by current trends in both and media.

      "abstract": "This article questions the fashionable ideas that bureaucratic organization is an obsolescent, undesirable, and non-viable form of administration and that there is an inevitable and irreversible paradigmatic shift towards market- or network-organization. In contrast, the paper argues that contemporary democracies are involved in another round in a perennial debate and ideological struggle over what are desirable forms of administration and government: that is, a struggle over institutional identities and institutional balances. The argument is not that bureaucratic organization is a panacea and the answer to all challenges of public administration. Rather, bureaucratic organization is part of a repertoire of overlapping, supplementary, and competing forms coexisting in contemporary democracies, and so are market-organization and network-organization. Rediscovering Weber's analysis of bureaucratic organization, then, enriches our understanding of public administration. This is in particular true when we (a) include bureaucracy as an institution, not only an instrument; (b) look at the empirical studies in their time and context, not only at Weber's ideal-types and predictions; and (c) take into account the political and normative order bureaucracy is part of, not only the internal characteristics of \u201cthe bureau.\u201d",

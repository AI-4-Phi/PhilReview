      "abstract": "Alasdair MacIntyre, who does not see tradition as a dead concept, but evaluates it as an argument that has expanded historically and socially embodied in terms of methodology, asserts that the rational virtue tradition created by Aristotle, a figure that unites the predecessor and the successor of a very ancient tradition should be revived in order to overcome the moral and socio-political problems of the contemporary world. According to MacIntyre, the consistent and rational basis that moral philosophy has lost in the process of about three centuries due to liberal individualism can be restored by the Aristotelian tradition. This study deals with MacIntyre's analysis of the problems of modern moral philosophy, which interprets the tradition in question has an understanding of the teleological human nature and the essence that determines the real purpose of man.",

      "abstract": "Alasdair MacIntyre marks liberalism as a key opponent standing in opposition to an Aristotelian virtue ethics framework, and of the ability of communities to base a way of life around virtues centered upon man\u2019s telos and what makes a good human life. This paper will argue that this does not need to be the case by citing how classical liberal political aims of decentralization of power and federalism can promote the efforts of communities attempting to build a culture with a focus on inculcating virtue through the lens of an Aristotelian sense of telos. MacIntyre himself acknowledges the vast differences in definitions of the virtues across cultures throughout history, and how there is unlikely to be any moral consensus. This paper will look at examples from the United States of America\u2019s early history, as well as the modern example of the European Union, to illustrate samples of societies inculcating and guarding a traditional worldview within a decentralized political environment. The liberal political aim of decentralization of power provides more autonomy to local communities, including allowing those communities to build their own culture with a focus on forming a society interested in answering the question of what a good human life consists of. This paper will argue that it is precisely the liberal individualism that MacIntyre decries as a foe to Aristotelian teleology that provides an avenue for those interested in restoring Aristotelian virtue ethics to thrive.",

This work brings MacIntyre into extended conversation with historians such as Brian Tierney and Charles Reid as well as with postcolonial thinkers and theologians such as Edward Said and Willie James Jenning, demonstrating that each has something to say to MacIntyre about the limits of virtue\u2019s vision. MacIntyre\u2019s readings of historical theologians, including Ockham and Vitoria, are brought into question, with each being shown to demonstrate how rights can act to complete, rather than undermine MacIntyre\u2019s program. What emerges is a MacIntyrean understanding of rights in which they act as historically discerned constraints against the excesses of institutional power.",

Leavis, Denys Thompson, L. C. Knights, D. W. Harding, and W. H. Mellers, among others. In recasting Scrutiny's critique of mass culture by way of Alisdair MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981), I hope to show that the Scrutiny project not only dramatizes the conflicts internal to emotivism, but also opens the way to a practice of criticism with deep ties in a communitarian rather than socialist politics.",

It then gives an account of his project of a politics of local community. The article argues that MacIntyre\u2019s critique is a Thomist moral and political project, which understands the relation of the individual to the community in ways difficult to reconcile with the contemporary conception of the person, of individual rights and of the relation of the individual to the state.",

MacIntyre introduces the idea of narrative in After Virtue, as part of his theory of virtue, after the concept of practice and before the concept of tradition. The representation of human life in narrative terms brings to the fore the longstanding relationship between philosophy and literature. In the following text I will try to examine the concept of the narrative structure of human life as it was first presented in After Virtue and demonstrate its continuity in MacIntyre\u2019s later work. In this context, I will attempt, first, to examine whether MacIntyre\u2019s idea of narrative can provide a basis for the unity of human life and action and, second, to identify its main differences from theories that emphasize fragmentation and see life as a series of disconnected events and interpretations challenging the notions of coherence and unity.",

My aim here is to clarify and assess the overall shape of the book\u2019s main argument in part I. In concluding, I turn more briefly to Kim\u2019s account (in part II of his book) of how Confucian values such as filial piety may lend a distinctive shape to law, especially criminal law, in East Asia. Part I of Democracy After Virtue focuses on democratic theory, and consists of extended critical commentary on the work of other political theorists. This includes scholars whose work is influenced by Confucianism, including Confucian meritocrats (especially Daniel A. Bell, but also Tongdong Bai), Confucian communitarian democrats (\u201cinspired by John Dewey as much as Confucius\u201d),1 and Confucian moral perfectionists (Joseph Chan). The book also engages Western democratic theorists (including Thomas Christiano and Corey Brettschneider) on themes such as the relationship between the procedural and substantive aspects of democracy, and state neutrality. Kim develops his own position through criticisms of these alternatives. Here I try to reconstruct the book\u2019s main argument without the commentary. Kim endorses \u201cpragmatic Confucian democracy\u201d which is a contextually and culturally specific version of the pragmatic democracy of John Dewey. He correctly emphasizes that any adequate account of democracy must Confucian Democracy in East Asia: A Discussion of Sungmoon Kim\u2019s Democracy After Virtue: Toward Pragmatic Confucian Democracy",

The first is attention to race. We argue that the contemporary academic virtue literature performs largely as a White space, failing to address virtue theory's role in the social construction of race, ignoring the rich and vibrant resources on virtue ethics alive within the Black theological tradition that long antedates Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue, and segregating the emerging literature on race and virtue from the broader discourse. The second is lack of attention to embodiment. More precisely, contemporary virtue theory, informed largely by Aristotle, Aquinas, and MacIntyre, has no conceptual space to theorize the body's role acquiring and deploying virtue and vice. To explore this nexus, we draw on racial trauma therapist Resmaa Menakem, Katie Walker Grimes, and Howard Thurman's Jesus and the Disinherited to challenge contemporary virtue theory and open new possibilities for a robustly corporate, enfleshed theological virtue ethic.",

      "abstract": "The values of liberalism, pluralism, and democratic governance are under sustained attack from right-wing Christian fundamentalists, white ethnonationalists, and economic populists. At the same time, liberal democracies are failing at cultivating and transmitting the values, wisdom, and virtues that are the perquisites for individual and collective flourishing. Liberal democracies seem increasingly unable to negotiate diverse visions of the good life rooted in regional, ethnic, racial, religious, generational, and socioeconomic differences. Aspiring autocrats and social media organizations exploit these divisions to enhance their power or profit, resulting in increased tribalization and affective polarization. Solving these problems requires a renewed understanding of human flourishing and the wisdom and virtues that make it possible. The House We Live In explores the commonalities underlying three classical approaches to virtue ethics\u2014Aristotelean, Buddhist, and Confucian\u2014to develop a flourishing-based ethics capable of addressing the problems of liberal democracies. The book examines the moral and intellectual virtues that promote flourishing, the diversity of ways in which we may flourish, and the factors all flourishing lives share. It shows how a flourishing-based ethics can serve as a corrective to the historical Western over-emphasis on individualism at the expense of community. Finally, it addresses problems in domestic and foreign policy and the difficulties in talking to each other across the political divide from a flourishing-based perspective. The book is a reaffirmation of pluralism, the liberal democratic tradition, and the necessity of a pragmatic approach to living together despite seemingly incommensurable differences.",

An Essay on Desire, Practical Reasoning and Narrative (2016). En primer lugar, realizamos un recorrido historico por las obras mas significativas en las que MacIntyre desarrolla su vision del narrativismo en primera instancia: After Virtue. A Study in Moral Theory (1981), Whose Justice, Which Rationality? (1988) y Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry. Enciclopaedia, Genealogy and Tradition (1990). En segundo lugar, intentamos explorar la reincidente problematica de la narratividad en la obra del 2016 para explicar como exhibe un agente neoaristotelico la racionalidad y como justifica sus juicios a traves de una narrativa. Ademas, exploramos por que la narrativa cobra mas protagonismo en esta obra que la nocion de tradicion y evidencia una mayor relacion con el telos de la vida humana. Tambien, senalamos una reafirmacion de la posicion macinteryana desde el aristotelismo frente a los ahora denominados expresivistas. EnglishThe aim of this article consists in analyzing Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s new approach to narrativism in his most recent work: Ethics in the Conflicts of Modernity An Essay on Desire, Practical Reasoning and Narrative (2016). In the first place, we make a historical review through the most relevant MacIntyre\u2019s Works on narrativism: After Virtue. A Study in Moral Theory (1981), Whose Justice, Which Rationality? (1988) y Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry. Enciclopaedia, Genealogy and Tradition (1990). Secondly, we explore the problem of narrativity that appears again in the work of 2016 to explain how does a Neoaristotelian agent exhibit his own rationality and how does he justify his judgements through a narrative. Also, we explore why narrative is more important than the concept of Tradition in this work and is more related to the telos of human life. Finally, we emphasize the the macintyrean position against the now called expressivists. portuguesNeste artigo, propomos analisar a nova abordagem ao narrativismo que Alasdair MacIntyre faz em seu ultimo livro: Etica nos conflitos da modernidade. Ensaio sobre Desejo, Raciocinio Pratico e Narrativa (2016). Em primeiro lugar, fizemos um tour historico pelas obras mais significativas nas quais MacIntyre desenvolve sua visao do narrativismo em primeiro lugar: After Virtue. Um estudo em teoria moral (1981), cuja justica, que racionalidade? (1988) e tres versoes rivais do inquerito moral. Encyclopaedia, Genealogy and Tradition (1990). Em segundo lugar, tentamos explorar a reincidencia problematica da narratividade no trabalho de 2016 para explicar como um agente neo-aristotelico exibe racionalidade e como ele justifica seus julgamentos por meio de uma narrativa. Tambem exploramos porque a narrativa assume mais destaque neste trabalho do que a nocao de tradicao e mostra uma relacao maior com o telos da vida humana. Tambem apontamos uma reafirmacao da posicao de macintyreana do aristotelianismo contra os agora chamados expressivistas.",

      "abstract": "The article examines the concept of subsidiarity developed in communitarian political philosophy (A. McIntyre, M. Sandel, M. Walzer, C. Taylor, D. Hollenbach, etc.) using the method of critical conceptual analysis. The conceptual structure of the communitarian concept of subsidiarity is compared with the structure of a similar concept in the liberal political and philosophical tradition. Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn. The liberal interpretation significantly distorted the original meaning of the concept of subsidiarity, first reflected in Catholic social philosophy and implemented in the practices of medieval cities. Liberalism linked the concept of subsidiarity with negative freedom, antisocial individualism, and the concept of a neutral state. This gave rise to the paradoxes of the liberal concept of subsidiarity: in order to curb the centrifugal tendencies that arise with such an institutional design, the centralizing will of the state is necessary, and the concept of subsidiarity, universal in its original design, in liberal logic turned out to be applicable only in democratic liberal states. All these problems are solved in a communitarian interpretation of subsidiarity, combining this principle with the virtues of solidarity, attachment, identity, etc.",

      "abstract": "Virtue ethics is a way of viewing the moral life in terms of the necessary dispositions which shape human action towards the good, and towards human flourishing. Thinking of the moral life in terms of virtue was the dominant approach to moral philosophy in ancient and medieval thought. Although largely absent as a major strand of thought in moral philosophy after the Enlightenment, it has key features which challenge the dominant approaches in moral philosophy. The second half of the twentieth century saw a revival in virtue ethics, inspired by philosophers such as Anscombe and MacIntyre. The Hippocratic tradition provides a virtue framework for medicine, and the revival of virtue ethics has led to further work to explore the importance of virtue in medical practice. In the morally and technically complex world of medical practice, the virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance are necessary for the doctor to act according to the best interests of the patient, which are in line with the proper ends of medicine. The law has a role in prohibiting acts which are not in accordance with the ends of medicine, which cannot be virtuous. It also has a role in helping to arrive at prudential decisions in cases where there are disputes between patients or their families and medical teams about a best course of action. Finally, medical law should have a role in cultivating virtue within medicine for the benefit of patients and doctors.",

      "abstract": "In his elaboration of \u2018practical anarchism\u2019 (\u2018practical\u2019 as in \u2018practical philosophy\u2019, i.e., ethical), Franks draws extensively on Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s virtue ethics, especially as set out in After Virtue (1981), and proposes that: \u201canarchism ... and its distinguishing characteristic of adherence to prefigurative tactics ... is best considered as a social virtue theory compatible with the format developed by MacIntyre.\u201d (p. 156) I am not an anarchist, but I am interested in the prospects for a united and effective Left, and I think Franks\u2019 proposal to found anti-capitalist politics on virtue ethics has much to offer. Franks accepts MacIntyre\u2019s concept of \u2018practices\u2019 which is close to what I call \u2018collaborative projects\u2019. In particular: \u201clike MacIntyre, they [anarchists] view the social world as being constructed out of intersecting social practices.\u201d (p. 141) MacIntyre defines a \u2018practice\u2019 as: \u201cany coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realised in the course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are appropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity.\u201d (1981, 175) and he goes on to gives examples: games like chess or football, professions such as architecture, enquiries such as physics, chemistry or history, arts such as painting and music, and the creation and sustaining of households, cities and nations. All practices are aimed at the achievement of some good. And a virtue is defined as: \u201can acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which tends to enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.\u201d (p. 178) So virtue is relative to the practice in which it is utilized. No human quality is absolutely virtuous, at least for the foreseeable future. Practices, as MacIntyre sees it, are components of a tradition. A tradition is \u201can historically extended, socially embodied argument, and an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute a tradition\u201d (p. 207).",

      "abstract": "The problem of toleration has traditionally been addressed from liberal perspectives, emphasizing the individual over the community. In contrast, postmodern thought introduces the theory of the gift, revealing the bonds erased by liberal individualism. This article proposes an alternative conceptualization of tolerance within the paradigm of the gift: tolerance as accepting the gift. The existence of the given demands tolerance of its disruptive implications: the encounter with the other and the recognition of an underlying debt. Drawing on the debate on the gift between Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida and John Milbank, I explore the social and political implications of this perspective on tolerance. I argue that radical acceptance of the gift requires abandoning the paradigm of sameness in favour of difference and recognizing the impossibility of abstractly resolving the problem of tolerance. While liberal tradition privileges individual freedom, tolerance from the perspective of the gift calls for communitarian virtues \u2013 hospitality, responsibility and forgiveness. Finally, recognizing the radical \u2018given condition\u2019 of the gift rethinks politics not from a sovereign hierarchy of power but from an anti-sovereigntist paradigm rooted in vulnerability.",

In these articles, MacIntyre criticizes changes in society transforming the physician-patient relationship: fragmentary moral views, individualism, misunderstanding of scientism and fallibility of the practice, as well as the lost background of common values and medical authority. From a teleological perspective, MacIntyre describes internal goods of medicine and physician\u2019s virtues: reliability, fairness, courage, humility and even, friendship.",

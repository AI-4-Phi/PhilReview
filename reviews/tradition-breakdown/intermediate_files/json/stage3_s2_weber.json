      "abstract": "Max Weber characterized modernity as a state of disenchantment, in which rationalization strips the world of sacred meaning. To counter political apathy, he suggested that democratic elections could generate quasi-charisma, infusing sterile bureaucratic rule with symbolic energy. This essay interrogates whether such democratic charisma can truly heal the spiritual deficit of modern life. Drawing on recent critiquesincluding Storms claim that enchantment never vanished and Marottas refined model of demagificationit argues that democratic charisma is structurally frail. While elections, media spectacles, and populist appeals may momentarily mobilize affect, they remain embedded in the very legalrational procedures that produce disenchantment. As a result, quasi-charisma offers only transient simulations of meaning that are easily routinized or manipulated. By exposing these limits, the paper illuminates the persistent tension between efficient governance and authentic collective belief, a dilemma central to contemporary populism and declining institutional distrust.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of the general pattern of the historical development of Western society, which consists in a gradual increase in the trend of rationalization. Under rationalization is understood the process of gradual replacement of random, situational, openly irrational motives of human actions into logical, predicted, wholerelevant. An understanding of the rationalization and \"disenchantment of the world\" by M. Weber explores the essence of the modernist project as a \"disenchantment\" of social relations. At the same time, \"disenchantment\" was understood by them not only as the liberation of society from the rule of magic and superstition. \"Disenchantment\" is the growth of trust in the mind, science, education, rational procedure in all manifestations of social life, which is the leading trend and the internal meaning of the entire era of modernity. The role of \"religions of salvation\" is clarified to form integral pictures of the world not only for the religious outlook, but also for the born philosophical systems. It turns out that religious rationalization was only the beginning of the universal process of rationalization of social relations. A consequence of this trend is the differentiation of value spheres and the emergence of New European social institutions: the market, law, bureaucracy etc. Modern transformations are made possible through religious rationalization and secularization. The role of scientific rationality as an educational reference point in the Enlightenment is researched. During this time the school begins to draw knowledge not from the religious tradition, but from science. The importance of religious rationalization for the emergence of modern educational institutions, including secular schools and universities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:One of the central claims of Hans Joas' The Power of the Sacred is that Weber's narrative of the disenchantment of the world is in dire need of replacement by a more viable alternative. In his view, the disenchantment narrative not only fails to function as a correct explanation for the genesis and identity of Western modernity, but has a misleading effect on theoretical developments concerning the future of religion as well. Accordingly, Joas aims to liberate academic research from the lasting and disruptive influence of Weber's views of disenchantment. Not only does he reject Weber's term 'disenchantment' as a useful and unambiguous concept, he also discards it as a correct conceptualization of a long and linear historical process.This article expresses appreciation for Joas' challenging endeavor and its deeper intentions, yet ultimately finds his interpretation of Weber untenable on both counts. It critically assesses Joas' position by examining key components of the book where his twofold argumentation is constructed and by developing an alternative interpretation. The upshot of the analysis is to argue that nuance and redefinition are far more fruitful than elimination, and that both the concept and the theory of disenchantment remain meaningful tools for academic research. In one word, while endorsing Joas' invitation for a more in-depth examination of the concept and history of disenchantment, the article defends the enduring theoretical merit of Weber's disenchantment narrative.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the concept of the world's disenchantment by M. Weber as a methodological basis for understanding modern transformations of consciousness, first of all, the deviation from the scientific picture of the world and the restoration of the magical worldview. It is shown that M. Weber considered the process of disenchanting the world in two forms: as marginalization of magical salvation practices within rationalized religious worldviews and as the assertion of ideas about the full cognizability of the world in the scientific worldview. The factor of the world's disenchantment is rationalization, as a result of which archaic syncretism is overcome, a person highlights the value orientations of \"leading a life\" and takes responsibility for one\u2019s fate. However, this is accompanied by the formalizing of the normative order and gradual loss of semantic and value dominants, with which it comes into conflict. It is proved that reverse processes occur in the modern disenchanted world, first of all, the newest syncretism develops as a result of the interpenetration of technogenic, natural, social realities, the removal of ethical antinomies. The newest \"enchantment of the world\" is also promoted by a stronger alienation and the desire to shift responsibility for one's own and common destiny onto external forces, the rejection of long-term rational life strategies and orientation to getting a quick result while paying no attention to mechanisms for achieving it. In addition, the absence of semantic and value dominants in modern culture is made up for by an archaic belief in extraordinary phenomena capable of solving the most acute problems quickly and efficiently, in the image and likeness of modern technologies.",

The aim of the article is to return to Weber\u2019s text and analyze Weber\u2019s use of the term and the meaning of what he calls the \u201cdisenchantment of the world.\u201d To do so I follow Taylor\u2019s and Schluchter\u2019s insight and investigate how Weber would picture an initial condition of enchantment. However, while these interpreters did not explore the Weberian perspective on magic, I instead show that not only Weber had a precise and original conception of magic as the primitive attitude toward the world, but also that this conception may clarify the meaning and dynamics of the process of disenchantment in both the spheres of religion and of science.",

Yet, precisely the period when the decline of organized religion hit its stride \u2013 the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 also witnessed the rise of what Ernst Troeltsch referred to as \u2018mystic religion\u2019, only now it goes by \u2018spirituality\u2019. Indeed, recent empirical studies suggest that, in addition to secularization, we are also witnessing a veritable spiritual turn. How do we explain this? We pursue this puzzle in a somewhat peculiar fashion: by turning the sociological gaze toward the lives and oeuvres of the two sociologists who have arguably played the largest roles in the development of classical secularization theory: Max Weber and Peter Berger. Addressing their theoretical contributions in tandem with their personal stances vis-\u00e0-vis religion, we argue that the standard account of secularization rests on an extremely one-sided interpretation of their legacy: it leaves out their steadfast romanticism, their deep commitments to the value of individual freedom, and, most importantly, the particular religious paths they charted. Furthermore, we contend that each of them exemplifies a way of reconciling a rationalist commitment to disenchanting science with a romantic longing for ultimate meaning, which sheds significant light on why mystical religion (or \u2018spirituality\u2019) has come to flourish in late modernity.",

      "abstract": "the standardisation of religion along neoliberal or consumerist lines. The post-secular is becoming a neoliberal post-secular, as the title suggests. The arguments that Possamai presents are thus, on the whole, fairly pessimistic. The i-zation of society signals the inexorable progress of the \u2018iron cage\u2019 and religion today, no more than in Weber\u2019s time, is offering effective resistance or a hopeful alternative. Nonetheless, throughout the presentation and then in focused fashion in the last section, the author tries to offer some hope and from time to time he muses that this i-zation may not be all bad. The prime way that he translates this hopeful pessimism is to suggest what he styles as a possible small step that global religion can take to mitigate at least the worst effects of the neoliberal regime, namely its generation of severely exacerbated and increasing global inequality. Here enters what the author offers as a \u2018global compassionate tax\u2019\u2014the idea that religions (apparently through their institutionalised forms) turn their generally tax exempt status around and voluntarily, cooperatively, transnationally, and outside formal state structures generate a vast fund, a kind of super-faith-based enterprise for equality. In other words, religions should (or could) turn precisely their neoliberal and standardised alignment with neoliberalism to the advantage of those that the system so effectively marginalises. Overall, Possamai\u2019s analysis is well-presented, coherently and frequently convincingly argued, and above all interesting. It is a speculative and mostly theoretical enterprise that illustrates its arguments very well, even though, of course, illustration is not the same as proof. It makes a solid contribution to what is indeed a much larger and very much an ongoing discussion. However, the reader does have to accept, if only provisionally, the theoretical and normative analyses of the main theoretical framers\u2014Weber, Jameson, Ritzer, and Habermas \u2014as presented by the author. And this reviewer admits that he does have a little bit of trouble doing that. However, this is a book to be recommended, if only to let an important debate continue.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the speculative potential of designing a spiritually attuned artificial intelligence platform capable of supporting processes of meaning-making, fostering conditions conducive to emotional resonance, and assisting in the discovery of intrinsic values across diverse spiritual orientations. Situated within the socio-cultural context of late modernity\u2014marked by the rationalization of life-worlds, increased individualization, and the erosion of traditional frameworks of meaning\u2014we interpret the renewed emphasis on spirituality, emotional and embodied experience, as well as interiority, as indicative of a broader re-engagement with right-hemisphere cognitive modes, as theorized by Iain McGilchrist. Rather than conceptualizing AI as a surrogate for spiritual experience or communal belonging, we explore whether this fundamentally left-hemisphere technological artifact could paradoxically be reconfigured to facilitate holistic perception, existential reflection, and prosocial engagement. Acknowledging the ethical complexities and epistemological constraints of such a vision, we propose a theoretical model for a digital interface that does not prescribe, but invites; that does not instruct, but listens. We conclude by posing a critical question: Can artificial intelligence, when sensitively designed, contribute to the re-enchantment of human experience\u2014not by transmitting meaning, but by enabling deeper forms of dialogical presence?",

      "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, much attention has been paid to the problem of disenchantment, perhaps most notably in the extensive work of Charles Taylor. This article examines the disenchantment narrative as formulated by Max Weber and appropriated by Charles Taylor, and augment this with the perspective offered by Jason Josephson-Storm and other interlocutors, to generate a reading suitable for theological use. It suggests ways in which the human person and society might be affected by disenchantment. Finally, it explores means by which prayer might be used as a resource for dealing with the causes and symptoms of disenchantment, following the example of Andrew Prevot\u2019s careful exploration of prayer as a source of Christian thought. Prevot\u2019s concept of doxological theology (\u2018thinking prayer\u2019) is particularly useful for resisting what he identifies as three crises of modernity: secularity, the fate of Western metaphysics, and socioeconomic and identity-based violence. This describes the imperative for studies in this area: insofar as the process of disenchantment contributes to the systematic violence and dehumanisation inherent in modernity, it is vital to explore the mechanics of that process and possible tools to combat it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:Until now, the ongoing debate on secularization has yielded no definite results. This is partly due to the multifaceted usage of the concept of secularization. Sometimes it is identified with disenchantment, a concept, introduced by Max Weber and applied in his comparative studies on religion since 1913. But Weber's usage is much broader than the concept of secularization suggests. Surprisingly, the concept of disenchantment is also appropriated by Charles Taylor in his seminal work A Secular Age. However, upon a closer look it turns out that his usage of the concept does not coincide with Weber's. In this article, I want to show in which regard the two authors join forces and in which they differ. The emphasis in the ensuing is on Max Weber, however, who attributed a more comprehensive meaning to the concept in distinguishing between religious and scientific disenchantment and in demonstrating, how these processes interacted historically and how they are related also to processes of reenchantment. However, in the final analysis both authors get together: Even in a secular age religion will not disappear, but the religious commitment has turned into an option, and insofar the religious situation has fundamentally changed in modernity.",

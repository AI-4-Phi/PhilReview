      "abstract": "This article first shows how an early essay of Walter Benjamin casts poetry as a transcendental mode of potential disruption that swerves away from harmful practices of politics. It then analyses how Benjamin\u2019s understanding of the political dimension of the aesthetic differs from Martin Heidegger\u2019s notion of truth as historical origin. According to Benjamin, art\u2019s as well as technology\u2019s political potential consists in a disturbance of history\u2019s continuity. By breaking the link between the work of art and the aura of its tradition and history, mechanical reproduction helps give birth to the new cosmos of poetry, whose liberating potential Benjamin celebrates in his response to a poem by Friedrich Holderlin. This article argues that Benjamin is concerned with the social impact of art but in ways different to Heidegger. Rather than subordinating art to historical forces of politics and economics, Benjamin makes us see its intrinsic revolutionary potential.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we will present Rinzai practices from Zen Masters Ikky\u016b S\u014djun (\u4e00\u4f11\u5b97\u7d14, 1394\u20131481) and Hakuin Ekaku (\u767d\u96a0 \u6167\u9db4, 1686\u20131769) as offering a distinctive kind of spiritual exercise: disruptive reorientation to transcendence (enlightenment) through immanence (a return to the world in all its ugly distractions, beauty, and insight). This paper seeks to explore Hadot\u2019s philosophy as a way of life (PWL) through Rinzai Zen\u2019s unique and often bizarre spiritual exercises. In so doing, this paper hopes to explore new grounds for PWL spiritual exercises in the eccentricities of Japanese Rinzai Zen masters whose approaches wander and diverge yet remain distinctively Rinzai in nature. In the first section, we provide some background on treating spiritual exercises in an intercultural context and explore the exemplarily disruptive spiritual exercises that Rinzai Zen offers PWL practice, especially through poetry, k\u014dans, and meditation in the midst of everyday activity. We then turn to particular examples found in the lives and spiritual practices of Ikky\u016b and Hakuin. We conclude with reflections on how Rinzai Zen and PWL inform one another through the exploration of \u201cspiritual exercise\u201d and disruption not only as scholarly pursuits but also in terms of our own arts of mindful living today.",

      "abstract": "The digital world has penetrated various corners of space and dimensions in human life. Filling in previously unimaginable gaps. Humans are now more familiar with the presence of the digital world. Suddenly, and sometimes without realizing it, a new culture and behaviour has formed, namely digital culture. Along with the emergence of new habits, new cultures, new worlds, then at least two sides are formed, the good side and the bad side. The digital world offers convenience and new opportunities. Meanwhile, on a small scale we can see humans hiding behind anonymous identities, feel free to do anything in cyberspace. This has led to a new social problem. On a national scale, the digital world requires state apparatus to adapt and prepare policy directions and legal instruments to protect national interests and their citizens. The scope of economic activity cannot be separated from the influence of the presence of the digital world. One of its influences even touched on ethics. Many studies show that companies that apply ethics get a competitive advantage compared to companies that ignore it. When the wave of disruption comes, companies also feel the dynamics and make adaptations in their business activities and operations. Also adapting related to the ethics of the company. This paper specifically tries to identify problems faced by companies due to disruption in the era of digital transformation. Mainly viewed from an ethical perspective. At the same time, it also offers a study and a view of its impact. The method used is literature study from various sources related to digital disruption, companies\u2019 ethics, and socio-cultural behaviour caused by digitization. The purpose of this paper is to find new study perspectives related to companies, social behaviour, and culture, resulting from disruption in the era of digital transformation, and the ethical side that goes with it. The digital revolution presents businesses with the challenge of leveraging technology for economic gain while navigating complex ethical issues related to human well-being, fairness, and social justice. To address these challenges, companies must adopt responsible innovation, invest in workforce development, establish ethical frameworks, and foster inclusive dialogue. Ensuring digital equity through an inclusive economy is vital, requiring a shift from profit maximization to prioritizing transparency and accountability. The findings of this study are to inspire and provide practical and strategic benefits for companies, what they must do ethically in surfing during a wave of disruption in this era of digital transformation and to increase competitive advantage and maintain sustainability. Future research should focus on adaptive strategies and policy interventions to manage technological disruptions, promoting economic growth without ethical compromises. By embracing ethical leadership and responsibility, businesses can unlock innovation, competitive advantage, and sustainability while contributing to societal good.",

      "abstract": "Advancements in medical and healthcare fields have sparked discussions within the Islamic community, particularly regarding healthcare decisions spanning birth to death. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), robotic-assisted surgery, organ transplantation, 3D bioprinting of organs, and genetically modified babies raise ethical dilemmas. Mental health issues among adolescents due to online content consumption and elderly care complexities add to these concerns. This discussion aims to address the ethical implications of modern healthcare technologies from an Islamic perspective. Supporting Islamic principles with medical progress is crucial, requiring the establishment of Bio-ethics committees guided by Islamic teachings and scholars' rulings. These committees would ensure ethical decision-making in healthcare, considering critical conditions under which these technologies can be ethically employed.",

      "abstract": "In the development of a world that is experiencing the intensity of technological disruption, which has actually broken down the boundaries of space and time, and has ceased various developments in the order of daily life. This confirms the need for a clear mindset that every development or dynamic of technology in the industrial era 4.0 is like a double-edged sword. In a sense, positive and negative impacts. The technological progress of philosophy responds back, that is, one way of doing philosophy in the midst of increasingly powerful industrial technological advances. At that point, it becomes a challenge for philosophy to carry out its function as a critic and as a contributor of constructive direction. The struggle of the 21st century is the progression of industrial technology; therefore, this reality is interesting to study/examine in such a way through a comparative approach, a reflective approach in photographing and articulating sharply \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d technology. The double face of the impact of technological disruption will ultimately remind us that \u201chumans\u201d will be the main determinant of all matters of life on this earth. \nKeywords: philosophy challenge, era of disruption, 21st century",

The purpose of this study is to explore the concepts, challenges, and critical perspectives on tradition and modernity within Islamic thought. This paper employs a literature review method with a descriptive qualitative approach, gathering data and insights from a range of references such as books, scholarly articles, journals, and other relevant sources. The results show that Islam provides a selective response based on the principle of adopting new, beneficial ideas without abandoning good old traditions. Islam encourages the use of technology for da'wah (Islamic outreach), the integration of religious curricula with science, the development of sharia economics as an alternative to capitalism, the filtering of modern ideas, and an active contribution to creating a balanced global civilization.",

      "abstract": "The philosophy of education provides a theoretical foundation for integrating traditional moral, ethical, and cultural values with the demands of innovation in the digital age. Educational technologies, such as online learning and artificial intelligence, offer excellent opportunities to expand access to learning and improve efficiency. However, reliance on technology may reduce education's personal and emotional aspects. This research aims to discuss the role of educational philosophy in bridging the balance between tradition and innovation in the era of rapidly developing technology. The method used is descriptive qualitative research with a literature study approach. The study results show that educational philosophy plays a vital role in maintaining the relevance of traditional education through the wise utilization of technology. One example of the application of this concept is blended learning, which allows technology to complement learning without eliminating direct interaction between teachers and students. In addition, educational philosophy emphasizes the importance of character development, social responsibility, and morality of students as essential aspects of education. This research concludes that the integration of tradition and technology must be balanced so that innovation does not come at the expense of the fundamental values of education. With educational philosophy as a guide, technology can enrich the learning process holistically while maintaining a balance between technological efficiency and humanist values.",

      "abstract": "Recent work on philosophy of technology emphasises the ways in which technology can disrupt our concepts and conceptual schemes. We analyse and challenge existing accounts of conceptual disruption, criticising views according to which conceptual disruption can be understood in terms of uncertainty for conceptual application, as well as views assuming all instances of conceptual disruption occur at the same level. We proceed to provide our own account of conceptual disruption as an interruption in the normal functioning of concepts and conceptual schemes. Moreover, we offer a multilevel taxonomy thereof, where we distinguish between instances of conceptual disruptions occurring at different levels (conceptual scheme, conceptual clusters, and individual\u00a0concepts), taking on different forms (conceptual gaps and conceptual conflicts), and leading to different degrees of severity (extending from mild to severe). We also provide detailed accounts through historical examples of how conceptual gaps and conceptual conflicts can occur at different times in the very same process of conceptual disruption. Finally, we make the case that different kinds of conceptual engineering can provide meaningful ways to assess and overcome distinct types of conceptual disruption.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) presents both unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges for the preservation and transmission of indigenous knowledge in Fiji and the broader Pacific region. Traditional knowledge, including oral histories, ecological practices, cultural rituals, and indigenous languages, forms the backbone of Pacific identity and resilience. However, globalization, urbanization, and environmental pressures increasingly threaten its continuity. This paper critically examines the intersection of AI and indigenous knowledge, exploring how emerging technologies can support the documentation, revitalization, and dissemination of cultural heritage while also addressing the ethical, social, and governance challenges inherent in their deployment. Through a review of contemporary literature, case studies, and regional initiatives, the study highlights the potential of AI-driven tools to enhance climate resilience, educational engagement, and intergenerational knowledge transfer. Simultaneously, it underscores critical risks, including data misappropriation, cultural misrepresentation, and the erosion of community agency, emphasizing the necessity of community-led governance frameworks. The paper concludes that ethically guided AI integration, rooted in the principles of cultural respect, digital sovereignty, and participatory collaboration, offers a transformative pathway to safeguard Pacific indigenous knowledge for future generations while harnessing the benefits of emerging technologies.",

Technology\u2014and most notably AI\u2014is used as an effective cognitive extender, which enables the extension of human personhood to include artificial elements, leading to the emergence of artificial identity. Discussing\u2014and accommodating\u2014anthropomorphization in human\u2013machine interaction should no longer be the primary focus. Rather, the scope and quality of frameworks in which the hybridization of human identity occurs and evolves has significant ethical implications that pose very pragmatic challenges to users, the industry, and regulators. This paper puts forth a few main principles upon which such a discussion should evolve. We illustrate why disruptiveness can easily turn into human harm when the frameworks facilitating it overlook the human vulnerabilities that arise from hybrid identity, notably the asymmetric and asynchronous relationship between the human and artificial counterparts. Finally, we claim that these new types of vulnerabilities, to which a person is exposed due to the intimate degree of pairing with technology, justifies introducing and protecting artificial identity as well.",

Molly Farneth's new book, The Politics of Ritual, encourages American progressives to see ritual differently. Rituals, she says, can be enacted in novel ways to serve democratic ends in the service of political and cultural transformation. But in emphasizing the transformative potential of rituals, Farneth may undersell the traditional value of rituals\u2014a value that I think should be just as important to contemporary progressives. Against the serious antidemocratic forces arrayed in the United States today, most of which speak in terms of \u201ctransformation\u201d and \u201cdisruption,\u201d progressives would do well to think of themselves as the conservators and protectors of democracy\u2014not just as radical innovators.

Involving an in-depth analysis of the Prophet's teachings regarding science and technology, this research aims to detail ethical perspectives that can guide the development and use of artificial intelligence. With an interdisciplinary approach, this research combined religious values with developments in AI technology, discussing the confluence between the traditions of the Prophet and current dynamics in the world of technology. Ethical implications from an Islamic hadith perspective were detailed, highlighting how moral and human values could be integrated into designing and implementing AI technologies. Additionally, this research explored the impact of human-AI interactions in the postmodern era, considering how AI technology could support the development of a society based on the Prophet's teachings and values. A comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence's limitations, risks, and human responsibilities was also detailed to balance technological progress and moral values. Hopefully, the research results will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between religious traditions, especially hadith teachings, and advances in AI technology, providing a solid ethical foundation for technological development in the postmodern era",

In particular, it suggests that the confluence of tectonic geopolitical changes, system-wide shifts in climate and energy, and fundamentally new developments in science and technology might lead to a rupture of the same scale as the cluster of events that heralded the onset of the current rights regime. This argument builds on a number of literatures, especially those focused on norms cycles, rights generations, and what is being called the \u201contological turn.\u201d Yet the implications extend beyond these conversations in terms of both conceptual scale (the emphasis here is on critical junctures between eras, rather than cycles or generations within eras) as well as temporal scale (the emphasis is on the medium-to-long-range future, rather than the near future). An effort to ground this speculation takes the form of testable hypotheses and practical recommendations.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of technology in the age of disruption has significantly transformed patterns of religious communication, particularly in the context of Islamic da\u2019wah. This study adopts a thematic approach to explore Qur\u2019anic-based strategies that are adaptable to digital platforms. It integrates the Islamic epistemological frameworks of bayani (textual reasoning), burhani (rational reasoning), and irfani (intuitive-spiritual reasoning) to identify core da\u2019wah principles: wisdom (hikmah), sincere exhortation (maw\u2018idzah), and respectful dialogue (muj\u0101dalah). These principles are analyzed in relation to their practical application through various forms of digital media, including social networking platforms, podcasts, and interactive video content. Relevant Qur\u2019anic verses are examined to highlight values such as communicative ethics, emotional intelligence, and contextual sensitivity, which serve as guidelines for formulating adaptive da\u2019wah strategies in the digital sphere. The findings suggest that effective digital da\u2019wah requires not only technical fluency and mastery of communication tools, but also spiritual authenticity and epistemological depth. Balancing the timeless revelatory essence of the Qur\u2019an with the adaptability required by modern media can foster communication that is inclusive, contextually relevant, and transformative. Furthermore, the research emphasizes that contemporary da\u2019wah should avoid superficial engagement by grounding messages in a holistic understanding of Qur\u2019anic guidance while utilizing creative and interactive formats. This synthesis of tradition and innovation ensures that the delivery of Islamic messages remains impactful, ethically grounded, and responsive to the needs of diverse audiences. In conclusion, digital da\u2019wah is most effective when it harmonizes the enduring wisdom of revelation with the dynamic opportunities of technological communication, thus enabling a message that resonates across both spiritual and digital landscapes.",

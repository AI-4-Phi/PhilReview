      "abstract": "The conflicting assessments of the nature and role of traditions in the modern world stem in part from differences in the use of the term; the specific phenomena that are the focus of each perspective differ in some important respects. This opens up the possibility that seemingly contradictory conclusions about the role of traditions in contemporary societies can be reconciled. The article discusses the role and influence of traditions for the analysis of the modern socio-cultural situation from the point of view of two approaches: the concept of invented tradition by Eric Hobsbawm and the concept of multiple modernities by Shmuel Eisenstadt. The purpose of the article is to give a comparative analysis of the two approaches to tradition, showing that modernity is not a culturally neutral, universal socio-cultural product, but is formed under the influence of many traditions. Based on the method of comparative analysis, it was revealed that the concept of multiple modernities by Shmuel Eisenstadt, as well as the concept of invented tradition by Eric Hobsbawm, contradict the view of the classical theory of modernization on modernity as a break with tradition. At the same time, the meaning that Eisenstadt attaches to tradition differs markedly from that proposed by E. Hobsbawm. It is concluded that from the point of view of the theory of multiple modernities, the invention of new traditions in modernity is better understood as a process of transformation, and that the reconstruction of a tradition is not the same as invention. In both cases, both for the transformation and reconstruction of the tradition, the sociocultural context is important.",

      "abstract": "Webern\u2019s String Trio, Op. 20, completed in 1927, marks his return to instrumental composition after over a decade of vocal writing (from Op. 12 to Op. 19), and also demonstrates his technical mastery of the twelve-tone method with which he had been experimenting during the preceding few years. In the absence of a text, Webern\u2019s compositional procedures adapted to the instrumental medium, and the two movements of the String Trio reveal formal designs deeply reminiscent of the traditions of tonal instrumental music. This essay examines the String Trio, particularly its first movement, using the trope of \u201cinvented tradition\u201d articulated by historian Eric Hobsbawm, in order to show that those formal traditions are not simply followed, but are transformed through radically new twelve-tone relations. The symbolic function of tradition, not mere convention, provides an orderly outline within which Webern developed new discursive practices that became part of his unique twelve-tone language. Invented tradition in the context of the String Trio not only offers insights into Webern\u2019s new discursive practices, but also into the multifaceted nature of musical modernism.\n\nThis article is part of a special, serialized feature: A Music-Theoretical Matrix: Essays in Honor of Allen Forte (Part V).",

While methodological experimentation is widely welcomed across the social sciences, there is little talk of innovation in ethical principles and practice. We argue that research ethics is an \u2018invented tradition\u2019 (Hobsbawm 2012), which has become unquestioned convention. We take up the archiving and reuse of qualitative research data as a challenging, yet compelling, site of methodological innovation, where ethical considerations often appear as an insurmountable barrier. Ethical concerns about informed consent and anonymity, given unknown future use of data, and commitments to destroying data to protect research participants, appear undone by calls to share data. We take up the work of community archives, feminist and queer archivists and archival theory, as generative sites for developing an archival imaginary for researchers. We recount how we came to unsettle ethical practice through creating a \u2018DIY academic archive\u2019, a digital open access research archive, Clayoquot Lives: An Ecofeminist Story Web (https://clayoquotlives.sps.ed.ac.uk/). Against a paternalistic research culture of risk avoidance, we argue that care always involves risk. An inventive feminist ethic of care-full risk can resource new ethical research, reimagining research by embracing the risk of caring for data.",

The author analyzes various viewpoints on the common pan-Romance state, including the arguments of supporters and opponents of its existence. \nNovelty. The novelty of the study lies in the analysis of interpretations of the common pan-Romance state in contexts of the history of the Romance languages through the prism of intellectual history and the history of ideas. \nMaterials and methods. Methodologically, the article is based on the principles of interdisciplinary historiography proposed in intellectual and cultural history, which allows us to analyze the problems of the common pan-Romance state as part of the history of ideas and an invented historiographic tradition or intellectual construct. \nResults. The article analyzes 1) the arguments of supporters of the existence of a common Romance state as a stage between Latin and Romance languages, 2) the ideas of critics and opponents of the idea of a common Romance state, who tend to look for the origins of the Romance languages directly in Latin, 3) the possibilities and potency of revising early viewpoints in contexts the history of late Latin and the early genesis of the Romance languages. The article also analyzes 1) the arguments of supporters and opponents of the existence of the common Romance state through the prism of intellectual history and the history of ideas, 2) the history of Romance philology through the prism of the archaeology of ideas, which allows us to trace how the arguments of supporters and opponents of the common Romance state have changed, 3) the general logic of the development of Romance philology through the prism of the transformation of ideas about the general Romance state. \nConclusions. The results of the study suggest that 1) ideas about the common Romance state in the history of Romance linguistic became a common historiographic place, turning into an invented intellectual and historiographical tradition, 2) discussions and debates about the existence or absence of a general Romance state stimulated the search for new ideas, contributing to the development of Romance philology, 3) the controversy and debatability of the concept of the general Romance state in the history of Romance philology will remain a factor contributing to intellectual discussions and actualization of the role of revisionism as a universal factor in the development of modern interdisciplinary linguistics.",

      "abstract": "The article considers the problem of unity and variety of the contemporary theories of tradition that appear in different fields of scholarship. It is argued that the unity of these theories is mainly a discursive one. This theoretical dis\u00adcourse, which starts with the famous essays of T.S. Eliot, M. Oakeshott, and K. Popper, ascribes to the tradition rationality, flexibility, the active participa\u00adtion of the individual in the functioning of tradition and non-authoritative cha\u00adracter. The concept of \u2018invented tradition\u2019, which describes tradition as rigid and unchangeable, presupposes its deliberative and rational character. The theo\u00adries are more or less unanimously challenge the opposition between tradition and rationality. At the same time the term \u2018tradition\u2019 possesses various mea\u00adnings and functions not only in different theories, but also within a single theory. The unity of the problems and \u2018puzzles\u2019 that the concept of tradition should solve is weak and is getting weaker. The article puts forward a hypothe\u00adsis that the discourse about tradition reflects the situation, in which the episte\u00admological paradigm of Cartesian subject is felt to be insecure. The metho\u00addological reflection grows, but still cannot change the model, because it mere ascribes to the tradition the qualities of its opposite, and mere leads to the blur\u00adring of the concept of tradition.",

The author calls for recognition of the productive forces of the Enlightenment, which appear as defenders of rational transparency and intellectual honesty. By rejecting the teleological context and focusing on formal aspects, Enlightenment ideas lead to a loss of connection with concrete reality and the purpose of actions. The last decades have seen a revival of the classical tradition, but there are difficulties in understanding the physical order and its relationship with the moral order. The author agrees with the criticism of the Enlightenment project, but opposes the rejection of any universalist project in general. Considering value pluralism as a result of the late Enlightenment, the author points out that the universalist project is opposed by various forms of relativism. It is in this context that tradition should resume its role.",

Of particular interest in Panciroli's work is his approach to the search and comparison of phenomena that fell out of use due to the fall of the Roman Empire or came into use in the updated tradition already in the Middle Ages. The formulation of the problem and the logic of the reasoning of the author of the treatise fully reveal his ideas about the replenishment and loss of knowledge available to people in a historical perspective. The main merit of Panchiroli is an attempt to reconstruct the circle of forgotten and new technologies by comparing different historical periods. At the same time, the author strives for the impartiality of his judgments and does not try to reveal the superiority of one era over another. Through an appeal to the \"forgotten\" and \"lost\" ancient knowledge, Panchiroli gives it publicity, draws attention to it, which together leaves hope for the possibility of revival. The \"new\" inventions, which somehow became part of the European tradition, personified the increment of knowledge. Their discovery became another confirmation that reality is plastic and subject not only to oblivion, but to renewal.\n",

By deconstructing Plato\u2019s theorization of signification, I question the historical process by which the \u201csovereignty of the signifier\u201d (in Michel Foucault\u2019s terms) came to be established, and I reposition Plato as a theorist in the rhetorical tradition who, by redefining the key terms of onoma, rh\u00eama, and logos, created a theory of language that made lies all the more potent by reducing them to \u201cmere signification.\u201d It is this understanding of language as merely signifying and referencing the world that, I argue, lies at the root of the post-truth problem in 21st-century politics. While Plato\u2019s truth problem is characterized by \u201csilence without disproof,\u201d our own post-truth problem is characterized as \u201cdisproof without silence.\u201d",

The epiphanic moment of confronting the other shifted the focus from Europe to the East, where scholars realized that the epistemic discourse of their own countries reflected the same a priori delimitation of knowledge. The Radhakrishnan Commission, for example, proposed in 1948 that the fields of natural science, social science, and the humanities should study different aspects of reality: facts, events, and values, respectively. In order to dismantle the epistemic dominance of western knowledge and eradicate the homogeneity of discourses, the time has come to highlight, as Bakhtin would have it, the importance of comparative dialogic in establishing cross-cultural dialogic. In a same vein, the Orientalist paradigm has to shift toward a focus on humanistic conversation between South and South and a reconfiguration of the Asian dilemma of singularities. To get a holistic comprehension of human beings, a paradigm shift and rethinking\u2014what Derrida terms Transformed Humanities, New Humanities\u2014is essential.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Yakut shamanism is an important aspect of traditional culture that specifically articulates certain customary beliefs. The paper analyzes various approaches to understanding shamanism, including evolutionist theory, a constructivist approach, and the concept of \u2018invented tradition\u2019. It is noted that Yakut shamanism has pronounced dualistic features reflecting the division of mythological thinking into good and evil, as well as the juxtaposition of divine and evil beings. Goals. The study seeks to examine some manifestations of dualism in Yakut shamanic practices. Materials and methods. The research rests on the theoretical approach adopted by G. Ksenofontov who analyzed the issue as follows: he would associate it with the transition from the cult of bull to that of horse paralleled by certain class processes. G. Ksenofontova tended to divide religion into \u2018upper\u2019 (white shamans) and \u2018lower\u2019 (black ones) levels, and would focus on that in folk culture the former disappeared while the latter survived \u2014 the conversion to Christianity. The analysis also involves field data collected during ethnographic expeditions to Yakutia\u2019s rural districts in 2022\u20132024. Results. The work considers two key scientific paradigms that define the study of shamanism\u00a0\u2014 essentialism and constructivism. Particular attention is given to the dualistic concept manifested in the division of shamanism into \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 practices (and shamans). The paper outlines these two types, their functions, rituals, and roles in Yakut culture. There is also an insight into how Christianity has influenced traditional shamanism, which notes the advent of Christian priests resulted in that roles of shamans as cult ministers did change, and the latter led to some aspects of \u2018white\u2019 shamanism associated with the worship of ancestors and deities would be lost. Our appeals to Ysyakh holiday practices show how this dualistic structure manifests itself in ritual culture that comprises symbols of both fertility and destruction. The paper also stresses some healing methods used by shamans (and their characteristics) that further accentuate dualism in religious beliefs and shamanic practices of the Sakha. Conclusions. So, the article identifies manifestations of dualism in functional and sacred parts of Yakut shamanism, delineates traditional methods and tools of shamanic healing practices. It is urgent to employ an integrated approach to the study of Yakut shamanism, since both traditional and modern elements \u2014 e. g., such a trend as neo-Shamanism \u2014 should be as taken into consideration for deeper understanding of its significance in the context of Sakha cultural heritage.\n",

      "abstract": "The early Greek philosophers invented the tradition of adopting critical attitude towards explanations that were robed in mythic garbs. They not only challenged the explanations of the ancients, they also criticized and falsified long standing traditions with empirical observations and tests. This attitude to knowledge is what Karl Popper described as critical rationalism. Critical rationalists believe that scientific theory or any other claim to knowledge can and should be rationally criticized and if they have empirical content can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them. Claims to knowledge that are potentially falsifiable can be admitted to the body of empirical science while not foreclosing further falsification. But this kind of rationalism was faulted by some philosophers including Paul Feyerabend who argued that it may not be easy for science to grow by the rules of critical rationalism but that scientific knowledge will be better off with the method of \u2018anything goes\u2019. The objective of this paper was to critically evaluate some of the criticisms against critical rationalism to ascertain their validity or otherwise. The analytic method was used. The paper is of the view that the rejection of critical rationalism and the recommendation of anarchism for the growth of science is misplaced because lawlessness breeds neither growth nor knowledge.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the reader to the Periodic Table of the World's Religious and Philosophical Traditions (PTWRPT). It summarizes its background history, the conceptual thinking that underlies it, and explains why and how it was created. Using the same thinking that underlies Mendeleyev's Periodic Table of the Elements, it sets out in clear form all the world's different categories of religious and philosophical beliefs, showing the relationships and connections that exist between them. Each box of the table, as in Mendeleyev's table, gives the reader at a glance information about the faith tradition in question: when it was invented, how many people subscribe to that faith at the present, how many people in the whole of history up to now have followed this tradition, and which of the overall 16 categories of world faiths it belongs to. The table provides a basic bedrock of solid factual information for students to go on and explore the inner details of these complex traditions. Most importantly, it gives students the realization that the world's faiths, and our religious and philosophical traditions are far more complex and interesting than hitherto simplistic presentations have made out and that the subject deserves to be treated with as much seriousness as, say, chemistry, physics, or mathematics. The paper poses important philosophical questions about the metaphysical unity of ideas possibly underlying all these traditions and how the table can be of great value to frontline teachers and academics trying to get across the complexity of religious studies and philosophy to young minds.",

      "abstract": "Christianity has traditionally distanced itself from speaking about reincarnation. Yet claims are sometimes made, especially in esoteric circles, that such ideas were present in various heretical groups in its history, such as the Gnostics in the early Church and the Cathars in the medieval period. This article argues that Platonic and Christian ideas about the journey of the soul have always been in evolution. Metempsychosis as expounded in Pythagorean and Platonic tradition as involving the transfer of an individual\u2019s soul into another living being, is subtly different from reincarnation, a term that was invented only in the mid-nineteenth century. It adapts the Christian notion of \u2018incarnation\u2019 as formulated in John\u2019s Gospel. This article argues that while ancient or medieval groups never spoke about reincarnation as such, Christians developed other ways of thinking about how the soul might be purged after death, namely through purgatory. Reincarnation as such was formulated in the nineteenth century to reflect ideas of spiritual progress, rather different from those conventionally associated with metempsychosis.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Among historians of philosophy, a long-standing tradition holds that Augustine invented the modern concept of \u2018the will\u2019. Against this tradition, recent scholarship has tended to conclude that the Augustinian term voluntas refers not to a faculty of the soul, but only a volition. I argue that the correct understanding of Augustine\u2019s use of voluntas is a middle ground: Augustine uses the term equivocally, sometimes referring to an individual volition, sometimes referring to something more, namely, a source of willing in the soul. Proponents of the volition-only reading make a strong case for their view by showing that texts from the Augustinian corpus only make sense when voluntas is read as a volition; however, the same method of textual analysis can be used to defend the tradition of reading voluntas as a faculty. Ultimately, Augustine\u2019s discussion of the nature of voluntas in De trinitate, his historical context, and his theological commitments suggest that neither reading alone sufficiently captures Augustine\u2019s use of the term. At play in Augustine\u2019s thought is a novel sense of the term voluntas which is neither inherited from ancient philosophy nor a familiar contemporary concept, but something transitional between the two: a proto-faculty of will.",

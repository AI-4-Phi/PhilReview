Drawing from a variety of disciplinary traditions, including political science, sociology, and anthropology, the book provides in-depth case studies of specific conflicts as well as comparative studies of multiple conflicts. Among other themes, the book examines why and how some rebels establish both structures and practices of rule, the role of ideology, cultural, and material factors affecting rebel governance strategies, the impact of governance on the rebel/civilian relationship, civilian responses to rebel rule, the comparison between modes of state and non-state governance to rebel attempts to establish political order, the political economy of rebel governance, and the decline and demise of rebel governance attempts.",

      "abstract": "The <italic>History of Russian Literature</italic> provides a comprehensive account of Russian writing from its earliest origins in the monastic works of Kiev up to the present day, still rife with the creative experiments of post-Soviet literary life. Five chronological parts by design unfold in diachronic histories; they can be read individually but are presented as inseparable across the span of a national literature. Throughout its course, this <italic>History</italic> follows literary processes as they worked in respective periods and places, whether in monasteries, at court, in publishing houses, in the literary marketplace, or the Writers\u2019 Union. Evolving institutional practices used to organize literature are themselves a part of the story of literature told in poetry, drama, and prose including diaries and essays. Equally prominent is the idea of writers\u2019 agency in responding to tradition and reacting to larger forces such as church and state that shape the literary field. Coverage strikes a balance between extensive overview and in-depth thematic discussion, addressing trans-historical questions through case studies detailing the importance of texts, figures, and notions. The book does not follow the decline model often used in accounts of the nineteenth century as a change-over between ages of prose and poetry. We trace in the evolution of literature two interrelated processes: changes in subjectivities and the construction of national narratives. It is through categories of nationhood, literary politics, and literary life, forms of selfhood, and forms of expression that the intense influence of literature on a culture as a whole occurs.",

      "abstract": "She referred to the high-rise as if it were some kind of huge animate presence, brooding over them and keeping a magisterial eye on the events taking place. There was something in this feeling \u2014 the elevators pumping up and down the long shafts resembled pistons in the chamber of a heart. The residents moving along the corridors were the cells in a network of arteries, the lights in their apartments the neurones of a brain (J.G. Ballard, 1975: 40). Now, the boundaries between the organic and the inorganic, blurred by cybernetic and bio-technologies, seem less sharp; the body, itself invaded and re-shaped by technology, invades and permeates the space outside, even as this space takes on dimensions that themselves confuse the inner and the outer, visually, mentally and physically (Anthony Vidler, 1990: 37\u20138). The body-territory [corpo-territorio] poses a problematic form of corporeal identity that in becoming ever more routinized has tended to dissolve the distinctions that formerly existed between the organic and the inorganic (Tiziana Villani, 1995: 118). As she tentatively begins to play the piano, the replicant, named Rachel, recalls that she once had lessons but cannot be sure whether these memories are her own or simply the implanted memories of someone else. In this poignant scene in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) we explore the possibility that human identities might be artificially created in order to produce advanced androids whose intelligence and sensitivity is comparable with that of their human creators. The figure of the cyborg, as represented in science fiction cinema, is not an automaton or robot but a sophisticated creation that seems to simultaneously extend but also threaten our understanding of what it means to be human. If we were to locate the cyborg as an idea, we could say that it is clearly linked to fantastical combinations of bodies and machines but is nonetheless a way of thinking about the world. It is, in other words, an ontological strategy for extending the limits to human knowledge as well as an apposite means of describing those phenomena that appear to reside outside conventional frameworks of understanding. If a cyborgian sensibility is explored within the context of the contemporary city, we find that it has developed out of several interconnecting strands of thought as a trope of critical reflection which uncovers a series of anomalies, fractures and tensions lurking within dominant modes of urban and architectural thinking. Since the early 1960s the potential applications of the cyborg concept have proliferated to include developments such as whole organism cloning, in vitro fertilization, gene sequencing, advanced prosthetics and other sophisticated medical technologies. In tandem with these technological manifestations, the imaginative field of the cyborg has expanded through literature, cinema and the fantasy spaces of contemporary culture.1 It is since the mid-1980s, however, that the idea of the cyborg has been associated with a more densely argued series of theoretical applications as a means to explore the interface between technology and the body. The key intervention here is Donna Haraway's article entitled 'A Cyborg Manifesto', first published in the Socialist Review in 1985, and later included in her influential collection of essays Simians, Cyborgs and Women where she writes in her introduction (1991a: 1): A cyborg is a hybrid creature, composed of organism and machine. But, cyborgs are compounded of special kinds of machines and special kinds of organisms appropriate to the late twentieth century. Cyborgs are post-Second World War hybrid entities made of, first, ourselves and other organic creatures in our unchosen \"high-technological\" guise as information systems, texts, and ergonomically controlled labouring, desiring, and reproducing systems. The second essential ingredient in cyborgs is machines in their guise, also, as communications systems, texts, and self-acting, ergonomically designed apparatuses. This succinct and revealing definition reminds us that the idea of the cyborg, as originally elaborated by Haraway, is at root a political as well as an intellectual project, an idea which originated in and from the 'belly of the monster' (1991a: 4), that nexus of political and economic entanglements that we might term the 'first world' in distinction to the proliferating spaces of marginality that lie beyond.2 Since its inception as a critical intellectual concept in the 1980s the cyborg metaphor has been deployed to challenge disembodied, dualistic, masculinist and teleological bodies of knowledge. It has infused science and technology studies with feminist epistemological strategies. It has opened up new possibilities for the understanding of relations between nature and culture. And it has facilitated greater sensitivity towards social and spatial complexity through its emphasis on 'situated knowledges'. The idea of the cyborg shares an affinity with related concepts such as 'cyberspace', 'cybernetics' and 'cyberpunk'. Yet the contemporary use of the term 'cyborg' is different from these virtual, analytical and fictional constructs because it is grounded in the living and breathing flesh of the human body. Whilst the 'cyber-' metaphor has tended to be associated with various forms of virtuality, the idea of the cyborg is closely linked with the corporeal experience of space.3 In this sense the cyborg can be read as an alternative way of conceptualizing the growth and development of cities that serves to destabilize the pervasive narratives of dematerialization, spatial malleability and virtualization. The underlying materiality of the cyborg metaphor has acquired heightened significance now that the earlier polarity between virtual space and 'meat space' articulated in the first wave of cyber literature is losing its conceptual utility and now that the very idea of 'virtual reality' is itself imploding as it becomes either relocated in the context of a heightened dimension of the real (see, for example, \u017di\u017eek, 2002) or simply derided as an inherently oxymoronic formulation (see Grosz, 2001).4 The emphasis of the cyborg on the material interface between the body and the city is perhaps most strikingly manifested in the physical infrastructure that links the human body to vast technological networks. If we understand the cyborg to be a cybernetic creation, a hybrid of machine and organism, then urban infrastructures can be conceptualized as a series of interconnecting life-support systems (see Swyngedouw, 1996; Marras, 1999; Gandy, 2002; Mitchell, 2003). The modern home, for example, has become a complex exoskeleton for the human body with its provision of water, warmth, light and other essential needs. The home can be conceived as 'prosthesis and prophylactic' in which modernist distinctions between nature and culture, and between the organic and the inorganic, become blurred (Vidler, 1990: 37). And beyond the boundaries of the home itself we find a vast interlinked system of networks, pipes and wires that enable the modern city to function. These interstitial spaces of connectivity within individual buildings extend through urban space to produce a multi-layered structure of extraordinary complexity and utility. The figure of the cyborg is at root a spatial metaphor. But how does the idea of the cyborg intersect with spatial theory? In what ways does the cyborg reinforce or contradict other emerging strands of urban thought that also emphasize urban complexity and hybridity? Has the epistemological subtlety and political prescience of the cyborg, as originally formulated in the 1980s, been realized in practice or simply been diffused through the term's widening usage? And should we ultimately reject the idea of the cyborg as an anachronism derived from cold war science and the first generation of twentieth-century cyberpunk culture? In the rest of this article I will try to address these issues through an exploration of the somewhat haphazard presence of the cyborg in contemporary urban discourse. I will focus in particular on the example of urban infrastructure as a concrete manifestation of the cyborg idea in order to explore different facets of the relationship between the city, the body and the human subject. My aim is not to foreclose discussions surrounding the 'cyborg city' but to open up a series of dialogues in order to explore contemporary thinking around these questions. One of the principal difficulties with delineating the cyborg city as a clearly defined entity is derived from the entanglement of the cyborg idea with a variety of urban metaphors ranging from organicist conceptions of the nineteenth-century city to 'neo-organicist' representations of the post-industrial metropolis. In its classic nineteenth-century form the organicist conception of the city emerged out of a functional analogy, originating within the medical sciences, wherein spatial differentiation corresponded with a distinctive arrangement of human organs. We find that Kantian notions of the self-organizational characteristics of animate matter were combined with new insights into the human vascular and arterial system and an emerging circulatory emphasis within the nascent science of political economy. In recent years, however, the organicist emphasis on the city as an integrated body with identifiable organs, which emerged in response to the nineteenth-century industrial city, has been increasingly displaced by the idea of urban space as a prosthetic extension to the human body. The body-city problematic has been reconceptualized in the context of post-Cartesian and post-positivist modes of thinking. The emphasis on the city as a self-contained body or machine has been challenged by a hybridized conception of space as a system of technological devices that enhances human productive and imaginative capabilities. The cyborg metaphor not only reworks the metabolic preoccupations of the nineteenth-century industrial city but also extends to a contemporary body of ideas that we can term 'neo-organicist' on account of the deployment of biophysical metaphors for the interpretation of social and spatial complexity. In the neo-organicist city we encounter a shift of emphasis away from an anatomical conception of space as an assemblage of individual organs towards a neurological reading of space as a diffuse and interconnected realm of human interaction. The film maker Michael Burke, for example, director of Cyborg City (1999), describes how beneath the 'glass and concrete' of the future city there will be a 'humming mass of technology' acting as a central nervous system, 'constantly monitoring and controlling both its own functions and those of its citizens' (Burke, 1998).5 The mechanical and hierarchical model of the relationship between the body and the city has been supplanted by a more complex and non-linear pattern of urban development in response to the spread of new information technologies (see Gille, 1986; Rabinbach, 1990; Akira, 2001). The organicist city of the modern era was founded on a clear separation between mind and body that enabled the city to be conceptualized as a coherent entity to be acted upon, disciplined, regulated and shaped according to human will. The emergence of the neo-organicist city, in contrast, is founded on the blurring of boundaries rather than their repeated delineation. At the same time, however, there remain important continuities between the kind of machine-based metaphors associated with the early twentieth-century futurism of figures such as Mario Chiattone, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Antoniono Sant'Elia and the elaborate computer-based metaphors deployed in the contemporary city (see Villani, 1995; Boyer, 1996; Schaub, 1998). Other significant continuities include, for example, the avant-garde bricolage of early cinema and the surrealist bodies depicted in the art of Hans Bellmer, Francis Picabia and other responses to 'a sterile and over rationalised technological realism' (Vidler, 1990: 42).6 These interconnecting strands between cultural modernism and the emergence of the cyborg metaphor are significant because they underlie the centrality of corporeal metaphors for the critical interpretation of urban form. The current emphasis on corporeal and neurological analogies in the neo-organicist literature owes more to earlier developments than is widely acknowledged. We can detect two principal dimensions to contemporary neo-organicist urban thought. A first strand, rooted in the bio-physical sciences, perceives the city to be a special kind of complex, yet intricately ordered system. This homeostatic perspective, which is inflected by ecological thinking and recent developments in evolutionary biology, has diffused through parts of the architectural literature and is only tangentially linked with the epistemological challenge of cyborg theory.7 A second and more intellectually significant development is represented by the convergence of ideas surrounding the 'thinking space' of the city and the indeterminacy of spatial forms. If the body-city nexus is conceptualized as a thinking machine then the analytical focus shifts towards the identification of those critical networks or 'neurones' that sustain the relationship between the body and the city (Kurokawa, 2001a). Though this dimension to the neo-organicist perspective shares important continuities with the technological preoccupations of early twentieth-century modernism, it extends its conceptual purview into different aspects of cultural modernism. The influential speculations of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, for example, develop Antonin Artaud's conception of the 'body without organs' to produce a philosophy of spatial complexity quite different from that associated with dominant modernist traditions (Deleuze and Guattari, 1986; 1987; Rajchman, 2000; Uno, 2001). Their philosophical challenge is to perceive space in the absence of any previously existent categories, hierarchies or systems as a form of 'anarchic non-identical proliferation' (Luckhurst, 1997: 128). The organic metaphor of the 'rhizome' is deployed in distinction to 'arborescent' conceptions of cities as hierarchical structures (Teysott, 1990; Akira, 2001; Kurokawa, 2001a). In addition to this emphasis on non-hierarchical structures of difference Deleuze and Guattari's conception of concrete space also seeks to incorporate the imaginary, libidinous and oneiric realms of human experience. From their 'neo-vitalist' perspective, which builds on the philosophical ideas of Henri Bergson, the virtual realm is not simply a mimesis or reflection of physical reality but an independent domain that generates new kinds of spaces and ideas. The political significance of the virtual realm lies in its experimental and emergent role as part of an envisioned space that has yet to be realized within the taken-for-granted realm of concrete reality (Boundas, 1996; Massumi, 2001). The role of the diagram or 'abstract machine' takes on special significance in this context as an attempt to give visual expression to new models of reality.8 In the case of architecture, for example, there has been an intense dialogue between developments in building design and the speculative possibilities engendered by computer-aided simulations so that 'physical space increasingly resembles cyberspace' (Mitchell, 2003: 197). Some architectural practices have deployed so-called 'genetic algorithms' in order to generate a form of 'in vitro' architecture which derives its inspiration from nature yet remains autonomous from it as a purely digitized space of imaginative exploration (see Chu, 2002; De Landa, 2002).9 Examples of architectural practice inflected by post-structuralist ideas which move beyond purely 'in vitro' speculations to fully realized projects include the work of Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry and Bernard Tschumi, where sophisticated combinations of form, structure and materials have been achieved, which are quite at odds with modernist conceptions of architectural form. A conceptual synthesis can be discerned in some of the recent literature between post-structuralist philosophies of space and Latourian conceptions of actor-network theory to produce a new kind of urban theorization which eschews the meta-narratives associated with neo-Marxian approaches. Building on the insights of Deleuze and Guattari these approaches have sought to remove all the extrinsic or foundational aspects to urban theory and pare analysis down to the movements and interactions that constitute 'the city' as a particular kind of spatial form or activity that is independent of conventional accounts of scale, structure or order.10 The brain or 'thinking space' of the city persists yet is dispersed through innumerable nodes and networks in contrast with the embodied cyborg citizen to be found in the more technophile literature. We can trace these developments back to the emerging critique of architectural modernism in the 1970s and 1980s that increasingly drew on the theoretical ontologies of post-structuralism in order to advance a radically unplanned built form.11 From this perspective the role of 'chaos', for example, takes on a very different significance from that associated with the modernist city and is perceived as a field of evolutionary and radical experimentation. Chaos is no longer seen as an anomalous dimension to the urban experience to be problematized or excluded from analysis but a rich vein of social and spatial interaction through which we may perceive signs of alternative or hitherto overlooked urban forms. Chaos may also be characterized as a more sophisticated, resilient and adaptable form of order as Rem Koolhaas has suggested with respect to the dynamics of West African urbanism (Koolhaas et al., 2001; Koolhaas, 2002). The theoretical novelty of such a perspective sits sharply at odds, however, with the capacity for what one might term 'avant-garde urbanism' to actually explicate any substantial dimensions to urban change (see, for example, Rauterberg, 2002; Gandy, 2004b). We can detect within urban and architectural discourse an emerging counter current to post-structuralist and avant-garde urbanism led by a of and political (see 1996; and 1998).

      "abstract": "Abstract Neorealist theory holds that the international system compels states to adopt similar adaptive strategies\u2014namely, balancing and emulation\u2014or risk elimination as independent entities. Yet states do not always emulate the successful practices of the system's leading states in a timely and uniform fashion. Explaining this requires a theory that integrates systemic-level and unit-level variables: a \"resource-extraction\" model of the state in neoclassical realism. External vulnerability provides incentives for states to emulate the practices of the system's leading states or to counter such practices through innovation. Neoclassical realism, however, suggests that state power\u2014the relative ability of the state to extract and mobilize resources from domestic society\u2014shapes the types of internal balancing strategies that countries are likely to pursue. State power, in turn, is a function of the institutions of the state, as well as of nationalism and ideology. The experiences of six rising or declining great powers over the past three hundred years\u2014China, France, Great Britain, Japan, Prussia (later Germany), and the United States\u2014illustrate the plausibility of these hypotheses.

Throughout this paper, I use the terms \"balance-of-power theory\" and \"neorealism\" interchangeably to denote the theory Waltz developed in Theory of International Politics.

See Herrera and Mahnken, \"Military Diffusion in Nineteenth-Century Europe,\" 210\u2013212. The selective adoption of Soviet military doctrine, weapons, and organization by Egypt, Syria, and Iraq after the 1967 Middle East war, however, do constitute emulation. See Michael J.

Hobson uses the term \"domestic agential power,\" which he defines as \"the power of the state to determine (foreign) policy and shape the domestic realm free of domestic structural constraints or non-state actor interference.\" I prefer the term \"state power\" because it is more consistent with current usage in the neoclassical realist literature. 26For a definition of major war, see Dale Copeland, Origins of Major War (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000), 3\u20134. By Copeland's criteria, there have been six major wars in the modern state system: the Thirty Years' War (1618\u201348), the wars of Louis XIV (1688\u20131714), the Seven Years' War (1756\u201363), the Napoleonic Wars (1803\u201315), the First World War (1914\u201318), and the Second World War (1939\u201345). 27Hobson, State and International Relations, 51. 28See Morgenthau, Politics among Nations, 205\u20136 and 218\u201319; and Kissinger, A World Restored, 156\u201357.

See Taliaferro, \"Security Seeking under Anarchy,\" esp. 136\u201341; Robert Jervis, \"Realism, Neoliberalism, and Cooperation: Understanding the Debate,\" International Security 24, no. 1 (summer 1999): 42\u201363, esp. 47\u201350; and Robert Jervis, \"Cooperation under the Security Dilemma,\" World Politics 30, no. 2 (January 1978): 168\u2013214. 53Sterling-Folker, \"Realist Environment,\" 4\u20138. 54See, for example, Jeffrey W.

Vasquez, \"The New Debate on the Balance-of-Power: A Reply to My Critics,\" in Vasquez and Elman, Realism and the Balancing of Power, 87\u2013113. 55The one exception is Randall Schweller's balance-of-interest theory, which purports to explain both the foreign policies of individual great powers and the likelihood of major war across different types of international systems (multipolar, tripolar, and bipolar). See Randall Schweller, Deadly Imbalances: Tripolarity and Hitler's Strategy for World Conquest (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998). 56Schweller, unlike other neoclassical realists, maintains that a neat division between theories of foreign policy and theories of international politics is unsustainable on logical and methodological grounds. See Schweller, \"Progressiveness of Neoclassical Realism\" 321\u201322. I disagree with him on this point. 57See Waltz, Theory of International Politics, 18\u201319 and 37; and, earlier, Kenneth N.

      "abstract": "Abstract Increasingly, North Americans and Western Europeans identify as \u201cspiritual but not religious.\u201d But what does \u201cspirituality\u201d actually mean? And what does this recent \u201cspiritual turn\u201d reveal about the nature of twenty-first-century liberal democracies? Secularization theorists argue that \u201cspirituality\u201d lacks institutional support and a shared tradition, thereby evincing religious decline. Meanwhile, critical commentators contend that the spiritual turn embodies all of the ills of post-1960s liberal democracies. This book challenges these popular misconceptions. Combining cultural sociology with intellectual history and political philosophy, and drawing from first-hand interview and fieldwork data, along with discourse analysis of best-selling books, it shows that rather than reflecting religious decline, the spiritual turn marks the rise of an enduring cultural structure in Western modernity\u2014the religion of the heart. Tracing the rise of the religion of the heart to the 1960s, the book illuminates its elective affinities with the romantic liberal social imaginary that crystallized in popular consciousness during this era, and transformed the institutional spheres of Western liberal democracies, eventually giving birth to a new social order\u2014romantic liberal modernity. Then, inspired by the Durkheimian tradition, it presents case studies of three sites where the religion of the heart is institutionalized in a specific discursive form\u2014a Twelve Step group, a neo-Pentecostal church, and a Toastmasters public speaking club. The book concludes that while critics may have reason to disparage both \u201cspirituality\u201d and romantic liberal modernity more generally, the reality is far more complex than their criticisms suggest\u2014and more importantly, far less hopeless.",

      "abstract": "This edited volume uses the prism of bad rule or tyranny to sharpen our understanding of political discourse from the ancient world to the Renaissance. Eleven chapters present case studies examining Hebrew, Greco-Roman, Byzantine, early, high, and late medieval, and Renaissance conceptions and representations of bad or tyrannical government. Since bad rule is always a perversion of the norm, its shifting conceptualizations shed light on historically specific assessments of what constitutes legitimate and acceptable political behavior. Meanwhile, political debate also reflects specific power structures, authors, and audiences. The book\u2019s chapters, therefore, examine notions of bad rule within the ideological frameworks and societal patterns of the respective periods, thus painting a picture of historical and intellectual change. However, these often profound variations notwithstanding, the book also shows that it is meaningful to think of its subject as a \u2018premodern Western tradition\u2019, in the sense of an exchange of ideas. There are shared roots in Greek and biblical thought, and ongoing cross-fertilization spanning two millennia. Moreover, the rationale of both pro- and anti-monarchical discourse by and large derives from virtue ethics, in their Greek, Roman, and Christian incarnations. This reliance on morality as the foundation of political organization only declined in the sixteenth century, which therefore marks the end of the story of tyranny in premodern political thought told in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is no lack of studies that point at discomforting trends in community life and citizens' social and political involvement in contemporary society. According to various indicators, Americans have become increasingly disconnected from their families, friends, neighbours and associations, leading to a decline of civic community and social trust and to more individual unhappiness. Similar developments are supposed to take place elsewhere. In this article we use data from the European and World Values Studies to address, for North America and Western Europe, (1) trends regarding voluntary associations, social trust, political involvement and happiness in the 1981\u20132000 period; (2) changing patterns and types of involvement in associations; and (3) macro and micro relationships between this involvement and political involvement, social trust and happiness. We find no general decline in these traits, no trend towards more passive membership, and only mixed evidence for positive connections between involvement, trust and happiness. Keywords: Civil Societyvoluntary associationsvolunteeringsocial trustpolitical involvementhappiness Notes 1. This article is a revision of a paper presented and discussed at the Sixth International Conference of the International Society for Third-sector Research, Ryerson University, Toronto, 11\u201314 July 2004. 2. See Wuthnow Citation(1998) and Skocpol Citation(2003) for other aspects of these changes, such as the growing dominance of professionals in organizing voluntary involvement and the organizational shift \u201cfrom membership to management in American civic life\u201d (the subtitle of Skocpol's book). 3. See http://www.europeanvalues.nl/, http://wvs.isr.umich.edu/, Halman (2001) and Inglehart et al. Citation(2004). We want to thank the principal investigators for their work on these surveys and for making the data available to other researchers. 4. See Curtis et al. Citation(1992) for an analysis of the 1981 data, Curtis et al. Citation(2001) as well as Schofer and Fiourcade-Gourinchas Citation(2001) for the 1990 data, and Inglehart and Hodgkinson Citation(2003) for the 2000 data. These authors all focus on patterns of membership or volunteering and on explanations of differences between countries. 5. Although it participated in all waves, the UK is missing from our analyses, as the UK-data lack an identical measurement of trust in 2000 (and because of highly unlikely results for belonging to sports associations in GB in 2000; cf. Dekker et al., Citation2003, p. 223); Norway participated in EVS 1981 and 1990, but not in 2000, it was part of WVS 1996, but with a different question on voluntary associations. 6. In some cases variables only admit dichotomies, in other cases distributions are so skewed that dichotomies are the best representation. For the remaining indicators we prefer dichotomies to ordinal measurements for reasons of simplicity, in particular for a surveyable presentation of interaction effects. 7. See the Appendix table. For an overview of different wordings and their consequences and other problems of the longitudinal and cross national measurement of associational membership in population surveys, see Morales (Citation2002, including further references). 8. See Dekker et al. Citation(2003) for relationships between these alternative indicators and involvement in voluntary associations. 9. Data from the European Social Survey 2002/2003 and other surveys reveal similar grouping of European countries (cf. Morales, Citation2004). 10. Belonging to an organization for \u2018nature and environment\u2019 can mean a regular gift for WNF or Greenpeace, a membership card that allows for a walk in a nature reserve, activity in a local advocacy group, and much more. There are different national traditions of organizing leisure and collective action. A comparison, for instance, of people involved in collective action for the environment in a Northern and a Southern European country could in fact be a comparison of mainly donators with mainly demonstrators (cf. SCP, Citation2001, pp. 151\u2013166).",

      "abstract": "AbstractThrough what political, economic, cultural and social processes is difference transformed into inequality? Specifically, how are linguistic and religious pluralism implicated in the production and reproduction of inequality? I consider the political rules that privilege some languages and religions and disprivilege others; the processes that confer differential economic value on particular languages and religions; the discursive and symbolic processes that confer prestige, honour and stigma on particular languages and religions; and the differential informal treatment of persons who speak different languages or practice different religions, as well as the ways in which linguistically or religiously differentiated social networks entail differential access to the resources that flow through such networks. I argue that political and economic forces generate deeper and more consequential forms of inequality between languages than between religions in contemporary liberal societies, while discursive and symbolic processes generate more profound forms of inequality between religions. The major sources of religious inequality derive from religion's thicker cultural, normative and political content, while the major sources of linguistic inequality come from the pervasiveness of language, and from the increasingly and inescapably 'languaged' nature of political, economic and cultural life in the modern world.Keywords: LanguageReligionDifferenceInequalityPluralism This paper was presented as the keynote address to the conference on 'States, Rights and People: Trying to Manage Diversity,' April 10, 2014, organised by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research and the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies.

Pluralism in this sense is a condition, not a normative or political stance.[3] On Hinduism, see Van der Veer (Citation1994); on objectification, with specific reference to Islam, see Eickelman and Piscatori (Citation1996, 38ff).[4] On the emergence of the discourse of 'world religions', see also Masuzawa (Citation2005).[5] I focus here on the state, but other organisations too have linguistic or religious policies. Examples include English-only rules in workplaces; policies adopted by employers to provide for the 'reasonable accommodation' of employees' religious beliefs and practices (Ringelheim, Bribosia, and Rorive Citation2010); and policies and practices of prisons to provide religious services to inmates (Beckford and Gilliat Citation2005).[6] This and the next paragraph draw on Brubaker (Citation2013).[7] Bader (Citation2007, 82ff); Danchin Citation2012. For a different critique of the ideal of neutrality, see Mahmood (Citation2006). As I shall note below, the power to define what counts as 'religious' can enable states to circumvent well-institutionalised legal norms protecting the free exercise of religion and requiring the equal treatment of religions. On the broader debate in political theory about the ideal of state neutrality vis-\u00e0-vis competing understandings of the good, see Koppelman (Citation2004). Koppelman acknowledges the incoherence of the idea of complete neutrality, yet he affirms the continued relevance and value of neutrality as an ideal.[8] This is the domain of what Torpey (Citation2010) calls 'latent religiosity'.[9] This generates inequality within minority-language communities between monolinguals and bilinguals. Bilinguals who occupy key nodes in networks may profit from a monopolistic mediating position (see De Swaan Citation1988: chapter 3 for a sophisticated treatment of this in connection with the historical development of national languages and state education systems in Europe). Inequalities between monolinguals and bilinguals also transform authority structures and socioemotional patterns within families, notably when bilingual children must mediate for monolingual parents (Zhou and Bankston Citation1998, 170).[10] For seriously religious persons, to be sure, religion is\u2014at least ideally\u2014a universal medium of interaction. One's religious identity and commitments colour every interaction, and impose obligations\u2014or at least make relevant religious ideals\u2014at every moment. One is never outside the sphere of religion; indeed it makes no sense to think of religion as a separate sphere of life alongside other spheres. This may impose special burdens and specifically religious or religio-moral hazards for such persons when they are obliged to go outside the sphere of (serious) co-religionists. When this 'outside' world is deemed religiously dangerous\u2014notably for women, since such marking of the 'outside' world as morally and spiritually dangerous is often gendered\u2014opportunities may be severely restricted.[11] At stake in such struggles are not only core rights of religious belief and expression, but also privileges like exemption from taxation or exemption from military service on grounds of religious belief. Scientology, for example, was involved in a decades-long\u2014and ultimately successful\u2014battle with the Internal Revenue Service to be recognised as a religious organisation (Urban Citation2011). On the politics of defining 'religion', see Beckford (Citation2003) and Sullivan (Citation2005).[12] This point would have to be qualified in a fuller discussion. While religious beliefs are very strongly protected in liberal settings, the protection afforded religious practices is more qualified. Conduct that would otherwise be illegal or that can be construed as harming others, is not automatically protected by virtue of being characterised as 'religious'. For American constitutional jurisprudence on the 'free exercise' of religion, see Greenawalt (Citation2006). Moreover, there are signs that the neo-assimilationist turn in liberal politics (Brubaker Citation2001) extends increasingly to certain religious practices \u2013 or, more precisely, since the category \"religious\" is chronically contested, to practices that can be construed as religious by those engaging in them. In France, for example, citizenship can be withheld from applicants whose conduct or putative attitudes are judged incompatible with 'values essential to French society', and notably with equality between the sexes. Justifications for such refusals of citizenship have been carefully framed to avoid the appearance of discrimination on religious grounds, but the underlying concern with certain forms of religious practice seems clear (Bowen 2011; Hajjat Citation2011a, Citation2011b).[13] The following paragraphs draw on Brubaker (Citation2013).[14] Restrictions on proselytism are problematic in liberal contexts, where the free exercise of religion may be understood as entailing the freedom to proselytise. And efforts to protect prevailing but threatened religions are generally more problematic, in liberal polities, than efforts to protect prevailing but threatened languages\u2014yet another indicator of what Zolberg and Long (Citation1999) characterised as the asymmetrical stance of liberal states towards religious and linguistic pluralism.[15] On 'linguistic imperialism', see Phillipson (Citation1992).[16] Laitin (Citation1995) has analysed an interesting flipside of this. If religious or ethnic minorities are excluded, formally or informally, from a range of socially esteemed occupations, yet at the same time monopolise, formally or informally, certain stigmatised yet lucrative occupations or economic niches, the economic benefits of social marginality can solidify boundaries and inhibit processes of assimilation.[17] Obviously, people's linguistic and religious choices are not driven exclusively\u2014or even primarily\u2014by economic considerations. But choices are sensitive to the perceived advantages and disadvantages of different linguistic and religious repertoires, whether these are seen as deriving from political privileging or disprivileging, from economic valorisation or devalorisation, from cultural prestige or stigma or from informal social networks or discrimination. On the micro-sociology of language choice, see De Swaan (Citation2001, chapter 2), focusing not on economic value directly, but on the sensitivity of language choice to differences in the 'communication value' of different languages.[18] In liberal settings, where religious difference is generally less politically and economically disadvantaged than linguistic difference, especially in post-migration contexts, this logic of differential opportunity or advantage leads more routinely to changes in language repertoires than to changes in religious repertoires. Changes in religious repertoires are of course common in contemporary liberal settings, but they are generally driven by less pragmatic concerns. Where social inclusion has lagged behind legal emancipation, however, a pragmatic orientation to perceived advantages and disadvantages may lead to shifts in religious repertoires as well. In the last decades of Imperial Germany and the Habsburg Empire, for example, it was not uncommon for Jewish parents to have their children baptised as a strategy for overcoming limits on opportunities (Richarz Citation1998, 15).[19] The religious economies literature (critically reviewed in Chaves and Gorski Citation2001) has developed this ecological perspective, treating religious organisations as analogous to firms competing for customers.[20] For an ecological perspective on language competition, see Mufwene (Citation2002).[21] On such struggles between Czech-identified and German-identified organisations in East Central Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, see Zahra (Citation2008).[22] I refer to 'speakers' as shorthand for persons who use language in various ways, involving not only speaking (with varying degrees of competence and in varying domains) but also writing.[23] On the emerging field of language dynamics, in which language competition is formally modelled, see Wichmann (Citation2008).[24] A final step in the dynamic interplay between individual choices and aggregate patterns in the distribution of languages is that the increasing prevalence of a language\u2014an aggregate result of many individual choices sensitive to the value of that language\u2014can end up decreasing its value in certain contexts. English may be indispensable for many forms of mobility, but it has lost the scarcity that made it especially valuable in certain contexts, as for example in early post-communist Eastern Europe. This is similar to the logic of credential inflation and devaluation.[25] A sustained consideration of the factors accounting for the growth and decline of religions and languages is beyond the scope of the paper, but one observation may be made in passing. In liberal polities, the reproduction and growth of religious communities are less constrained and conditioned by demographic strength, economic value or state support than are the reproduction and growth of language communities. The growth of a religious community depends on its cultural content or 'message' in a way that the growth of a language community does not, notwithstanding the powerful symbolic associations that attach to particular languages. But in many other settings, political support and military power have been crucial to the growth of particular religions, just as they have been to the growth of particular languages.[26] A fuller treatment would address the issue of ideology, specifically the broad body of work on language ideology (reviewed in Woolard and Schieffelin Citation1994), and the debates about religion and ideology.[27] Of course a broad definition of the political and institutional domain might incorporate discourse and representations. But then one would still want to distinguish between processes that work through formal regulation (law, policy or procedure) in the state or formal organisations and processes that work through discourse and representation in the state but also outside the state.[28] Devaluation, stigmatisation and symbolic violence might seem to work rather similarly in the construction of religious authority, inducing the dominated to be complicit in their own domination by acknowledging the superior value and prestige of orthodox forms of belief and behaviour and devaluing their own forms of competence. Yet on closer inspection, symbolic devaluation and de-legitimation can be much more drastically consequential within religious than within linguistic traditions. Religious traditions are structures of authority, and religious authorities may control the means of physical as well as symbolic violence. Symbolic violence can thus prepare and legitimate physical violence. Heresy and apostasy, which may be punishable by death, have no counterpart in the domain of language. (One might think that issues of heresy and apostasy pertain to inequality within religious traditions, while I have been concerned here with inequality between languages and between religions. But this again shows that the distinction between 'within-religion' and 'between-religion'\u2014or within-language and between-language\u2014forms of inequality is not just an academic distinction, but a stake of practical struggles. What legitimately belongs to a religious tradition and what can be condemned as heretical, or as grounds for apostasy, can be a matter of life and death. The boundaries of a religion, and the distinction between inside and outside, are eminently practical questions.)[29] The term indexicality has not been used to designate this sort of devaluation by association in the domain of religion. Indexicality\u2014and Peiercean semiotics more broadly\u2014has been adopted in the sociology of religion in other contexts, notably by Rappaport (Citation1999).[30] It is important to recognise, to be sure, that religious traditions contain not only the cultural and symbolic resources for the authoritative stigmatisation and devaluation of outsiders, but also the cultural and symbolic resources for the de-stigmatisation and valorisation of outsiders (Stamatov Citation2014). So while religion lends itself to deeper and more totalising forms of othering than does language, it is also a potent source of criticism of, and opposition to, all forms of social exclusion.[31] Of course language too\u2014in traditions of analysis that reject the Saussurean distinction between langue and parole\u2014is shot through with power, authority and inequality. But religion is or can be a structure of authority\u2014of authoritative rules for the conduct of life, and authoritative judgments about doctrine and practice\u2014in a way that language is not.[32] The putative unassimilability, for example, may be understood to derive from the number of speakers, their concentration, their isolation in separate regions or institutions, their alleged cross-border nationalist sympathies or commitments or the availability of a dense network of mother-tongue institutions sustaining the language. The only feature of the language itself that could be even tangentially relevant to the claim of unassimilability would be the sheer linguistic distance from the prevailing language, which could make linguistic acculturation more difficult than it would be for speakers of another, more closely related language.[33] One might make an analogous argument about religion. One could argue, for example \u2014quite correctly, of course\u2014that violence is not intrinsic to Islam, any more than it is to Christianity, and that the putative dangers of Islam are not properties of the religion per se, but properties associated\u2014correctly or incorrectly\u2014with Islam in a particular social and political context. This is certainly true, as far as it goes; but it neglects the fact that wherever we draw the line between religion per se and all the things that are said or done in the name of a particular religion, or associated with a particular religion in a particular context, religion per se\u2014at least in the case of scriptural religions or those with differentiated structures of religious authority\u2014has a rich ideational, normative, cultural and political content that has no counterpart in the domain of language.[34] To underscore the relative normative and cultural 'thinness' of language vis-\u00e0-vis religion is not to deny that language may carry 'thicker' cultural meanings and commitments in some contexts than in others. See Carens (Citation2000, 128\u2013129) and Baub\u00f6ck (Citation2002, 177\u2013178) on 'thin' and 'thick' theories of language in relation to cultural commitments.[35] Of course, these often involve gross misrepresentations, highly selective and one-sided interpretations or essentialising readings that neglect the chronic struggles within highly differentiated religious traditions.[36] Members of stigmatised and subordinate categories, to be sure, need not simply internalise the stigma; they may instead challenge and contest dominant schemas of evaluation and appraisal through strategies of transvaluation (Wimmer Citation2013, 57\u201358) or de-stigmatisation (Lamont and Mizrachi Citation2012).[37] In the USA, language is not designated an impermissible grounds of employment discrimination, but national origin is. Since accent may indicate national origin, it can be illegal to discriminate on the basis of accent. However, employers may successfully defend themselves against the charge of discrimination if they can show that the accent 'interferes materially with job performance' (quoted in Lippi-Green Citation1994, 171).[38] This independence\u2014the fact that discrimination is prima facie economically irrational\u2014is what gave rise to the literature on the economics of discrimination (Becker Citation1971).[39] Discrimination has been studied empirically mainly with respect to race (Pager and Shepherd Citation2008), and chiefly, in recent years, through field studies (reviewed in Riach and Rich Citation2002) that seek to identify discrimination in gatekeeping encounters by systematically varying race while holding constant candidates' functionally relevant characteristics. Although field studies present methodological difficulties of their own, their quasi-experimental method seems clearly preferable to the statistical procedure of attributing residual differences in outcomes to discrimination, after controlling for other explanatory factors. A few field studies have addressed discrimination on the basis of religion, suggesting notably that Muslims face employment discrimination in France. One experiment (Adida, Laitin, and Valfort Citation2010) found that among matched job candidates with obviously Senegalese surnames, those with an obviously Catholic first name were 2.5 times more likely to be called back than those with an obviously Muslim first name. The experiment is ingenious, but it is not necessarily generalisable, since religion and country of origin cannot be neatly distinguished for the vast majority of Muslim migrants and their children in Europe.[40] The ways in which 'indexical' associations between language and social categories are implicated in the production and reproduction of inequality have been widely studied by sociolinguists, but the analogous phenomenon has received much less attention in the sociology of religion.[41] There is an interesting ambiguity here. The obligation to marry (or preference for marrying) a co-religionist is analytically distinct from the prohibition on marrying (or preference against marrying) a specific category of religious outsider. In the first case, outsiderhood is defined residually and as it were indiscriminately: all who are not co-religionists are outsiders. In the second case, outsiderhood is defined directly and in a discriminating fashion: it is specific categories of outsiders that are excluded. In both cases, discrimination is categorical: it works through categorically identified insiders in the first case and through categorically identified outsiders in the second. But we would probably hesitate to speak of 'discrimination' in the first case, especially where minorities are concerned, for example in the case of who obliged to marry other or Muslims in who obliged to marry other This into focus the between the that 'discrimination' a strongly and the that and the of cultural reproduction that may on certain forms of The of this on Brubaker chapter The distinction between driven and of linguistically inequality, to be sure, only to processes within particular not to the processes that have those The involved in and the of for example, have vast among the economic, political and social value of and devaluing The from and opportunities are they not only advantage those in the but those from them. work in the sociology of religion has more to the of religious social and religious boundaries On the ways in which network can inequality, see and religious norms with powerful for informal social norms about behaviour for be understood as norms that are only associated with religion in particular contexts.

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, populist parties have become a well-established part of many European party systems. Their rise has provoked extensive scholarly discussion aiming both at the conceptualization of and explanations for the reasons behind their electoral success, analyses of their electorate and the impact of populist political parties on the structure of party competition. Nevertheless, these conclusions have been derived from studies focusing either on the populist radical right (Betz 1994; Mudde 2007) or populist radical left parties/social populists (Barker 1998; March 2012), while the relatively new species of centrist populist political parties (Pop Eleches 2010; U\u010de\u0148 2004) has been neglected in this regard. The article contributes to filling the described gap in the research on populism by analysing the supporters of centrist populist parties (CPPs) in the Czech Republic. Certainly, the Czech Republic is not the only country that has experienced the emergence of CPPs, with Bulgaria (Cholova 2012), Slovakia (Sp\u00e1\u010d 2012) and the Baltic states (Balcere 2012) being other interesting cases. Moreover, Slovenia underwent a party system change of a similar intensity in the early 2010s. Nevertheless, there are serious doubts about the populist character of the newly emerged parties in Slovenia (Kra\u0161ovec 2012). Consequently, there are at least two reasons that make the Czech Republic a more suitable case for conducting an analysis of CPPs supporters. First, the Czech party system has experienced long-term stability. While the party system in the Czech Republic enjoyed a high level of stability until the emergence of the CPPs, both in terms of volatility and cleavage structure (Casal B\u00e9rtoa 2014; Powell and Tucker 2014), the rise of centrist populism in Slovakia took place in an environment of continuous change characterized by a transformation of the main political conflicts. Although it was possible to trace some signs of stability in Bulgaria before 2001, the level of both extra-system and intra-system volatility was considerably higher in comparison to the Czech case (Powell and Tucker 2014). The argument about the higher level of volatility applies to the Baltic countries as well. The second reason for this is the richness of empirical material. The analysis is based on an examination of how different factors shape support for CPPs in comparison to support for the established parties that have been present in the Czech party system since the 1990s (ODS, \u010cSSD, KS\u010cM, and KDU-\u010cSL). Both parties analysed here can be described as centrist populist. All the same, they differed in proposed solutions, which had implications for the profile of their voters and it is also important for the discussion about both the unique species of centrist populist parties and populist political parties in general, as we will later show. The paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce the concept of centrist populism as part of a description of the rise of the new CPPs in the context of the relative stability of Czech party politics. Second, employing the most widely used approaches in electoral behaviour research, we will analyse who supports CPPs. Since there has been very little effort dedicated to the analysis of CPPs, we seek to test various approaches in order to understand the electoral base of the new populist challengers in the Czech Republic. We then describe our data and our method of analysis before presenting the results. Our conclusion sums up our findings and considers their implications. It has become some sort of a clich\u00e9 to state that there are very few terms in the contemporary comparative political research as contested as populism (Canovan 1999; Stanley 2008). Nevertheless, recent research has led to the emergence of a consensus on the \"nucleus of populism\" (Rooduijn 2014) constituted around three interrelated elements: 1) the virtuous people that are 2) betrayed by the essentially bad/corrupt elites, and 3) the restoration of the people`s sovereignty allegedly driven by populists themselves. As Stanley stated, the \"thin nature [of populist ideology] means that it is unable to stand alone as a practical political ideology: it lacks the capacity to put forward a wide-ranging and coherent programme for the solution to crucial political questions\" (Stanley 2008: 95). Indeed, history has shown a wide variety of populist actors that reflected the specifics of the environment, in which they arose, including populist radical right parties, agrarian populism and social populism (Pauwels 2014) as the most prominent empirical expressions of the \"chameleonic\" (Taggart 2004: 275) populist ideology. At the end of the 1990s, however, East-Central Europe witnessed the emergence of political parties, which lacked a clear ideological foundation and, at the same time, expressed very strong populist appeals. The term CPP has been used to capture the unusual identity of these new political parties based solely on populist appeals. In his analysis of party politics in post-communist Europe, Grigore Pop-Eleches (2010) defined new/centrist populism as one of the four types of unorthodox parties. New/centrist populist parties do not present a radical ideology. In contrast, they try to sidestep any ideology altogether and claim that they represent a non-ideological, anti-political alternative to the established parties. Their programmes are based on the claim that they fight the corrupt elite and pursue the interests of the people, promising to enhance living standards. As Pop-Eleches states (2010: 231), \"such parties are almost completely unencumbered by ideological constraints and are therefore free to tell the voters what they want to hear\".2 Similarly, Peter U\u010de\u0148 (2004) used the term centrist populism to describe political parties that entered the Slovak parliament in the 1998 and 2002 general elections. U\u010de\u0148 explains the \"centrism\" of these populist parties in terms of their self-presentation as alternatives to mainstream parties without taking extremist positions and being located \"directly or indirectly [in] the ideological or geometric centre of the party system.\" (U\u010de\u0148 2004: 47). Not only do these parties not present extreme or radical political attitudes, they lack a clear ideological profile altogether. Therefore, instead of a coherent ideology, the appeal of CPPs is often based on the promised competence of the leader, or on the claim to increase the participation of the people in the policy-making process. Both variants are supposed to lead to the same outcome \u2013 a better representation of the people. Going back to Stanley`s argument (Stanley 2008), CPPs lack a clear and coherent host ideology, the core of their identity is populism itself and solutions stemming from it, be they a competent leader, \"common sense\" or introduction of different forms of participatory or direct democracy. After the fall of communism and the first \"grounding years\" characterized by the turbulent development of political parties, Czech party politics became one of the most stable party systems in Central and Eastern Europe, typified by low levels of volatility (Powell and Tucker 2014) and a structure of well-institutionalized party competition established around the dominant left-right divide (Casal B\u00e9rtoa 2014; Hlou\u0161ek and Kope\u010dek 2008). However, the 2010 and 2013 parliamentary elections called the previous stability of party politics into question (Havl\u00edk 2015a; Hanley 2011). The most spectacular feature of the general elections in 2010 and in 2013 was the success of CPPs, namely of Public Affairs (V\u011bci ve\u0159ejn\u00e9, VV) and Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (Akce nespokojen\u00fdch ob\u010dan\u016f, ANO) \u2013 see Table 1.3 On the contrary, TOP 09 \u2013 another newcomer from the 2010 general election \u2013 is not a part of the analysis. Although TOP 09 showed some elements of an anti-establishment appeal and an anti-corruption agenda, the anti-establishment appeal was not in the core of the profile of the party. The party presented itself as a \"purifier\" seeking to heal a right-wing part of the spectrum. As S\u00e9an Hanley (2011: 124) put it, TOP 09 \"tried to present itself primarily as representatives of the mainstream centre-right, offering purer versions of conservatism or liberal conservatism [\u2026], as actors that could fix the failure of the established parties to transform the Czech Republic into a modern Western-like market-based society\". In other words, TOP 09 does not see itself as an alternative to all established parties (as the CPPs did) but merely as an alternative in the centre-right part of the party system. Similarly, Tomio Okamura`s Dawn of Direct Democracy (6.9% of votes in the 2013 general election) was also not included in the analysis, as the profile of the party was not clear before the election, and and its occasionally anti-Roma statements placed it close to the family of populist radical right parties. What the two CPPs had in common was a strong anti-establishment appeal, which depicted the old political parties as incompetent and corrupt. Indeed, corruption was presented as the most important feature of the established parties and the way they approach politics and governance (Havl\u00edk 2015b). VV, for instance, called politicians from the entire political spectrum \"robber barons\" or \"political dinosaurs\", i.e. those \"who [have] been in politics for more than ten years, can't do anything other than politics, [understand] it as his trade and [start] to make deals.\u2026 who['ve] lost touch with reality and [ceased] to be useful.\" (Pr\u00e1vo 2009) Three years later, ANO spoke of the \"corrupt system of political parties\" (ANO 2013). Both parties can be classified as populist \u2013 using strong anti-establishment appeals to construct a moral division between the two homogeneous groups \u2013 the \"pure people\" and \"the corrupt elite\" (Mudde 2004; Stanley 2008), although the purity of the people expressed mostly through numerous references to the common sense of the people and their ability to make right decisions was more visible in the case of VV than in the case of ANO (Havl\u00edk 2015b). All the same, none of the Czech populist newcomers presented a coherent programme in terms of \"host ideologies\". Instead, VV stated that it pursued \"common sense\" in contrast to standard ideological solutions, claiming that \"ideologies are totally empty\" (\u010cesk\u00e1 televize 2010). Similarly, ANO's electoral platform was typical of the high proportion of valence issues as opposed to positional issues (Eibl 2014), and they stressed common sense, and added an emphasis on \"simple and effective managing of the state\" (ANO 2013). In other words, the populist appeals and programmatic vagueness of the two new political parties fit the definition of CPPs. Since there have not been any systemic CPP studies published of yet, our study is partly explanatory in its character, relying on both the established literature on populist voting and on the specifics of the supply side of the CPPs described above. The literature has provided many explanations for why people vote for populist political parties. We agree with Pauwels, who stated that \"there is no reason to believe that 'populist voters' would make their choice fundamentally different from other voters\" (Pauwels 2014: 53). Because it is reasonable to expect that specific populist factors drive the concrete voting choice, we use socio-demographic voting (i.e. cleavage-based), protest voting, issue voting, spatial and valence voting to explain the electoral support of CPPs in the Czech Republic. The sociological approach which emphasises the importance of people's social positions has a long tradition in the study of voting behaviour, going back to research conducted in the 1940s in the United States and to cleavage theory (Lipset and Rokkan 1967). The main assumption is that voting behaviour is shaped by social divides such as social class, religion or by place of residence. A social divide has to have three dimensions (structural, normative and organizational) to be considered a cleavage. In this part, we deal only with the structural dimension when we examine the effect of social structure. Deegan-Krause (2006) calls this aspect of cleavage voting the census divide. The results of the research applying a sociological approach to the study of populist parties show that these parties are supported by the \"losers of modernization\" (Betz 1994) who face the changes in social dynamics with difficulties, as a consequence of the \"integration-demarcation\" cleavage (Kriesi et al. 2008). Indeed, empirical research has shown the overrepresentation of some groups in society among voters of populist radical right parties that are supported by male, less educated, unskilled workers or members of the old middle class (Ivarsflaten 2005; Lubbers et al. 2002). Regarding the analysis of voting for CPPs, the problem is that these studies were focused on populist radical right parties. Similarly, the results of analyses of radical left populist parties, which describe their supporters as unemployed, less educated people are hardly applicable to CPPs. H1: The effect of the sociodemographic characteristics of voters will be lower in explaining of support for CPPs in comparison to support for the established4 political parties. Segments of the population, as determined by the census, are interconnected with political values. Basically, a value is an enduring belief that a specific mode of conduct or end-state of existence is preferable to the opposite modes or end-states (Rokeach 1973). Therefore, values can be seen as guidelines of peoples' attitudes and behaviour regarding political issues (Campbell et al. 1960; Fuchs and Klingemann 1990). In the literature, two types of political values are often distinguished. Values connected to opposite sides of the \"old\" socio-political cleavages (Lipset and Rokkan 1967) are usually labelled as old political values. The second category captures new political values including Inglehart's materialist/post-materialist values, environmental and economic growth values and libertarian/authoritarian values. Moreover, in the area of the former east bloc, the communism/post-communism dimension is important (Hlou\u0161ek and Kope\u010dek 2008). The literature shows that values are an important factor in the explanation of support for right wing populist parties. Oesch (2008) frames this explanation as \"cultural\", with attitudes towards community and identity playing a crucial role (Kitschelt and McGann 1997). The emergence of RPPs thus represent the authoritarian response to the dominance of libertarian values and multicultural models of living (Ignazi 1992; Minkenberg 2001). Accordingly, it is argued that the RPPs' success is explained by people's unease about the cultural challenges posed by the inflow and presence of an increasing number of foreign residents. H2: The effect of value voting will be lower in explanation of support for CPPs in comparison to support for the established political parties. Another approach explaining why people vote for populist parties is based on issue voting, linked mostly to the host ideology of populism. In contrast to value voting, issue voting is driven rather by the actual situation (see Carmines and Stimson 1980), whereas value voting reflects one's persistent patterns of thinking (Knutsen and Kumlin 2005). Deegan-Krause (2006) differentiates between value voting and issue voting more subtly. He uses the term \"attitudinal voting\" to refer to \"normative\" or \"value\" categories of cleavage voting. The word \"issues\" then refers to the interplay between attitude and partisanship. Van der Brug et al. (2000) and Ford and Goodwin (2014) point out the anti-immigration positions of voters of populist radical right parties in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. Pauwels (2014) identified the demand for a more regulatory role of the state in the economy as one of the drivers of voting for the populist left in Germany and in the Netherlands. While immigration, law and order and protectionist economy are not important issues for CPPs, the issue of corruption is a focal point of their populist discourse (Pop-Eleches 2010; U\u010de\u0148 2007). As shown by Hanley and Sikk (2016), corruption was an important contextual factor behind the electoral success of anti-establishment reform parties in Central and Eastern Europe. Similarly, Engler (2016) showed an important effect of the perceived relative level of corruption on the electoral fortunes of new political parties, including the new populist challengers. H3: Voters who perceive corruption to be a salient issue are more likely to support CPPs. H4: Voters who perceive CPPs to be more competent in solving the most salient political issues are more likely to support them in comparison to the established political parties. H5a: Voters who evaluate the past state of the country economy negatively are more likely to support CPPs. H5b: Voters who evaluate their future economic situation negatively are more likely to support CPPs. Political cynicism has had a prominent position in the study of populist voting. This is not surprising if we take into consideration the core of populism defined by people-centrism closely tied to strong anti-establishment appeals. Nevertheless, the question of how to define the targets of the populist protest vote are First, a populist protest appeal negatively targets the representatives of established political parties who are usually depicted as and of the people, and thus a specific political class Although populism does not as such (Mudde and 2012), populist is at the face of i.e. the of as in political by the established parties (Canovan In his analysis of the populist radical right in (2006) showed the of political on the vote for Similarly, Pauwels see also Oesch identified the of low political and with on different populist political parties in Germany and the Netherlands. As shown by and in their study of voters for populist parties, protest attitudes voters for populist parties from voters for mainstream parties\" and On the other (2008) and der Brug et al. (2000) not that political cynicism is a common feature for voting for populist radical right parties. Although it that the of political cynicism on the support of populist parties the appeal at the of by the established parties has had a importance in the discourse of CPPs in the Czech while a coherent ideological Voters who do not politicians are more likely to support CPPs. Voters with low with are more likely to support CPPs.

This article synthesizes and extends a suite of conceptual frameworks, research findings, and practice-based knowledge into an integrative framework for collaborative governance. The framework specifies a set of nested dimensions that encompass a larger system context, a collaborative governance regime, and its internal collaborative dynamics and actions that can generate impacts and adaptations across the systems. The framework provides a broad conceptual map for situating and exploring components of cross-boundary governance systems that range from policy or program-based intergovernmental cooperation to place-based regional collaboration with nongovernmental stakeholders to public-private partnerships. The framework integrates knowledge about individual incentives and barriers to collection action, collaborative social learning and conflict resolution processes, and institutional arrangements for cross-boundary collaboration. It is presented as a general framework that might be applied to analyses at different scales, in different policy arenas, and varying levels of complexity. The article also offers 10 propositions about the dynamic interactions among components within the framework and concludes with a discussion about the implications of the framework for theory, research, evaluation, and practice.",

      "abstract": "Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Swiss political system became firmly anchored in three principles of governance: sovereignty, proximity of decision-makers and citizens, and elite consensus. The contributions to this special issue of the Swiss Political Science Review explore to what extent these three principles still adequately describe the functioning and political culture of this country. In our introduction, we discuss the forces that challenge the Swiss political system on all three principles, as well as their consequences in terms of a new, less \"enchanted\" mode of governance that characterizes Swiss Politics at the beginning of the 21st century. How and in what forms have the three principles of sovereignty, proximity of politics and citizens, and elite consensus developed over time? The modern Swiss state of 1848, transformed from a previously loose confederation, has put a strong emphasis on federalism and subsidiarity, guaranteeing sovereignty and political autonomy of the cantons towards the center. Similarly, Swiss foreign politics after the WWII has been connected to the image of full-fledged sovereignty. Both within Switzerland, as well as in its embedment in the international system, we find the prevalence of state and politics proximate to the citizens. The small scale-societies (Kleingesellschaften) of the cantons and municipalities remained comparatively weak states, with an even weaker bureaucracy, and largely depended on extended voluntary self-administration, and on private associations (Linder 1999, 32-6). This found its reflection in the principle that Swiss politics is not professionalized, and offices held by volunteers or part-time MPs (the Milizsystem). Towards the turn of the 20th century, the development of extended direct democratic rights also at the federal level just reinforced this tight and direct link between citizens and policy-makers. Institutionally, numerous veto points \u2013 especially the enhanced use of direct democracy at the federal level since the late 19th century \u2013 imposed constraints for political moderation and elite-accommodation in the form of inclusive decision-making structures. The gradual political inclusion of the opposition has culminated - in the second half of the 20th century - in a system that was addressed as consociational democracy (Lijphart 1968; Lehmbruch 1967) with corporatist decision-making (Katzenstein 1985; Kriesi 1980). In Switzerland itself, the Zauberformel (\"magic formula\") for the government composition became the symbol for political inclusion. This model of Swiss democracy, and its three \"enchanted principles\" \u2013 sovereignty, proximity to the citizens, and elite consensus \u2013 has enjoyed very high popular legitimacy ever since, and provided for stability. This special issue deals with the changes, which the Swiss model of democracy has experienced since the late 20th century. Have these three principles become 'disenchanted'? What are the main features of Swiss democracy at the beginning of the 21st century? Why have things changed and what consequences should we expect from the changes we observe? With regards to sovereignty, the contributions by Eggenberger and Emmenegger and by Jenni provide striking accounts of an increase of political interdependence, which puts in question the uncompromised national sovereignty. While Swiss federalism is today characterized by intense cooperation between the cantons, Wasserfallen argues that cantons still strongly compete in fiscal matters. Regarding proximity to citizens, we argue that this aspect still is highly present in Swiss politics, as testified by the increasing use and continuing popularity of direct democracy. Three reservations are in order, however: first, part-time politicians and volunteers have given way to professionalized elites (as shown by Bailer and B\u00fctikofer). Second, mediatization has increased (Udris, Lucht and Schneider) and third, direct democracy (see the contribution by Leemann) tends to become undermined by an increase of popular initiatives that result from electoral competition. Finally, elite consensus is examined by Afonso and Papadopoulos, Beste, Wyss and B\u00e4chtiger, Bochsler and Bousbah, Bornschier, Leemann, and Traber. They all clearly show that conflict has strongly increased in the Swiss political system. Alliances in parliament have become both more diverse and less inclusive and, in particular, the SVP has changed the tone in the political discourse in parliament. Even though Switzerland still displays the institutions of consociational democracy, the political practice in this country matches the picture of an ideal-typical consociation much less than thirty years ago. What have been the main factors driving political change in the last 40 years? Beyond technological and demographic change and mediatization, we consider two factors to be the main drivers for change of Swiss democracy: polarization and integration. By polarization, we mean strong divergence among political parties on the key political questions. Polarization in Switzerland has increased as a result of the pluralization of political parties and economic interest groups. In the 1970s and 1980s, new social movements and new parties entered the political scene with a libertarian-progressive agenda. They deeply changed the left by adding a socio-cultural agenda to the traditionally state-interventionist program of the left (Kitschelt 1994). And \u2013 as shown by Bornschier and Leemann in this volume \u2013 they triggered a reaction on the right: new political parties on the radical right side were founded in the early 1990s, and the Swiss People's Party (SVP) started its transformation into a more radical, national-conservative right-wing populist party. These dynamics have broken the traditional alliance of the moderate right-wing parties on which the Swiss government coalition was built, while political-economic changes (internationalization and deindustrialization) have weakened the political cohesiveness of the economic interest groups (Mach 1999). The fragmentation of the right both among parties and economic interest groups has unravelled the stable alliance of right-wing parties and business (B\u00fcrgerblock) that had dominated Swiss Politics for a long time. Several contributions in this volume (see e.g. Leemann, Bornschier and Afonso and Papadopoulos) and in other places (e.g. Vatter 2014, 147) (Ladner 2014, 372) emphasize the increase in party polarization as the key factor that has thrown a spanner in the works of the Swiss political system. Yet, it is primarily when locating current Swiss party polarization in the international context that the extent of deviation from a moderate, consensus-oriented political system becomes strikingly visible (see also Armingeon and Engler 2015). To this effect, we show in Figure 1 the extent of party polarization in Switzerland and all other European democracies regarding the two main axes of political conflict in Europe, the economic and the socio-cultural dimension1. We rely on expert survey data for this purpose, and calculate the weighted standard deviation of the distribution of parties on each axis (Dalton 2008, 906).2 Figure 1 shows that Switzerland is among the most polarized party systems in Europe, not only regarding economic issues, but also regarding socio-cultural policies. Party polarization on economic and socio-cultural issues Figure 2 complements this first impression by providing the mean location of the main Swiss parties (over 5% vote share in the 2011 elections) compared to the mean location of the other main parties of Western Europe. The size of the circles is proportional to the vote share this party reached in the last parliamentary national election before August 2015. What distinguishes Switzerland (parties marked in bold font) from other countries is that the strongest parties are also the most polarized ones: the Green Party and the Social Democrats are at opposite poles of the Swiss People's Party both on economic and on cultural issues. Party positions in the two-dimensional political space Longitudinal analyses (Hug & Schulz 2007) indeed show that polarization, measured on a single left-right dimension, has increased over the last thirty years. Bornschier (2015) shows that the shift in polarization has substantially improved the issue congruence between parties and voters, especially regarding cultural issues. With his work, Bornschier extends the understanding of recent research: By looking at general preferences, Armingeon and Engler (2015) argue that voters are less polarized than the elites. Bornschier looks at actual policy preferences regarding cultural and economic policies and finds that both, the elite and the electorate are polarized. People seem to prefer moderate positions in general and distinguish more in the specific proposals. Furthermore, the increased polarization \u2013 together with commercialization \u2013 has also left its footprint regarding the mediatization of politics (Udris et al. 2015), and the functioning of the Swiss institutions (in particular Bochsler and Bousbah, Traber, Afonso and Papadopoulos 2015), and altered the political culture (Beste et al., 2015). The second main driver of change in the Swiss political system is integration. Integration refers to the fact that political problems or issues increasingly transcend sub-national or national borders, that problems have become more complex, and political unities have \u2013 in the wake of these processes - become more interdependent. Economically, interdependence is nothing new for Switzerland. It has always been a \"small open economy\" (Katzenstein 1985), with foreign trade shares above the OECD-average already in the 1960s, but the share has steadily increased over time (see Figure 3). Total trade (import and export) as % of GDP in Switzerland and Western OECD countries (average) 1960-2011 In terms of this trade, the EU is by far the most important trade partner for Switzerland. Exports to EU countries account for almost double of exports to all other regions in the world. And this is where economic integration meets political integration: The EU countries have become much more strongly integrated both economically and politically over the past decades. In Switzerland, a spectacular increase in treaties, agreements and regulations with the EU (see Jenni this issue) testifies to the increased interdependence Swiss politics is exposed to and has to deal with. The same applies to the strengthened political integration in other international organizations, such as the OECD, which strongly and effectively affect Swiss politics (see Eggenberger and Emmenegger in this volume). In this section, we discuss in more detail how polarization and integration have challenged and partly changed the key mechanisms of Swiss politics in terms of sovereignty, proximity between decision-makers and citizens, and elite consensus. During the second half of the 20th century, the Swiss elites have portrayed the country as a politically neutral island, with maximal political sovereignty. Although economically highly integrated, the Swiss were hesitant to make any step of political integration (Kriesi and Trechsel 2008, 21-3). At the sub-national level, the Swiss cantons kept their strong political identities (Gruner 1977, 50; Kriesi and Trechsel 2008, 12) and celebrated their traditional far-reaching autonomy, and the sacrosanct principle of subsidiarity. But the picture of the inviolable political sovereignty \u2013 both at the national and subnational levels \u2013 suffers. It is challenged by the end of the bipolar international system after the Cold War, the European integration process, but also by socio-economic integration across borders. With the continued disappearance of cantonal press, and with parties losing their cantonal strongholds, the cantons also lose their distinct political identities (Armingeon 1998; Bochsler and Sciarini 2006). As this special issue shows, the cantons were at least as successful in defending their autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis the federal state and the European Union, as the federal state was vis-\u00e0-vis its international neighbours. The contribution by Wasserfallen analyses the interdependence of taxation policies between the Swiss cantons. Cantons compete with each other on tax issues, aiming for the best tax payers. Wasserfallen shows that competition between cantons evolves in cycles, determined by (vertical) negotiations between the cantons and the federal level. In periods of vertical negotiations with the federal state, the cantons put competition on hold, and instead cooperate horizontally, in order to strengthen their position against the federal state, only to start competing again, once the vertical negotiations have ended. As social and economic integration makes cantonal borders increasingly irrelevant and ill-suited to the challenges at hand, horizontal coordination between the cantons becomes a crucial feature of federalism in Switzerland. While formally keeping their autonomy, the cantons need to coordinate horizontally, in order to speak with a single voice towards the federal authorities and the European Union (H\u00e4usermann 2003), but also in order to succeed in effective policy-making, which increasingly requires solutions beyond cantonal borders, leading to a considerable increase of inter-cantonal agreements over the course of the last four decades (see Bochsler 2009). This same tension between keeping political sovereignty, but de-facto integration across borders is even more challenging to traditional Swiss democracy in the process of EU integration. Sabine Jenni has systematically analysed the legal integration of EU norms into the Swiss legislation. The most visible legal acts are the sectoral agreements, which Switzerland has agreed on with the EU. However, Jenni shows that the politicization of the European integration process in domestic party politics has become a major obstacle for such sectoral agreements. Since 2004, alternative mechanisms of norm adaptation have become more important: inter-governmental committees behind closed doors and indirect adaptation of national laws and regulations to EU norms, both less affected by the intricacies and adversities of domestic party competition, but clearly indicative of a loss in domestic sovereignty. This is also reflected in the comparison of two studies of decision-making in Switzerland: In the 1970s, out of the 13 most important decision-making processes, only one (the trade on with the was (Kriesi 1980). by Sciarini et al. (2015) finds thirty years over a of the most important decision-making processes by the were In a that an important also for Switzerland as a Switzerland is far more on and with its international Similarly, the regulations in the provide an account of the between international and domestic political In their Eggenberger and Emmenegger the reaction of Switzerland and to new international norms regarding tax policies and regulations after the of the economic between economic the Swiss business associations to on a to the towards the Swiss As a politics to the leading to a on the As a the Swiss towards international remained much more and as the much more than the reaction by The between international and domestic politics also in direct democracy a or an with international (Linder 2014, the contributions to our volume that deal with the question of sovereignty show that horizontal as between cantons and between Switzerland and the works well but they to once cooperation becomes or not for of they provide a striking picture of regarding national and sub-national a long two have provided for a high proximity of Swiss citizens to their political the of a of direct democratic and the principle that political offices are voluntary or part-time elites to in their after political While both principles have partly in the 21st century, they have changed their the use of popular initiatives has increased at the national level, since the shows that the use of initiatives has been largely by electoral competition and by in terms of to the size of the The actual use of the right the that direct democracy is in the of the citizens. parties government and politicians increasingly use direct democratic rights as a for electoral competition.

      "abstract": "Abstract The article explores the strategic and political parameters influencing the ways in which the main economic interest groups become involved in policy in contemporary Greece. The fact that social dialogue in Greece remains an exercise with a limited scope has been largely due to the fact that there is a difficult match between Greece's 'disjointed corporatism' and the EU's emerging 'competitive corporatism'. A number of European trade unions have agreed to a new 'competitive bargain', which is asymmetrical but which gives them the opportunity to get involved in 'competitive corporatism'. Greek responses to this trend have been inconclusive: while there are clearly pockets within union leaderships which would welcome the opportunity to approve the basic liberalising goals in exchange for guarantees for established workers and participation in the political framing of their implementation, the structural features of the Greek interest intermediation system work against such a possibility. Whether this leads to an evolving 'segmented pluralism' or another form remains to be seen \u2013 the extent of the synchronicity of developments with other EU states will depend in part on the outcome of this transition. In previous decades, the country's transition from asymmetric state corporatism to disjointed corporatism went through the contours of an embracing strategy of Europeanisation. It is an open question whether an equivalent strategy for the twenty-first century will be able to restructure the socio-political scene. Notes Meaning, literally, 'guilds' \u2013 a pejorative signifier in public discourse, aiming to convey the supposedly closed, protected and inward-looking nature of interest organisations.

The Labour Home operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour and is responsible for the management of funds generated from the contributions of employers and employees. Fragmentation in the system of interest groups assumes two forms. First, there is the great number of primary-level unions (c. 7000) and the weak links between the primary level and the higher levels. Second, there is also considerable fragmentation along party-political lines. Although this fragmentation in most cases does not express itself at the level of peak associations, even within a single organisational structure (such as the GSEE) there exist powerful political factions (PASKE, DAKE, ESAK-S, AEM), which represent the views of the respective political parties within the association. In Greece and more generally in Southern Europe, interest fragmentation goes hand in hand with strong party influences within unions (Schmitter 1995 Schmitter Philippe, C 1995 Organized Interests and Democratic Consolidation in Southern Europe in Richard Gunther, Nikiforos P. Diamandouros and Hans-J\u00fcrgen Puhle (eds.), The Politics of Democratic Consolidation: Southern Europe in Comparative Perspective, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 284 314 [Google Scholar]). But the organisational forms of interest representation at the peak level have remained unitary in the Greek case. On the organisation of other economic and professional interests see Lavdas (1997 Lavdas Kostas, A 1997 The Europeanization of Greece: Interest Politics and the Crises of Integration London: Macmillan [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]; 2001 Lavdas Kostas, A 2001 Griechenland: Verbande und Politik in Werner Reutter and Peter Rutters (eds.), Verbande und Verbandssysteme in Westeuropa, Opladen: UTB fur Wissenschaft and Leske & Budrich 151 69 [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]; 2004 Lavdas Kostas, A 2004 [Interests, Politics and Democracy] Athens: Papazisis [Google Scholar]), Kioukias (1994 Kioukias Dimitris 1994 [The Organization of Interests in Greece: Integration and Access to the State] Athens: Exantas [Google Scholar]) and Tsinisizelis (1996 Tsinisizelis Michalis, J 1996 Greece in Dietrich Rometsch and Wolfgang Wessels (eds.), TheEuropean Union and Member States: Towards an Institutional Fusion, Manchester: Manchester University Pres 216 52 [Google Scholar]). It is often the case that the process through which members of business groups form their views on their self-interest is an interactive process and depends on particular political and associational conditions (Vogel 1978 Vogel, David. 1978. Why Businessmen Distrust their State: The Political Consciousness of American Corporate Executives. British Journal of Political Science, 8:1: 45\u201378. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). In Greece, the prevalence of politicised linkages between economic actors and governmental institutions influenced business groups towards a state-oriented and often particularistic mentality. In turn, this mentality became an obstacle to further associational development. Since 1974, the influence of the issue of EC/EU membership (and prospective membership) became an important stimulus in (a) transforming certain policy aspects of the environment of business activity, while also (b) encouraging the organisational development of more professionalised practices for the mediation of business interests (Lavdas 1996 Lavdas Kostas, A 1996 The Political Economy of Privatization in Southern Europe in Derek Braddon and Deborah Foster (eds.), Privatization: Social Sciences, Themes and Perspectives Aldershot: Dartmouth.

The institutional continuities with the system before 1967 and the very slow evolution of legal and institutional forms, create difficulties for the analytical approach to the Greek case from a comparative perspective. Be that as it may, in terms of behavioural and actual political capacities, the combination of extensive but weak state structures, the legacy of asymmetric state corporatism, comprehensive but internally fragmented interest structures and party-political influences would lead to the characterisation of the Greek case as one of 'disjointed corporatism' (Lavdas 1997 Lavdas Kostas, A 1997 The Europeanization of Greece: Interest Politics and the Crises of Integration London: Macmillan [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) possibly leading to 'segmented pluralism' (Lanza and Lavdas 2000 Lanza, Orazio and Lavdas A, Kostas. 2000. The Disentanglement of Interest Politics. European Journal of Political Research, 37:2: 203\u201335. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). It is crucial to distinguish between (a) the utilisation of certain consociational practices and (b) the operation of a consociational system characterised by comprehensive institutionalised rules, which aim to promote effective decision-making through compromise politics. Such a system may create the conditions for societal corporatist arrangements, although the development and sustainability of the latter will depend also on the organisational properties and strategies of interests (that is, a consociational system provides a facilitating background for societal corporatism, but the latter is not simply a dimension of consociationalism: it presupposes features that are specific to interest politics and policy). On the links between consociational traditions and successful societal corporatism and concertation in policy-making see Scholten (1987 Scholten Ilja ed 1987 Political Stability and Neo-Corporatism London: Sage [Google Scholar]). Long-established clientelistic relationships have been transforming themselves, moving in the direction of a form of clientelism in which the roles of political parties and of party\u2013state relationships become decisive (Charalambis 1989 Charalambis Dimitris 1989 [Clientelistic Linkages and Populism] Athens: Exantas [Google Scholar]). Preferential relationships developing in this way within the political system tend to favour mutual public\u2013private transformations in the direction of a closed, segmented and oligopolistic pluralism. An interesting comparative example is provided by the relationships between politics and associations which existed in Italy before 1992 (Lanza and Lavdas 2000 Lanza, Orazio and Lavdas A, Kostas. 2000. The Disentanglement of Interest Politics. European Journal of Political Research, 37:2: 203\u201335. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). In Greece, the party alternation in government in 1981 was not only a crucial test for the consolidation of democracy but also a crucial factor in putting pressure on interest groups, making them search for a more detached position in the political system. Of course, such 'positive' influences have been objective rather than intentional on the part of the PASOK governments in the 1980s: in government, PASOK continued the practice of state interference in the internal affairs of GSEE (Spourdalakis 1988 Spourdalakis Michalis 1988 The Rise of the Greek Socialist Party London: Routledge [Google Scholar]: 246\u201349) resulting in an internal crisis within the GSEE. For analysis of the PASOK phenomenon see Spourdalakis (1988 Spourdalakis Michalis 1988 The Rise of the Greek Socialist Party London: Routledge [Google Scholar]; 1998 Spourdalakis Michalis 1998 PASOK: The Telling Story of a Unique Organizational Structure in Piero Ignazi and Colette Ysmal (eds.), The Organization of Political Parties in Southern Europe, Westport, CT: Praeger 202 20 [Google Scholar]) Gravaris (1998 Gravaris Dionysis 1998 ' [The Building of the Welfare State] in Michalis Spourdalakis (ed.), [PASOK: Party, State, Society], Athens: Patakis 92 125 [Google Scholar]) and the contributions in Clogg (1993 Clogg Richard ed 1993 Greece 1981\u201389: The Populist Decade London: Macmillan [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). As mentioned, Greek business presented a striking organisational and strategic contrast to Greek labour: it retained much of its organisational autonomy from the state and was able to develop considerable capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis political institutions. Aspects of this asymmetry and its implications can be found in a number of policy areas, from shipping and transport to industrial relations and social policy (see, inter alia, Vernardakis and Mavris 1991 Vernardakis Christoforos Mavris Jiannis 1991 [Parties and Social Coalitions in Pre-Dictatorial Greece] Athens: Exantas [Google Scholar]; Stamatis 1995 Stamatis Giorgos ed 1995 [For a Critique of Social Sciences] Athens: Kritiki [Google Scholar]; Lavdas 1997 Lavdas Kostas, A 1997 The Europeanization of Greece: Interest Politics and the Crises of Integration London: Macmillan [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]; Gravaris 1998 Gravaris Dionysis 1998 ' [The Building of the Welfare State] in Michalis Spourdalakis (ed.), [PASOK: Party, State, Society], Athens: Patakis 92 125 [Google Scholar]; 2002 Gravaris Dionysis 2002 ' [The Demand for Political Modernisation] in [Ideological Currents and Intellectual Trends in Today's Greece], Athens: Sakis Karayiorgas Foundation 330 56 [Google Scholar]). If the social partners reach agreement, the Council of Ministers can give the ensuing text the force of law. If they are unable to reach agreement, the Council may proceed with legislation of its own (the 'negotiate or we will legislate' threat).

In the 1980s in particular, the influence of European processes was combined with domestic attempts at decentralisation and regional reform put forward by the PASOK governments. The major beneficiaries of these reforms, apart from the interest groups, which were mentioned above, have been the localities themselves and their political, administrative and technocratic personnel (Kioukias 1994 Kioukias Dimitris 1994 [The Organization of Interests in Greece: Integration and Access to the State] Athens: Exantas [Google Scholar]: 202\u20133). In this process, regional and local authorities also acquire ever-greater degrees of autonomy and ability to act as interest groups in the wider European policy arenas. To the extent, that is, that their success required social relations other than pure markets, on the one hand, and hierarchies, on the other (Crouch and Streeck 1997 Crouch Colin Streeck Wolfgang 1997 Introduction: The Future of Capitalist Diversity in Colin Crouch and Wolfgang Streeck (eds.), Political Economy of Modern Capitalism, London: Sage 1 18 [Google Scholar]: 8\u20139).

      "abstract": "Juliet Hooker's Theorizing Race in the Americas: Douglass, Sarmiento, Du Bois, and Vasconcelos (2017) is an outstanding scholarly work within contemporary political philosophy. While the book itself offers a compelling set of analyses regarding race, national and pan-national identities, and democratic theory, it is Hooker's scope, methodological innovativeness, and theoretical complexity that make the work exceptional. Hooker's analytic focus addresses political theory across several U.S. African American and Latin American contexts, and provides a novel approach to the study of four major figures within these respective fields. Namely, the book surveys the writings of Frederick Douglass, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos. More specifically, she examines how each thinker interprets race through a hemispheric lens across the Americas. For example, she analyzes how Douglass and Du Bois, in their efforts to understand and interpret their own domestic and, at times, international political concerns, each discussed Latin American models of miscegenation, immigration policy, and political mobilization strategies among Afro-descendent communities in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Similarly, the book analyzes Sarmiento's and Vasconcelos's respective conceptions of U.S. policies on abolitionism, segregation, and education, and the two theorists' considerations of these issues for Latin American forms of national cohesion and stability. As such, Theorizing Race in the Americas, both through its method and content, successfully bridges discourses of race that are rarely explored together within political theory. In what follows, I briefly frame some of the major methodological and theoretical contributions that Theorizing Race in the Americas offers to contemporary scholars interested in U.S. African American and Latin American political thought. I then examine several points for further research that Hooker's work invites from readers.The book is organized into two main sections. The first, \"Ambas Am\u00e9ricas\" (Both Americas), takes up the work of Douglass and Sarmiento, two thinkers whose writings and active political lives spanned the nineteenth century. Notably, both thinkers published their first major works in 1845. Douglass's Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave was published in Boston less than seven years after he escaped from slavery, and Sarmiento's Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism was published that same year in Santiago, Chile, while the author was living in exile from his birthplace of Argentina. Hooker notes that these thinkers are never read alongside one another, despite their immense political influence. The reasons for this, she proposes, are likely that the respective thinkers never engaged one another's work, and, given their geopolitical locations, are often considered to have very different preoccupations with respect to race (1). Douglass's political interventions focused largely on abolitionism and anti-black racism in the United States, while Sarmiento's principle interests were in securing post-independence forms of republicanism across Latin America, which included, for Sarmiento, an unambiguous form of anti-indigenous racism that he considered necessary to ensure political unity. Against this trend, Hooker situates these two thinkers in relation to one another to examine their overlapping positions vis-\u00e0-vis race, democratic theory, and the continued relevance of their respective political views.The second part of the book, titled \"Mestizo Futurisms,\" examines questions regarding political progress, racial mixing/mestizaje, and transnational networks of solidarity via the writings of Du Bois and Vasconcelos. Both Du Bois and Vasconcelos were immensely influential early- to mid-twentieth-century political figures and writers, and their respective works sought, to varying degrees, to build on the earlier efforts of their predecessors (Douglass in the case of Du Bois, and Sarmiento in the case of Vasconcelos). However, as with Sarmiento and Douglass, these two authors are rarely read in relation to one another. Again, the reasons for this are that the two are often considered to hold starkly different positions regarding race. For example, Du Bois's early writing on the continued relevance of race in \"The Conservation of Races\" (1897) is sometimes seen as evidence that he held \"a rigid, essentialist conception of race that militated against any acknowledgement of mixture\" (124). Vasconcelos's La raza c\u00f3smica (1925), on the other hand, is often considered a foundational work in Latin American theorizations of mestizaje, a view that is often interpreted as a form of racial optimism reliant upon biological and cultural mixture as a solution for problems of political unrest. Despite these commonly-held conceptions of their respective works, Hooker reads these authors in a new light, focusing on less commonly engaged texts in each authors' corpus. Hooker focuses on Du Bois's fictional writings Dark Princess (1928) and \"The Comet\" (1920), which she calls his \"mulatto fictions\" that she considers through the lens of the aesthetic and literary movement of Afro-futurism. She thus positions these works as counterevidence to views of Du Bois that consider his conception of race to be essentialist or non-dynamic. Likewise, for Vasconcelos, Hooker reads lesser known texts from his corpus such as Indolog\u00eda (1926) and Bolivarismo y Monro\u00edsmo (1934) to demonstrate the author's more radical criticisms of global white supremacy, U.S. interventionism, and anti-Latina/o racism in the United States (160).To analyze these vastly distinct thinkers and geopolitical contexts together is no easy task, and Hooker takes immense care to tie together these seemingly disparate bodies of political theory. One significant point of overlap across all four theorists, she proposes, is their \"shared albatross: scientific racism\" (5). That is, all four thinkers are immersed in philosophical and political traditions that must grapple with the tremendous outpouring of scientific writings, conferences, and debates about the relative inferiority and superiority of racial groups. Hooker thus situates Douglass and Sarmiento within a period of scientific racism spanning from 1850\u20131890 that focused primarily on questions regarding whether different racial groupings were descended from common origins (e.g. debates regarding monogenesis or polygenesis), and questions regarding the influence of climate and geography on the supposed inferiority and degeneration of nonwhite groups. For Du Bois and Vasconcelos, she argues, the racist science of eugenics spans 1890 to 1940 and influenced the writings of both thinkers. Moreover, both Du Bois and Vasconcelos, Hooker writes, \"had a shared intellectual foe in racist science, particularly the ideas of US eugenicist Madison Grant\" (9). Considerations over the ability to \"improve\" human societies by determining which racial groups were \"fit\" and \"unfit\" for continued survival and \"civilization\" were common concerns among eugenicists, including those in Grant's The Passing of the Great Race or the Racial Basis of European History (1916) (10). This shared scientific context for Du Bois and Vasconcelos provides a pivotal connection between their respective writings.Given these shared resonances, it is important to highlight the innovative methodology that Hooker employs to study both U.S. African American and Latin American political thought. Namely, she develops what she describes as a practice of \"juxtaposition,\" an approach that she contrasts with a more common form of analysis in political thought that she calls \"comparison.\" Unlike comparative methods for transnational analyses of race, juxtaposition interrogates \"the boundaries between traditions as contingent products of political power\" (13). Thus, instead of assuming that each geopolitical context is itself a fixed entity or that each thinker is solely influenced by his given national context, Hooker adopts a robustly \"historical-interpretive approach that seeks to situate the resonances and/or discontinuities between traditions of thought within the specific historical, intellectual, cultural, and socioeconomic contexts in which they emerged\" (13). Hooker also elaborates a second feature of comparative approaches that she seeks to reject as well, namely, the comparative exercise of ranking differing racial politics across distinct geopolitical contexts. In Theorizing Race in the Americas, however, rather than studying U.S. African American and Latin American political theorists alongside one another for the sake of arriving \"at an assessment of which of these two traditions has formulated the better approach to race,\" Hooker offers a method that seeks to examine how theorists from these traditions have themselves often engaged in such forms of comparative assessment (12). Thus, she interrogates how each thinker has often ended up misreading or mistakenly looking to \"the other America\" as a site of racial progress or decline (12). For example, with respect to Douglass, she examines the author's writings and editorial work that engages the political efforts of Black, indigenous, and mixed-race populations in Haiti, Santo Domingo (what is now the Dominican Republic), and in Nicaragua's Mosquito Coast. In Sarmiento's writings, she examines his correspondence with U.S. educational reformer, teacher, and abolitionist, Mary Mann, in which both interlocutors discuss their respective views on Black suffrage and the education of freed ex-slave populations (94).One additional thread that juxtaposition helps outline\u2014and a recurrent theme throughout the book\u2014is how conceptions of the possibility of stable political futures can often become based in comparative methods of analysis as well. That is, the possibility of political harmony elsewhere can provide the normative means to motivate local efforts toward social reorganization. Yet, as Hooker highlights throughout the book, the consequences of these forms of comparative ranking can often lead to political consequences that may be antithetical to contemporary decolonization efforts. U.S. interventionism, for example, can be justified on a similar comparative premise, and Hooker does not overlook Latin American concerns about U.S. imperial and economic expansionism. Specifically, her chapters on Douglass, Sarmiento, and Vasconcelos each engage extensively with problems of U.S. expansionism. A similar consequence of such forms of comparison can be found in Hooker's critical attention to discourses of racial harmony within Latin America, which often present overly generous and misleading interpretations of the rights of Afro-descendant and indigenous populations in Latin America.With this methodological framing in place, Hooker also remains attentive to questions regarding transnational solidarity among racialized populations. Her chapter on Du Bois's Afro-futurist fiction provides a compelling reinterpretation of Du Bois as a theorist embroiled in the pursuit of global anti-colonial, and antiracist revolutionary politics. The formulation of global anti-colonial and antiracist struggle in the book harkens back to Hooker's concise studies of political solidarity and collective rights for Afro-descendent and indigenous peoples in Latin America (e.g. 2008, 2009a; 2009b), and her critical approaches to mestizo nationalism, contemporary multiculturalism, and \"Latino racial exceptionalism\"1 appear to build from her earlier writings in this vein as well (e.g. 2005a; 2005b; 2014).Additionally, Hooker's analysis of black fugitivity and democratic fugitivity in Douglass's thought carefully mark the tensions between these two traditions, and she presents Douglass's contributions to democratic theory as a concerted effort toward transnational Black solidarity (29; 57). More specifically, Hooker draws from the work of Sheldon Wolin (1994), Neil Roberts (2015), and Anthony Bogues (2012) to place Douglass \"squarely within [both] the tradition of black fugitive thought\" and fugitive democratic theory (34). She thus frames the tensions between these views as a set of disagreements about the role of the state as a site for Black freedom. Fugitive democracy, she writes, \"would seek to reshape the moral dispositions of the dominant racial order, [while] black fugitivity is oriented instead to the creation of sites of black freedom that refuse of challenge the logics of coloniality and exceed or bypass the nation-state\" (39). With these tensions in mind, she reads Douglass's writings on the annexation of Santo Domingo and his political involvement in the controversy regarding the Haitian port of M\u00f4le St. Nicolas in the 1890s as evidence for his oscillation \"between the two polarities of democratic and fugitive hope\" (57). In this sense, Douglass's position on the possibility of an impermanent and contingent form of democratic freedom via the modern nation-state, and his search for sites of Black freedom that exceed the white supremacist foundations of the modern nation-state become evident through Hooker's close readings of his work.Hooker's text is thus groundbreaking in many ways, and the scope of her scholarship speaks to the immense philosophical contributions that are possible when political theorists are trained to contextually analyze differing geographic, historical, and linguistic traditions. As such, I consider Theorizing Race in the Americas a welcomed invitation to engage in further transnational studies of race. To demonstrate how the book encourages this work, I offer here a few points for further extension and critique in response to a few of Hooker's analyses offered in the book.First, one potential area of analysis offered via Hooker's chapter on Sarmiento is further investigation into the relationship between Sarmiento's writings on race and evolutionary theory. Hooker argues that the U.S. school of ethnology and Louis Agassiz, a prominent critic of evolutionary theory and of Darwin, were quite influential for Sarmiento's thinking about race, and their influence can be found in his 1883 work Conflicto y armon\u00edas de razas en Am\u00e9rica. This reading of Sarmiento also shapes the way in which Hooker situates Sarmiento's work in relation to the United States. She proposes that by 1847 the author \"turned away from Europe as his political model and looked to the United States instead\" (80). While Hooker provides a thorough analysis of the invocations of Agassiz in his writings, and suggests a decline of his interest in \"Europeanizing\" Latin America by his 1860s writings, there are several other potential avenues to explore to contextualize this period of his thinking as well. For example, one body of scholarship on Sarmiento's writings focuses specifically on his interest in Darwinian evolutionary theory. In this vein, Adriana Novoa and Alex Levine (2010) trace how Sarmiento showed great interest, like many of his contemporaries, with evolutionary theory throughout his corpus. In his 1850 Recuerdos de provincia, for instance, he appears to demonstrate a belief in the inheritance of acquired traits, a view popularized in Argentina via the writings of French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (38). Moreover, in an autobiographical work in 1886, Sarmiento writes of his early interests specifically in Darwin, stating that he bought the sixth edition of Scottish evolutionary theorist Robert Chambers's book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1847 while visiting London. Sarmiento states explicitly that this book \"prepared\" his thinking on evolution prior to Darwin's 1859 On the Origin of Species (Novoa and Levine 39). Novoa and Levine also note that, in 1868 after recently traveling to the U.S., Sarmiento writes of his familiarity with the disputes between Agassiz and Darwin, and asserts that \"Darwin's theory was Argentine\" (77), and that Sarmiento sought, in his own words, to \"nationalize it\" within the country.The significance for Sarmiento's invocations of Darwin will be most apparent to readers of Theorizing Race in the Americas who are familiar with mid- to late-nineteenth century evolutionary theory and debates about how differing views within the biological sciences impacted conceptions of race during the period. These included, for example, discussions about degeneracy, miscegenation, and educational reform. Sarmiento, as Novoa and Levine propose, attempted to \"add design to Darwin\" despite his apparent acknowledgement that such a stance on directed variation was inconsistent with Darwin's own position (77). Sarmiento also wrote in 1883 in a letter to Francisco Moreno, a prominent naturalist of the period, that \"I get along with [Herbert] Spencer. We follow the same path\" (168). Given, these references to his own thinking about Spencer and Darwin, further examinations of this period in Sarmiento's writings may be important to determine the extent to which U.S. ethnology, Agassiz, and the United States as a site for discourses on race was pivotal for Sarmiento.Another interpretive possibility may be, as Sarmiento's eulogy for Darwin in May of 1882 suggests, that Sarmiento gave preference to Darwin's evolutionary theory above Agassiz's. For example, he writes in that address, regarding Agassiz's expedition to Brazil in the 1860s in which Agassiz studied varieties of fish found in the Amazon River system, that Agassiz supposedly confesses in his writings that he found evidence that supported Darwinian evolutionary theory and monogenesis. Despite this somewhat misleading interpretation of Agassiz's work, the conclusion that Sarmiento offers is the claim that \"we who are satisfied with fewer species of fish in our rivers, let us be content, then, with the near confession of one who searched the Amazon in search of evidence with which to combat transformationist ideas and failed to find it\" (Sarmiento [1882] 2012, 137). \"Transformationism\" in this context refers, roughly, to the view that one species evolves into another, a view that Agassiz explicitly denied. Moreover, he follows this statement with the claim that further evidence against Agassiz's views can be found and supported by the work of the Argentine naturalist and Darwinist thinker, Florentino Ameghino.This point regarding Sarmiento's relationship to Darwinism, however, is not a determining factor for whether or not he maintained a fervently anti-indigenous form of racism or patronizing views of Afro-descendent peoples, as Hooker astutely discusses in the book (107). The issue here is how Sarmiento's readers ought to interpret his views regarding evolutionary theory and to what extent these views impacted his conclusions about miscegenation, racial progress/degeneracy, and education. As such, Hooker's book invites further analysis within political theory on the influence of Agassiz, Ameghino, Darwin, Spencer, and other scientists of the period within Argentine and other Latin American and U.S. debates regarding race.Additionally, Hooker's attention to the role and function of Vasconcelos's conception of mestizaje within Gloria Anzald\u00faa's Borderlands/La frontera (1987) is another provocative site of analysis in the book. Hooker states that Anzald\u00faa \"'queers' mestizaje by highlighting queer, female, Chicanas as the pre-eminent U.S. Latino subject,\" and thereby attempts \"to reimagine mestizaje in more racially egalitarian terms\" than those of Vasconcelos (189; 191). However, Hooker also argues that Anzald\u00faa was \"not able to fully escape the problematic inheritance of Vasconcelos's racial and gender politics\" because \"she did not formulate an explicit critique of the way harmonious narratives of mestizaje erased the sexual violence that was an integral part of the cultural and corporeal encounters that gave rise to the new mestizo subject\" (192). As such, she writes that this omission \"precluded her from formulating a full intersectional critique of his theory of mestizaje\" (192).From these passages, readers of Anzald\u00faa's corpus may be surprised to hear this critique in light of the numerous places throughout Borderlands/La frontera in which Anzald\u00faa addresses sexual violence during the conquest of what is today considered Mexico, and her critical analysis of the continued violation, degradation, and humiliation of women of color that has persisted since. For example, one such overlooked passage by Hooker comes near the beginning of Borderlands/La frontera wherein Anzald\u00faa describes mestizo nationalistic forms of hatred and betrayal that are attributed to La Malinche/Malinali Tenepat, the enslaved indigenous woman who was gifted to the conquistador, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Anzald\u00faa writes, Malinali Tenepat or Malintz\u00edn, has become known as la chingada\u2014the fucked one\u2026. Whore, prostitute, the woman who sold out her people to the Spaniards are epithets Chicanos spit out with contempt \u2026 The dark-skinned woman has been silenced, gagged, caged, bound into servitude with marriage, bludgeoned for 300 years, sterilized and castrated in the twentieth century. For 300 years she has been a slave, a force of cheap labor, colonized by the Spaniard, the Anglo, by her own people (and in Mesoamerica her lot under the Indian patriarchs was not free of wounding). (44\u201345) This passage comes well before Anzald\u00faa's invocation of Vasconcelos, and, as such, is an early place in Borderlands/La frontera where she explicitly discusses sexual violence against women of color. Also, in the following chapter, she describes Malinche as \"the raped mother whom we have abandoned,\" and, in \"La conciencia de la mestiza/Towards a New Consciousness,\" the chapter in which she cites Vasconcelos, she includes a section in which she explicitly condemns the numerous forms of violence that exist in \"Mexican-Indian culture,\" including a reference to sexual violence (i.e. \"they wound us, violate us\") (106). Notably, Anzald\u00faa discusses rape and the sexual violence of women of color throughout the book.2 Thus, while it is true that Anzald\u00faa does not directly critique the Vasconcelian version of mestizaje in particular, she does critique the trope of racial and sexual harmony offered via the notion of mestizaje more generally. As such, readers of Anzald\u00faa's writings may find Hooker's analysis of the thinker somewhat puzzling and potentially uncharitable. This seems even more apparent given that Hooker states explicitly in a footnote that she recognizes that she did not remain consistent with her own book's \"methodological call to read broadly beyond a thinker's most iconic texts\" in order to address Anzald\u00faa's broader body of work (245). This methodological and Hooker's of references to the immense on Anzald\u00faa's conception of mestizaje then, some readers of the book by her critique of the these potential for further analysis and Theorizing Race in the Americas many significant contributions to studies of race across African America, Latin and U.S. political of the book will be to find a of and that important debates within political and critical race theory.

In the last two decades, much research has been done on the econometric and statistical analysis of such causal effects. This recent theoretical literature has built on, and combined features of, earlier work in both the statistics and econometrics literatures. It has by now reached a level of maturity that makes it an important tool in many areas of empirical research in economics, including labor economics, public finance, development economics, industrial organization, and other areas of empirical microeconomics. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments. We focus primarily on practical issues for empirical researchers, as well as provide a historical overview of the area and give references to more technical research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Migrant women selling sex are generally neglected by migration and diaspora studies. The moral panic on 'trafficking', a prolonged debate within feminism on commercial sex and some activists' attempts to conflate the concept of 'prostitution' with 'trafficking' combine to shift study of these migrants to domains of criminology and feminism, with the result that large numbers of women's migrations are little known. This article reveals the silences at work and where the attention goes, and theorises that the shift from conventional study to moral outrage facilitates the avoidance of uncomfortable truths for Western societies: their enormous demand for sexual services and the fact that many women do not mind or prefer this occupation to others available to them. Keywords: MigrationSexProstitutionTraffickingDiaspora Notes 1. Migrants selling sex often mention that they also do domestic labour, either as a second job or as part of the first. Researchers with migrant domestic workers do not appear to ask them if they do sex work as well, rather mentioning questions of 'sexual abuse' in houses where they work. Nevertheless, some researchers acknowledge that sexual labour often forms part of the expectations of those employing domestics, though not always in print. Taboos are very strong here; though far from 'protecting' women from stigmatisation, they act to maintain the oppressive dichotomy of 'still virtuous' versus 'bad' or 'fallen' women. 2. Among those who have written about these processes are Ruggiero (1997 Ruggiero, V. 1997. 'Trafficking in human beings: slaves in contemporary Europe'.

      "abstract": "Although EU Member States share a tradition of regulating public broadcasting for the public interest, such regulation has been in decline in recent years. It has been challenged by the emergence of commercial television sworn to the market logic, as well as by satellite services and the Internet. EU law and policy has, under pressure from powerful global forces, abetted that decline. The question thus arises: Do cultural values still matter in European national broadcasting? \r\nThis important book examines the challenges posed to public service obligations by European Union media law and policy. An in-depth analysis of the extent to which six countries (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) regulate broadcasting for the public interest reveals a range of vulnerability to national political pressures or, alternatively, to the ideology of market sovereignty. The author examines the country of origin principle and the European quota rule of the Television without Frontiers Directive, revealing the influence of European law on the definition and enforcement of programme requirements, and shows how the case law of the European Court of Justice encourages deregulation at the national level without offering adequate safeguards at the supranational level in exchange. She asks the question whether the alleged \u2018European audiovisual model\u2019 actually persists\u2014that is, whether broadcasting is still committed to protecting such values as cultural diversity, the safety of minors, the susceptibility of consumers to advertising, media pluralism, and the fight against racial and religious hatred. The book concludes with an evaluation of the impact of the EU state aid regime on the licence fee based financing of public broadcasting. \r\nDespite the increasing importance of the subject, its study in a comparative context has been heretofore underdeveloped. This book fully provides that context and more, and will be of great value and interest to all parties concerned with the key role of communications in the development of European integration.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract It is widely recognized that our understanding of the racial order will remain forever unsatisfactory so long as we fail to turn our analytic gaze back upon ourselves, the analysts of racial domination, and inquire critically into the hidden presuppositions that shape our thought. However, for reflexivity to be employed widely in the interest of scientific truth, analysts must acknowledge that reflexive thinking entails much more than observing how one's social position (racial identity or class background, for example) affects one's scientific analyses. In this paper, we deepen the meaning of scholarly reflexivity, discussing how it can be directed at three levels of hidden presuppositions: the social, the disciplinary, and the scholastic. Keywords: RacereflexivityBourdieuwhitenessrace theoryphilosophy of science Notes 1. Whether or not Durkheim satisfactorily followed his own guidelines is a different matter. Certainly, he failed to scrutinize how the anthropology of 'primitive societies', a tradition of research on which he relied heavily in Elementary Forms (1995 [1912]), was (mis)informed by its colonial project and by white supremacist modes of classification. Like other thinkers of the classical generation, he championed the benefits of reflexive thought while remaining less than unambiguously reflexive when it came to matters of racial inequality and cultural difference. 2. Durkheim insisted that the starting point of scientific inquiry must be a rigorous delineation of the problem at hand, rather than an uncritical acceptance of definitions already provided by folk wisdom or academic culture. To this end, we present herewith our own definition of 'race': race is a symbolic category, based on phenotype or ancestry and constructed according to specific social and historical contexts, that is misrecognized as a natural category. We have unpacked this definition elsewhere (Desmond and Emirbayer 2009 Desmond, Matthew and Emirbayer, Mustafa. 2009. What is racial domination?. The Du Bois Review, 6: 335\u201355. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 3. We do not contend that the influence of one's racial identity on one's thinking somehow requires more vigilance than the influence of, say, one's family background or sexuality. In fact, the widespread habit of applying reflexivity narrowly to the 'holy trinity' of race, class, and gender is a limiting practice itself in need of reflexive consideration. Can it be doubted that, for some intellectual pursuits, religion (or religious aversion to religion), cosmopolitanism (or lack thereof), age, or politics hold considerably more sway than racial identity, gender, or class? If we have chosen here to apply our ideas about reflexivity exclusively to race scholarship, it is because, first, many recent contributions to reflexivity have been advanced by race scholars and, second, we see in this area of study a particularly pressing need to reconsider the most basic imperatives of reflexivity, given the eclipse of identity politics in scholarly writing (if not in the political sphere). 4. Of course, as philosophers of race (e.g., Appiah 1990, 2006; Shelby 2005 Shelby, Tommie. 2005. We Who Are Dark: The Philosophical Foundations of Black Solidarity, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) have observed, the putatively simple act of identifying one's location, of knowing 'who one is', is in actuality often exceedingly complex, contentious, and unceasing. 5. Although the ensuing paragraphs focus on white privilege in American scholarship about race, the ideas presented therein can be generalized to other national and intellectual contexts. 6. For reflexive critiques of how racialized presuppositions have influenced modern philosophy, see Goldberg (1993 Goldberg, David Theo. 1993. Racist Culture: Philosophy and the Politics of Meaning, Malden: Blackwell Publishers. [Google Scholar]) and Mills (1999 Mills, Charles. 1999. The Racial Contract, Ithaca, NJ: Cornell University Press. [Google Scholar]). 7. Additionally, social-scientific questions and intellectual interests often are influenced by forces beyond the scientific field, especially those emanating from the political field. In some instances, questions follow the money, as lines of inquiry \u2013 even entire subfields \u2013 are built up or abandoned in accordance with federal funding priorities. (Thus, Haveman [1987] shows how grants distributed after the War on Poverty helped to create and legitimatize the field of poverty research.) In other cases, scientific questions are molded by the zeitgeist of the times. Gould (1996, p. 28) has demonstrated as much in observing that '[r]esurgences of biological determinism correlate with periods of political retrenchment and destruction of social generosity.' 8. One white scholar reflects on his earlier work this way: '[W]hile many scholars of color have valued this article, and while I continue to think it is a valuable contribution, at the same time, I now consider it an example of white racism. By myself \u2013 as a white scholar \u2013 I assumed that I could represent well the racial \"other.\" Given the deadly history of the representation of people of color by white scholars and given the fact that I too continue to embody white racism, acting alone as a white scholar like this is much too dangerous' (Scheurich 2002, p. 17). 9. The 'insider doctrine' is also (at least indirectly) responsible for the rise of whiteness studies. The doctrine became so established with the rise of 'identity politics' that white analysts who wished to study race and ethnicity felt they had to emulate their nonwhite peers by 'studying their own community.' (In many cases, they were instructed to do so in so many words by nonwhite thinkers.) Because the insider doctrine permits one to speak on behalf of a group only on condition that one actually belongs to that group, white scholars were forced to establish whites as a legitimate racial group that could be analysed. This is part of the reason why virtually all whiteness scholars are themselves white. 10. Recent examples include Bonilla-Silva (1999 Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. 1999. The essential fact of race.

[Google Scholar]; see also Winant 2000); and ethnomethodology (Moerman 1974 Moerman, Michael. 1974. \"Accomplishing ethnicity\". In Ethnomethodology: Selected Readings, Edited by: Turner, Roy. 54\u201368. Baltimore, MD: Penguin Education. [Google Scholar]). 12. Of course, if the point of this discussion is to warn against false universalization, then one also must bear in mind the danger that, in highlighting it, Bourdieu himself falsely universalizes what is, in fact, a privileged condition enjoyed only by a few. Even in the US, many academics do not produce under circumstances of leisure; for instance, critical race theory was in considerable part the creation of legal scholars of colour whose everyday racial realities stood in sharp tension with the exigencies of their professional and academic lives. Bourdieu's ideas about skhol\u00e8 thus tell us more, arguably, about his own situation \u2013 and that of other (white) elites in the academy \u2013 than, as a true descriptive statement, about the conditions of work of many knowledge producers. However, it might also be pointed out that many of the knowledge producers whose ideas have most deeply influenced and shaped race scholarship \u2013 and hence have come under our purview \u2013 do work (and have worked) in scholastic contexts precisely of the sort described by Bourdieu. 13. On the other side of the ledger, authors such as Hays (2003 Hays, Sharon. 2003. Flat Broke with Children: Women in the Age of Welfare Reform, New York: Oxford University Press. [Google Scholar]) and Edin and Kefalas (2005 Edin, Kathryn and Kefalas, Maria. 2005. Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood before Marriage, Berkeley: University of California Press. [Google Scholar]) have sought to think through the political implications of different ways of portraying disadvantaged actors, stressing how these approaches have shaped their academic writing. 14. According to Gutmann (1996 Gutmann, Amy. 1996. \"Must public policy be color blind?\". In Color Conscious: The Political Morality of Race, Edited by: Anthony Appiah, K. and Gutmann, Amy. 108\u201317. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. [Google Scholar]), colour-blindness is pervasive in American thought not because it is a just response to racial injustice but because it is 'the ideal morality for an ideal society.' Through an abracadabric act that transforms ethics into ontology (a way to live into how life is), colour-blindness demands an instant good society, one without history, where things are right and nothing is in need of restoration (see Desmond and Emirbayer 2011). 15. In a later work, Glazer (1997 Glazer, Nathan. 1997. We Are All Multiculturalists Now, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. [Google Scholar]) partially renounced his earlier views on affirmative action. 16. Several thinkers have harvested the low-hanging fruit of decrying racial classification; sorely needed, however, are rigorous empirical investigations of the genesis, development, and dynamics of racial taxonomies, investigations such as Jung's (2003 Jung, Moon-Kie. 2003. Interracialism: the ideological transformation of Hawaii's working class. American Sociological Review, 68: 373\u2013400. [Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae] , [Google Scholar]) review of Hawaii's shifting racial boundaries or Brubaker et al.'s (2006 Brubaker, Rogers. 2006. Nationalist Politics and Everyday Ethnicity in a Transylvanian Town, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) analysis of 'everyday ethnicity' in Transylvania. 17. Of course, oftentimes members of disadvantaged groups hesitate to draw attention to internecine problems, not out of a kind of ethnic chauvinism or adulation, but because they are aware that doing so may result in a wide array of consequences: the group may be denigrated by members of dominant groups; the documentation of internecine problems may be employed as evidence of harmful public policies (e.g., harsher sentencing); and initiatives designed to alleviate the problems may have the opposite effect (see Crenshaw 1991 Crenshaw, Kimberle. 1991. Mapping the margins: intersectionality, identity, and violence against women of color. Stanford law Review, 43: 1241\u201399. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 18. We use these categories in a slightly different way here than above, where they were deployed to discuss the three distinctive forms of the scholastic fallacy. Here, they summarize some of the key implications of our analysis as a whole. 19. Others (Shelby 2002 Shelby, Tommie. 2002. Is racism in the \"heart\"?. Journal of Social Philosophy, 33: 411\u201320. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]; Blum 2007 Blum, Lawrence. 2007. \"Racial virtues\". In Working Virtue: Virtue Ethnics and Contemporary Moral Problems, Edited by: Walker, Rebecca and Ivanhoe, Philip. 225\u201349. Oxford: Clarendon Press. [Google Scholar]) have pointed out the philosophic shortcomings of viewing racism as an individual moral vice, as a matter 'of the heart' (e.g., Garcia 1996 Garcia , J.L.A. 1996 \" The Heart of Racism ,\" Journal of Social Philosophy , vol. 27 , pp. 5 \u2013 45 [Crossref], [PubMed] , [Google Scholar]). 20. Thus, it is a mistake to conceive of reflexivity as a kind of sudden conversion experience. Rather, it is best understood as a sustained process \u2013 and a thoroughly collective one at that. Similarly, it is erroneous to divide (in legalistic fashion) social scientists into two camps \u2013 the 'reflexive' and the 'unreflexive' \u2013 just as it is erroneous to separate the general population into 'racists' and 'non-racists' (see Wacquant 1997 Wacquant, Lo\u00efc. 1997. For an analytic of racial domination. Political Power and Social Theory, 11: 221\u201334. [Google Scholar]).",

Phenomenology is a form of qualitative research that focuses on the study of an individual\u2019s lived experiences within the world. Although it is a powerful approach for inquiry, the nature of this methodology is often intimidating to HPE researchers. This article aims to explain phenomenology by reviewing the key philosophical and methodological differences between two of the major approaches to phenomenology: transcendental and hermeneutic. Understanding the ontological and epistemological assumptions underpinning these approaches is essential for successfully conducting phenomenological research. Purpose This review provides an introduction to phenomenology and demonstrates how it can be applied to HPE research. We illustrate the two main sub-types of phenomenology and detail their ontological, epistemological, and methodological differences. Conclusions Phenomenology is a powerful research strategy that is well suited for exploring challenging problems in HPE. By building a better understanding of the nature of phenomenology and working to ensure proper alignment between the specific research question and the researcher\u2019s underlying philosophy, we hope to encourage HPE scholars to consider its utility when addressing their research questions.",

      "authors": [],
      "publication_year": 2010,
      "publication_date": "2010-01-21",
      "abstract": "After investigating these cases from around the world, through the theoretical frameworks of place and process, can we now answer the question that \nwas posed as the title of this book, and identify to whom public spaces \nbelong? The complexity of the urban design, development and management \nprocesses in these cases, and of the configuration of urban societies in which \nthey are located, makes it impossible to find simple answers. But across the \ncases, we are able to identify a recurring theme whereby individuals, social \ngroups and organizations make or withdraw claims over space, thereby \nimplicitly or explicitly contesting the claim of others, instigating a process \nof inclusion and exclusion, creating spaces with overlapping meanings. We \ncan see how public spaces are significant for all urban societies, no matter \nwhat the size of the city, its economic basis or its political and cultural configurations. Public spaces, as significant material and social components of \ncities, are therefore subject to intense processes of social interaction through \nwhich their quality and character are determined.\n Claims could be made by powerful individuals and institutions, \nsuch as a supermarket chain or a shopping mall in England, a local authority in France, a local prince in Nigeria, or housing designers and developers \nin Saudi Arabia and Iran. Claims could also be made by individuals or \ninformal groups of people who try to shape the space, such as youth subcultures in the United Kingdom, public housing residents in the Netherlands, \nstreet drinkers in Germany, low-income households in Mexico, local businessmen in Taiwan, or middle-class South Africans, each with widely different views and outcomes. Depending on their level of political, economic and \ncultural power and influence, these individuals and organizations can shape \nand determine some of the features of the urban space, creating the structural conditions within which others live and use the city. Their resources \nallow the more powerful individuals and institutions to make substantial \nphysical and institutional changes in cities, while the claims by the less \npowerful groups may take softer, temporary forms. Each individual, group \nor organization may try to shape the city in their own image, creatingspaces that would enable them to feel safe and in control, with or without \nconsideration of what others may need. Public spaces, even in their most \npublic forms, therefore, tend to find particular flavours, a different character associated with particular combination of groups and interests, under \npressure to find a fixed identity within a particular fragment of society.\n Public spaces are shaped not only by claims, but also by the \nabsence of claims, by withdrawal from the public sphere. Withdrawal from \npublic space may be due to a fear of crime, mistrust of other social groups, \nand intensified social polarization. This withdrawal is reflected in neglect \nand decline, poor maintenance, accumulation of waste and refuse, or lack \nof care and attention. Neglect of public spaces may be a result of exaggerated preferences for vehicular movement, which was the dominant theme in \nshaping cities for much of the industrial era. Such neglect may also reflect \nthe absence of local governance \u2013 that is, coordinating mechanisms to facilitate negotiation between different claims over space. Public spaces provide \nlinkages between private spheres, and represent the character and quality of \na city as a whole. The decline of public space reflects a breakdown in social \nand spatial linkages and a deterioration of the city as a whole.\n The case studies presented in this book map out the changing \nnature of public space. Public open spaces are changing from being embedded in the social fabric of the city to being a part of more impersonal and \nfragmented urban environments. The various chapters show how public \nspaces are changing alongside the changing nature of cities and urban societies: from places embedded in particular communal traditions and routines \nto impersonal spaces produced by economic, political, technical and management considerations \u2013 in other words, they are undergoing a transition \nfrom an expressive to an instrumental character. Public spaces that once \nwere meaningful places are becoming a mere part of a transportation network dominated by cars. They are also at risk of being taken over by \nminority interests, being privatized in the name of safety or exclusivity, further fragmenting the urban society and space.\n The particular characters of public spaces may be instrumental or \nexpressive. As instrumental spaces, they are used as a means to an end, such as \nthe development of a public bus station, or the pedestrianization of a street for \nthe purpose of gaining commercial profit for businesses, or the gating of streets \nfor the perceived safety of resident groups. Instrumental use can also be made \nfor an essential need, such as the public spaces in low-income neighbourhoods \nin Mexico or small towns in France, where the quality of urban life is closely \nconnected with the process of urban development and the provision of public \nspaces. As expressive spaces, they may be used to project and explore identity, \nsuch as the gathering of youth subcultures or international migrants in a European city, or a festival space in a traditional African city. The inclusive and \nparticipatory development of a common good such as public spaces can help \ncombine instrumental and expressive concerns, creating places that people use \nand can identify with, while reinvigorating society through collective action.",

A growing body of scholarship suggests potential benefits of these activities, including opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, development of skills useful in the modern workplace, and a more empowered conception of citizenship. Some argue that young people pick up these key skills and competencies on their own by interacting with popular culture; but the problems of unequal access, lack of media transparency, and the breakdown of traditional forms of socialization and professional training suggest a role for policy and pedagogical intervention.This report aims to shift the conversation about the \"digital divide\" from questions about access to technology to questions about access to opportunities for involvement in participatory culture and how to provide all young people with the chance to develop the cultural competencies and social skills needed. Fostering these skills, the authors argue, requires a systemic approach to media education; schools, afterschool programs, and parents all have distinctive roles to play.The John D. and Catherine T.

The perceived limit to producing food for a growing global population remains a source of debate and preoccupation despite the agriculture sector's historical ability to meet such demand. This paper is the latest in the series by the Global Perspective Studies unit within FAO, which aims to provide insights into how food and agriculture may develop, between now and 2050, making note of key assumptions and uncertainties.

      "abstract": "Abstract Findings presented here about farmer suicides in Amravati and Yavatmal districts, Maharashtra, are evaluated in relation to Durkheimian theory, which attributes such acts to an historically specific combination of social and economic causes. Lower and middle caste peasant smallholders found themselves trapped between enhanced aspirations generated by land reform and other post-1947 measures, and the reality of neoliberalism (rising debt, declining income). Suicides among large and medium farmers belonging to the higher castes in Maharashtra were occasioned by failures in business, trade and politics. Such cases are consistent with the argument put forward by Durkheim, that suicide is an effect of individualization, a process of socio-economic \u2018estrangement\u2019 from agrarian communities experienced by rural producers in the context of rapid economic growth. Notes Two surveys carried out in Maharashtra (one jointly by the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini, Mumbai and Indian Agro-Economic Research Centre, New Delhi, and the other by Dash et al. [1998 Dash AP et al. 1998 Failure of Cotton Crop and Its Impact on Farmers Pune: Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management [Google Scholar]], also highlight crop loss and indebtedness as the main causal factors in farmer suicides. Hence the view [ Durkheim, 1952 Durkheim Emile 1952 Suicide: A Study in Sociology London: Routledge & Kegan Paul [Google Scholar]: 245] that \u2018\u2026 economic distress does not have the aggravating influence often attributed to it, \u2026 it tends rather to produce the opposite effect. There is very little suicide in Ireland, where the peasantry leads to wretched a life. Poverty-stricken Calabria has almost no suicides; Spain has a tenth as many as France. Poverty may even be considered a protection\u2019. This view has been very influential on all subsequent studies [ Miley, 1972 Miley, James D. 1972. Structural Change and the Durkheimian Legacy: A Macro-social Analysis of Suicide Rates. American Journal of Sociology, Vol.78, No.3 [Google Scholar]]. This of course is the subject of much debate. For a discussion of Durkheim's objections to psychologistic reductionism where explanations of suicide are concerned, see MacIntyre [1971 MacIntyre Alasdair 1971 Against the Self-Images of the Age: Essays on Ideology and Philosophy London: Gerald Duckworth [Google Scholar]: 222ff.]. Farmer suicides are regularly reported in these districts. In 1999, they accounted for over 50 per cent of the total farmer suicides in the state, and by 2002 the figure had risen to 57 per cent. For details, see Mohanty [2001 Mohanty, BB. 2001a. Suicides of Farmers in Maharashtra: A Socio-economic Analysis. Review of Development and Change, Vol.6, No.2 [Google Scholar]a] and Mohanty and Shroff [2003 Mohanty BB Shroff Sangeeta 2003 Market Imperfections and Farmers' Distress in Maharashtra Pune: Gokhale Institute of Economics and Politics [Google Scholar]]. An example is the concept of the \u2018suicide bomber\u2019, as deployed by the Japanese during the 1939\u201345 war, and by the Palestinians (and others) currently in the Middle East. It is a truism that largescale conflict between nations has a profound impact on the meaning not only of death but also of suicide. The latter is not used to classify soldiers in battle obeying military commands that they know will result in their death, as happened in the case of soldiers \u2018going over the top\u2019 in the trenches during the 1914\u201318 war. Even where this possibility is acknowledged, however, the act of suicide is invariably recast as one of self-sacrifice, in the process shifting the meaning from a negative to a positive one. This is true of most warfare. Examples would include Ireland and Spain. It is important, however, to note a methodological caveat in this connection. Because in such contexts suicide is stigmatized, its true incidence remains hidden. Hence the observation by Brody [1973 Brody Hugh 1973 Inishkillane: Change and Decline in the West of Ireland London: Allen Lane, the Penguin Press [Google Scholar]: 100] in his classic study of rural Ireland: \u2018Suicides, though carefully concealed in a Roman Catholic society wherever possible, are not rare\u2019. On dowry death in India, see among others Kumari [1989 Kumari Ranjana 1989 Brides Are Not for Burning: Dowry Victims in India New Delhi: Radiant Publishers [Google Scholar]]. When considering the incidence of suicide in relation to women, Durkheim [1933 Durkheim Emile 1933 The Division of Labour in Society (translated by George Simpson), New York: Macmillan [Google Scholar]: 247] manages to invoke all the usual prelapsarian gender stereotypes. Females are less prone to suicide because, in his opinion, \u2018[w]oman has had less part than man in the movement of civilization\u2026 She recalls, moreover, certain characteristics of primitive natures.\u2019 As Lockwood [1982 Lockwood David 1982 Fatalism: Durkheim's Hidden Theory of Order in Anthony Giddens and Gavin Mackenzie (eds.), Social Class and the Division of Labour: Essays in Honour of Ilya Neustadt, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press [Google Scholar]] has pointed out, Durkheim's conservative vision of society is underwritten by a concept of \u2018fatalism\u2019, a term which ascribes to its subject an inability to change his/her surroundings. This, as Lockwood also notes, is particularly true of his conceptualization of \u2018suicide\u2019, with its inference about wholesale resignation to the status quo, either in pre-industrial or indeed industrial contexts. This is ironic, since it is also possible to interpret self-inflicted death as the opposite kind of phenomenon: that is to say, as an act of resistance, or agency designed to change the status quo. The latter is a view which structures analyses of the slaves in plantation societies. An illustration of this kind of interpretation is the case-study outlined by Malinowski [1926 Malinowski Bronislaw 1926 Crime and Custom in Savage Society New York: Harcourt Brace [Google Scholar]: 77\u201379] of a suicide in the Trobriands as a result of breaking the tribal rules of exogamy. Malinowski [1926 Malinowski Bronislaw 1926 Crime and Custom in Savage Society New York: Harcourt Brace [Google Scholar]: 80] qualified the Durkheimian approach by pointing out that it was only when scandal occurred that suicide resulted. In terms of causality, therefore, it was not so much the breaking of clan totemic exogamy as it becoming a topic of gossip that led to ostracism and eventually suicide. Where social wants exceed the possible means for attaining them, the subject is confronted with a perpetual gap between aspirations and achievements. If the ends of action are contradictory, inaccessible or insignificant, a condition of anomie arises [ Powell, 1958 Powell, Elwin H. 1958. Occupation, Status and Suicide: Toward a Redefinition of Anomie. American Sociological Review, Vol.23, No.2 [Google Scholar]]. Durkheim [1952 Durkheim Emile 1952 Suicide: A Study in Sociology London: Routledge & Kegan Paul [Google Scholar]: 259] also discussed the crises of widowhood and divorce as also their debilitating effects on the subject. These are among the domestic reasons giving rise to anomic suicides. The theoretical connection between Durkheim's views about suicide and his work on the social division of labour have been noted by many previous writers, including Giddens [1971 Giddens A 1971 Capitalism and Modern Social Theory: An Analysis of the Writings of Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber Cambridge: Cambridge University Press [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]]. None, however, have placed his analysis of suicide in the wider context of agrarian transition, and linked it to his concerns about the impact of economic development in general \u2013 and that structured by a laissez-faire philosophy in particular \u2013 on rural communities. As is clear from Besnard [1983 Besnard Philippe (ed.) 1983 The Sociological Domain: The Durkheimians and the Founding of French Sociology Cambridge: Cambridge University Press [Google Scholar]], in France the leading Durkheimians \u2013 such as Mauss, L\u00e9vy-Bruhl and Bougl\u00e9 \u2013 were anthropologists, or scholars whose theoretical concerns were precisely the \u2018otherness\u2019 of pre-industrial societies. This key theoretical linkage is found in Book Two, Chapter 1, Pt. 2 of The Division of Labour (entitled \u2018The Progress of the Division of Labour and of Happiness\u2019). There, for example, one encounters the following explicit claim [ Durkheim, 1933 Durkheim Emile 1933 The Division of Labour in Society (translated by George Simpson), New York: Macmillan [Google Scholar]: 247]: \u2018In the interior of each [European] country, one observes the same relation. Everywhere suicide rages more fiercely in the cities than in the country. Civilization is concentrated in the great cities, suicide likewise\u2026 The classes of population furnish suicide a quota proportionate to their degree of civilization.\u2019 Significantly, a target of the critique contained in The Division of Labour was Herbert Spencer, an enthusiastic advocate of laissez-faire economic policy [ Durkheim, 1933 Durkheim Emile 1933 The Division of Labour in Society (translated by George Simpson), New York: Macmillan [Google Scholar]: 200ff.]. It is important to note that this attack came not from the political left but rather from the political right. What is often forgotten, therefore, is that there is a strong anti-capitalist tradition among conservatives, who decry the destruction of \u2018natural\u2019 rural communities. Like many conservatives, Durkheim objected to the erosion of \u2018primitive\u2019 society \u2013 the repository of virtue \u2013 by untrammelled market forces. Rural society was based on a rigid caste structure, the main cultivators being the Kunbis, Malis and Baris [ Government of British India, 1911 Government of British India 1911 Central Provinces District Gazetteers \u2013 Amraoti District Volume A. Descriptive (edited by S.V. Fitzgerald and A.E. Nelson), Bombay: Caxton Works [Google Scholar]:180\u201381]. Agricultural production was mostly for local needs, the area under cultivation being adjusted to meet the requirements of a changing local population. Since peasant cultivators were not only undifferentiated economically but also prohibited from accumulating wealth, the major form of surplus extraction they faced was the land revenue demand [ Government of British India, 1910 Government of British India 1910 Central Provinces District Gazetteers \u2013 Akola District Volume A. Descriptive (by C. Brown), Calcutta: Baptist Mission Press [Google Scholar]: 192]. The occupational distribution of selected castes is contained in the 1931 Census of India [ Government of British India, 1933 Government of British India 1933 Census of India, Volume XII: Central Provinces and Berar, Part I \u2013 Report by W.H. Shoobert Nagpur: Superintendent of Census Operations [Google Scholar]: 265\u201369]. Significantly, improvements in productivity did not attract extra revenue demands. Nagpur Settlement Record, as cited in Government of British India [1911 Government of British India 1911 Central Provinces District Gazetteers \u2013 Amraoti District Volume A. Descriptive (edited by S.V. Fitzgerald and A.E. Nelson), Bombay: Caxton Works [Google Scholar]: 131]. About Kunbi landownership, a Marathi proverb [ Russell, 1916 Russell RV 1916 The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India (Vol.IV), London: Macmillan [Google Scholar]:49] observes that: \u2018Wherever it thunders, there the Kunbi is a landholder and tens of millions are dependent on the Kunbi but the Kunbi depends on no man\u2019. The percentage distribution of different Castes in the population of Amravati and Yavatmal districts according to the 1911 Census is set out below: As long-stapled American cotton was preferred to short-stapled Indian cotton for use in Britain [ Benjamin, 1973 Benjamin, N. 1973.

Suicides of Farmers in Maharashtra: A Socio-economic Analysis. Review of Development and Change, Vol.6, No.2 [Google Scholar]a: 153]. The retail prices of jowar, wheat, paddy, cotton and gram from 1891\u201392 to 1925\u201326 broadly indicate a rising trend. The monthly wages of agricultural labourers were almost constant from 1891\u201392 to 1902\u201303, but lower during the famine years. For details, see Government of British India [1926a; 1926b]. To encourage the cultivation of cotton and other cash crops, the Colonial State advanced loans to substantial proprietors under the Land Improvement Act and the Agriculturists Loans Act, even in periods when harvests were poor [Government of British India, 1927 Government of British India 1927a Central Provinces District Gazetteers \u2013 Amraoti District (Statistical Tables 1891\u20131926) Nagpur: Government Press [Google Scholar]a; 1927 Government of British India 1927b Central Provinces District Gazetteers \u2013 Yeotmal District (Statistical Tables 1891\u20131926) Nagpur: Government Press [Google Scholar]b]. Such credit facilities were of course not available to landless labourers.

Thus, for example, the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act (1950) abolished all the proprietary rights in estates, mahals and alienated lands, while the 1961 Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act prescribed an upper limit to the amount of land owned. The Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Vidarbha Region and Kutch Area Act (1958) provided for the transfer of leased land into the ownership of the tenant. Other measures included the consolidation of holdings and the distribution of land to scheduled castes and tribes. Up to 1995, ceiling surplus land amounting to 10,751 holdings consisting of 15,963 hectares in Amaravati and 4,635 holdings of 8,178 hectares in Yavatmal were distributed to landless families of various categories [ Rajasekaran, 1996 Rajasekaran N 1996 Trends in Operational Holding in Maharashtra: An Analysis of Determinants Pune: Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics [Google Scholar]]. A total of 4,018 holdings covering an area of 5,728 hectares were distributed to the scheduled castes in Amaravati, the corresponding figures for Yavatmal being 1,302 holdings with an area of 2,337 hectares. Census data indicate that scheduled caste cultivators in relation to workers in rural Amaravati rose from 11 per cent in 1971 to 14 in 1981 [ Government of India, 1975 Government of India 1975 Census of India 1971: Series- ii Maharashtra Part II-C(i), Social and Cultural Tables Mumbai: Directorate of Census Operations [Google Scholar]: 92; 1983a: 158]. Although the 1991 Census suggests there was an apparent decline in the overall proportion of scheduled caste cultivators [ Government of India, 1993 Government of India 1993 Census of India 1991: Series-14 Maharashtra Part II-B(ii) Primary Census Abstract, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Mumbai: Directorate of Census Operations [Google Scholar]: 442], this was due to the inclusion of Nav-Buddhists in this group [ Government of India, 1993 Government of India 1993 Census of India 1991: Series-14 Maharashtra Part II-B(ii) Primary Census Abstract, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Mumbai: Directorate of Census Operations [Google Scholar]: 1213\u20131215]. The proportion of scheduled caste cultivators in Yavatmal increased from 8 per cent in 1971 to 14 per cent in 1981 and 17 per cent in 1991 [ Government of India, 1975 Government of India 1975 Census of India 1971: Series- ii Maharashtra Part II-C(i), Social and Cultural Tables Mumbai: Directorate of Census Operations [Google Scholar]: 92; 1983a: 160; 1993: 458]. Data from the Department of Agriculture in the Government of Maharashtra [various issues] covering the period 1980\u201381 to 1997\u201398 show that in both districts the area under HYVs increased over the years, to more than 90 per cent in the case of crops like wheat, bajra, jowar and cotton. The per hectare cost of cotton cultivation in Maharashtra increased from Rs. 2,1444 in 1981\u201382 to Rs. 6,341 in 1995\u201396 in real terms [ Government of India, 1991 Government of India 1991 Cost of Cultivation of Principal Crops in India New Delhi: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation [Google Scholar]:127 and 1998: 279]. Similarly, the cost of cultivation of jowar rose from just Rs.716 in 1981\u201382 to Rs. 2,119 in 1995\u201396 [ Government of India, 1986 Government of India 1986 Reports of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on Price Policy for the Crops Sown in 1985\u201386 Season New Delhi: Department of Agriculture and Cooperation [Google Scholar]: 70; 1998: 282]. There are also licensed moneylenders who advance loans under the provision of the Bombay Moneylenders Act (1946). Though their number has decreased owing to the expansion of formal credit network, the amount of loans advanced by them has increased over the years [Mohanty, 2001 Mohanty, BB. 2001a. Suicides of Farmers in Maharashtra: A Socio-economic Analysis. Review of Development and Change, Vol.6, No.2 [Google Scholar]a]. The expanding importance of agricultural co-operative societies is evident from the information presented below: Annual crop reports issued by the Government of Maharashtra [Various Issues] indicated that from 1970\u201371 to 1998\u20131999 harvest prices for all the major crops grown in the two districts have increased sharply throughout this period. The monopoly procurement scheme for cotton was introduced in Maharashtra during 1972, since when the price of cotton has gradually increased. Estimates for the agricultural season 2000\u20132001 indicate that in Amravati district the irrigated area was only eight per cent of the sown area, the corresponding figure for Yavatmal district being six per cent. In the entire period from 1970\u201371 to 2000\u20132001 most of the major crops were cultivated almost without recourse to irrigation. In 1997\u201398, for example, financial losses due to crop failure amounted to Rs. 324 million in Amravati and Rs. 16 million in Yavatmal [Mohanty, 2001 Mohanty, BB. 2001a.

A list containing 72 cases of farmer suicides was obtained from the Agriculture Department, Government of Maharashtra. Village level fieldwork revealed that four of these cases involved landless labourers, and a further two cases could not be investigated because of insufficient details.

      "abstract": "Discussions of demagoguery are, unfortunately, back in vogue in popular political discourse. Within the contemporary political landscape, the question of whether various world leaders should be considered demagogues abounds. In the American context, many perceive strong demagogic tendencies in President Donald Trump, and others see it in candidates like Bernie Sanders. This assessment, while perhaps not always stated in such specific terms, is prevalent throughout much of the rhetoric in public debate and deliberation, with Democrats and Republicans demonizing each other with more frequency. While this discussion seems particularly relevant to the contemporary political climate, demagoguery as a term dates all the way back to some of the earliest political philosophers of the Western tradition. The term's origin was decidedly neutral, as can be seen in the likes of Aristophanes and Thucydides. Donald Trump is, in the most neutral sense of the term, a demagogue. That is to say that Trump is a leader of a group of people, a fact that his 2016 election victory affirms. Trump may also be a demagogue in the more charged sense of the word. This more charged definition finds its roots in Plato and Aristotle, who began to complicate the term before Plutarch defined the term with a negative valence that has stuck. A critical aspect of defining demagoguery in the contemporary lexicon is a focus on how an individual's rhetorical moves, with unique personal motivations, drive a public toward us versus them binaries. Much of the scholarship on the Nazis and Adolf Hitler is an exemplar of this obsession with individualistic demagoguery, as it often elucidates personal motives for Hitler's demagogic rhetoric toward the Jews. Since Hitler is considered by many to be the demagogue par excellence and some of this understanding can be traced to Kenneth Burke, this conception of demagoguery as something enacted by a particular speaker has remained dominant in rhetorical study and political philosophy.Against such a backdrop, Patricia Roberts-Miller's Rhetoric and Demagoguery provides a timely intervention into how we define and think about demagoguery. In order to accomplish such a task, Roberts-Miller traces the way demagoguery is currently envisioned, explains the deficits of that conceptualization, provides a new working definition grounded in argumentation theory, and then uses a series of examples to support her argument. Roberts-Miller takes issue with defining demagoguery as the intentional use of scapegoating by a liberal autonomous subject. For many scholars, it is easier to explain rampant discrimination, fascism, and violence as something spurred by an individual speaker rather than addressing what allowed that message to take root.Roberts-Miller therefore criticizes this approach and provides a redefinition of demagoguery as \u201ca polarizing discourse that promises stability, certainty, and escape from the responsibilities of rhetoric through framing public policy in terms of the degree to which and means by which (not whether) the out-group should be punished and scapegoated for the current problems of the in-group\u201d (16). Further, she contends that public policy debate in a demagogic society tends to focus on only three things: group identity, need, and severity of punishment against the out-group. To elucidate the features that flow from this definition, Roberts-Miller draws on Cha\u00efm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca's concept of philosophical paired terms. This terminology, which she rephrases as binary paired terms, shows how societal demagoguery relies on binaries, which usually circle back to in-group versus out-group driven decision making. This allows rhetors to skip deliberation and sound argumentation and simply assert their position. Roberts-Miller further theorizes how these dynamics mean that political debate focuses on nonfalsifiable motivism rather than specific policy proposals. Roberts-Miller accomplishes much of this method and theory building in the introductory and concluding chapters, advancing specific case studies in the body chapters that help elucidate and nuance her redefinition.The first example Roberts-Miller turns to is the invasion of Iraq, explored in depth in chapter 1. Roberts-Miller explains that what made her write this book was the almost entirely absent policy debate prior to the invasion of Iraq. Roberts-Miller argues that policy debate must address both need and a plan. To be clear, there was plenty of ideological pseudo-debate about need in the lead-up to the invasion, but Roberts-Miller points out there was hardly any concrete policy discussion about what plans might be considered. Beginning with the necessary background information on the lead-up to this war, Roberts-Miller then pivots to an explanation of how identity was substituted for policy. President George W. Bush and his administration did all they could to avoid discussion of a particular plan for Iraq. Such deliberation, in their view, would have delayed and bogged down support for the war effort. Rather, they simply called out anyone who did not support going to war as unpatriotic, showing how identity trumped deliberation and the patriotic/unpatriotic binary flourished. The Bush administration also enacted a binary between the \u201cChristian West\u201d and \u201cMuslim Middle East\u201d as a way to further stake the war on identities rather than sound, policy debate. With these binaries, Roberts-Miller shows how the conditions for the disastrous Iraq War were achieved through demagogic rhetoric. Many in Congress and the public positioned debate itself as being anti-American, instead opting for na\u00efve, patriotic support of the war. Without a strong policy debate, the American war strategy relied purely on best-case scenarios that did not happen. According to Roberts-Miller, relying on public debate, rather than demagoguery, may have prevented the invasion of Iraq or \u201cat worst, have led to a better-planned war\u201d with contingencies being considered (47).Chapter 2 builds on the binary paired terms of punishment and reward, using a number of case studies to exemplify how these terms are used in demagogic rhetoric. The first explored is Cleon from Ancient Athens. Cleon sets up the binary of everyone being either a friend or enemy and every act being either reward or punishment. Roberts-Miller works this pairing into a unique ratio of punish/enemy and reward/friend, which characterize demagoguery writ large. Cleon's \u201crational\u201d assessment here shows the risks of defining demagoguery as primarily invested in leveraging emotional appeals. As Roberts-Miller pointedly observes, definitions of demagoguery as speech driven by mere strong affects is misguided since a speaker could provide good argumentation grounded in emotion, and, conversely, a speaker might be able to perform \u201cemotionless\u201d rationality without solid evidence. Instead, as Roberts-Miller explains through examples ranging from segregationists in the south to the Supreme Court decision in Hirabayashi v. United States, to illustrate how those claiming calm rationality, often through an invented middle ground, can actually perpetrate demagogic binaries and policies. In Hirabayashi, this worked its way back into a punishment/reward binary where Japanese Americans were falsely blamed (scapegoated) for sabotage during the attack on Pearl Harbor and were in need of punishment (internment).In chapter 3, Roberts-Miller elaborates further upon the features of her definition of demagoguery: scapegoating and rationality. Looking deeper into Japanese internment in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, Roberts-Miller expands beyond the Hirabayashi ruling to examine the Roberts Commission and California attorney general Earl Warren's supposedly emotionless arguments for imprisonment. A critical component of this appeal was Warren's surface-level reasonability and a supposed willingness to let the facts guide the debate surrounding internment. However, once one digs beneath the surface, it becomes clear that this rationality is merely a fa\u00e7ade. Roberts-Miller points to a lack of evidence that there was any Japanese American involvement in Pearl Harbor and the difference in treatment between Japanese Americans and German and Italian Americans as proof of prejudice rather than deliberation guiding decision making. This is used to prove that rationality markers are often deployed to conflate the difference between a logical argument and an argument that is made by appealing to logic. Ultimately, the Japanese were interned not because of logic in and of itself but because demagoguery cast them as an entity Americans should fear through misleading appeals to a nonexistent logic.Chapter 4 moves from a discussion of demagoguery that appeals to logic that, while flawed, is easy to understand to demagoguery that relies on argumentation that claims rationality but intentionally obfuscates logic. The case study here is Madison Grant's racist book Passing of the Great Race, which is considered a historically significant white supremacist text because of its prevalence in America and its appreciation by Hitler himself. Roberts-Miller deftly dissects Grant's demagogic argument for the superiority of the white/Nordic race through the inconsistencies in logic. Some specific problems include Grant's lack of definition for his central term \u201crace,\u201d an evolutionary narrative that undercuts his claims to Nordic purity, and his practically nonexistent use of citations or appeals to authority. Roberts-Miller highlights how even those contemporary reviewers who assessed the book positively cited its poor quality of argument as a negative element. Thus, with his claims not clearly grounded in proper citations, Grant's authority comes from himself. Roberts-Miller's takedown of Grant works well to boost her claim that demagoguery can guise itself with pseudo-logic, while actually being logic's antithesis.Roberts-Miller's next move is to show how demagogic rhetoric can appeal to expert opinion and be seemingly intellectual, when it is actually anti-intellectual. Chapter 5 focuses on three case studies of nonscientists\u2014E. S. Cox, Theodore Bilbo, and William Tam\u2014who claimed appeals to authority and that science supported their positions (with Cox and Bilbo espousing white supremacy and Tam arguing homophobic viewpoints against gay marriage). Cox relies heavily on authorities whom he believes are right because they are good people (i.e., white). Bilbo's arguments often contradict his sources, and his sources often contradict each other. Further, the Bilbo case study works to show how demagoguery is not always a calculated maneuver, as Bilbo's political career would have been better served with a less overtly racist message. Finally, Tam shows how poor, demagogic citation practices can flourish in the digital age. Tam deflected numerous questions about his sources and the facticity of his homophobic claims as being found on the Internet, which he implicitly claimed must make them true. Here, Roberts-Miller advances more theoretical insights on the anti-intellectualism of demagoguery, bolstered most compellingly by her selection of cases that all relied on so-called expert appeals to science and, with Tam, the Internet as a whole.Roberts-Miller's conclusion again reiterates her redefinition of demagoguery and why this book has provided an important move to understanding the culture of demagoguery. Roberts-Miller then lists some topics that she could not explore in depth due to length restrictions, including gender, religion, charismatic leadership, reification, demagoguery's universality, and if demagoguery harms only in cases of an essentialized out-group identity. Indeed, I was surprised that Roberts-Miller's book largely declined to give issues of gender and other power differentials greater attention in order to present a more capacious account of demagoguery. One area in particular this book could have improved on is either providing significant cases of demagoguery on the left or explaining why this omission is necessary given her theoretical redefinition. Every major example in the body chapters of this book comes from right-leaning politicians and sympathizers. While these provide stark and compelling case examples, Roberts-Miller opens by saying, \u201cAny project that is entirely about how badly they argue is going to be a self-congratulating exercise in saying the out-group is the out-group. Trying to identify the characteristics that help people climb up the latter [sic -ladder] of extermination shouldn't be in service of purifying our communities of demagogues\u2014we are demagogues\u2014but in service of reflecting on what is persuading us. That's the goal of this book\u201d (8). As such, a case study of leftist demagoguery would have done well to illustrate her point across ideological and party lines. Or if leftist demagoguery does not exist, an explanation of why that is the case would be very insightful for future research. Nevertheless, Roberts-Miller's Rhetoric and Demagoguery provides a timely and essential intervention into our conception of demagoguery in the present day. Readers of Philosophy & Rhetoric as well as those interested in political philosophy will find much practical and scholarly utility in this book.",

Moreover, results showed the importance of social identity in predicting collective action by supporting SIMCA's key predictions that (a) affective injustice and politicized identity produced stronger effects than those of non-affective injustice and non-politicized identity; (b) identity predicted collective action against both incidental and structural disadvantages, whereas injustice and efficacy predicted collective action against incidental disadvantages better than against structural disadvantages; (c) all 3 predictors had unique medium-sized effects on collective action when controlling for between-predictor covariance; and (d) identity bridged the injustice and efficacy explanations of collective action. Results also showed more support for SIMCA than for alternative models reflecting previous attempts at theoretical integration. The authors discuss key implications for theory, practice, future research, and further integration of social and psychological perspectives on collective action.",

      "abstract": "The concept of power is central to international relations. Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do. By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms. We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect). These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire. We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.This article was first presented at a conference, \"Who Governs in Global Governance?\" at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Using the example of media rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological concept of reactivity - the idea that people change their behavior in reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured- offers a useful lens for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self-fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article describes and explains the relationships between religion and government in contemporary Saudi Arabia. It discusses the extent to which religion is practically involved in politics and governance by examining the mechanisms of domination, the actual relationships between religious scholars ('ulama') and rulers (umara'), and the means by which authority is actually implemented. The current Saudi regime, I would suggest, is best described as a theo-monarchy, that draws power from longstanding religio-cultural norms. In this context, Wahhabi Islam seems to authorize a distinctive government paradigm, one not yet recognized by the relevant Islamic literature. Notes 1. Secularism is defined here as the separation between religion and politics or between governmental practices/institutions and religious beliefs. See 'Introduction' by M. King, Secularism: The Hidden Origins of Disbelief (Cambridge: J. Clarke, 2007). 2. M.

Layish, 'Saudi Arabian Legal Reform as a Mechanism to Moderate Wahhabi Doctrine', Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol.107, No.2 (April\u2013June 1987), p.279. 7. Here, I refer to the Catholic Encyclopedia which presents theocracy as: 'form of government in which divine power governs an earthly human state, either in a personal incarnation or, more often, via religious institutional representatives (i.e., a church), replacing or dominating civil government'. See New Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), Vol.XIV, p.13. 8. Given the breadth of the topic, my theoretical analysis will draw on the deliberations of the 'Board of Senior 'Ulama'' (BSU) (hay'at kibar al-'ulama'), which, since its establishment in 1971, is at the top of the religious pyramid and issues the definitive decrees on shari'a. Emphasis will be placed on the writings and teachings of Shaykh 'Abd-al 'Aziz Ibn Baz (d.1999), the head of BSU and the most senior of the Saudi 'ulama' between 1975 and 1999. Ibn Baz, one of the most authoritative Sunni religious scholars in the twentieth century, held many important religious functions, most notably Grand Mufti of the Kingdom from 1993 until his death at the age of 89. A sustained discussion of Ibn Baz and the BSU can provide insights into the dynamic relationship between religion, politics and governance in contemporary Saudi Arabia. See M.S. al-Shuway'ir, Majmu' Majmu' Fatawa wa-Maqalat Mutanawwi'a (Riyadh: Maktabat al-Ma'arif, 1997), 13 vols., p.1:9. 9. The term 'ulama' will be approached in a broad sense, to include scholars who somehow linked to the religious functioning in Saudi Arabia. Umara', on the other hand, includes rulers mainly from within the Saudi House. 10. Cited in A.K.S. Lambton, State and Government in Medieval Islam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981), p.85. 11.

      "abstract": "The goal of this book is to formulate a modern theoretical approach for rhetorical studies in a variety of disciplines in the humanities, media research, and other cultural studies. The discipline of rhetoric originally concerned itself with linguistic forms of communication, and its basic theory was developed with such cases in mind. With respect to this ancient tradition, there are numerous books that provide a historical overview of the field. There is also a wide array of introductory works and research contributions that deal with the practice of political rhetoric. On the other hand, only a few 20th century academics have attempted to theoretically rehabilitate rhetoric (after its decline as an academic discipline in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries) and to give rhetorical theory a modern, new, and further reaching perspective. Two notable examples have been Kenneth Burke and Brian Vickers. The book begins with the assumption that rhetoric is not merely limited to linguistic action, but rather is present everywhere in the communicative world. Against this background, this work develops a modern theory of rhetoric, and demonstrates in twelve chapters how methodical rhetorical analysis can be done in selected practical fields of application (Literature, Music, Images, and Film).",

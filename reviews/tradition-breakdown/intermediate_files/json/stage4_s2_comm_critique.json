      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hermann Heller\u2019s critique of liberalism was both theoretical and conjunctural. He derided liberalism\u2019s erosion of the concept of sovereignty and lamented liberalism\u2019s complicity with the substantive inequality of his time. It its place, he argued for a restoration of the concept of popular sovereignty, as a dialectical formation of political unity and material equality through the democratic process. As a matter of political practice and strategy, however, Heller equivocated in his stance on the constitutional politics of the Weimar Republic. He initially tolerated the abrogation of parliamentary democracy due to his faith in the neutrality of the state, before diagnosing the regime as a form of authoritarian liberalism determined by the capitalist economy. This article examines Heller\u2019s theoretical and political critique of liberalism. It outlines Heller\u2019s conception of popular sovereignty against both Kelsen\u2019s legal rationalism and Schmitt\u2019s political decisionism. It also examines the significance of the interwar conjuncture, highlighting that the turn of the bourgeoisie to authoritarianism and ultimately to fascism represented a continuity of the liberal elision of the principle of popular sovereignty.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Carl Schmitt criticized liberalism by asserting that it negates politics and leads to a crisis of parliamentary democracy. Through his theories on the concept of the political and sovereign decision-making, Schmitt provided a deep analysis of these issues. Masao Maruyama not only highly valued Schmitts work but also theoretically borrowed from his ideas. However, Maruyama placed individual subjectivity at the core of his analysis, using Japans traditional culture and unique historical and social context as his focus. In doing so, Masao Maruyama both supplemented and, in some aspects, refuted Schmitts critique of liberalism. For Schmitt, the survival and integrity of the political entity are paramount, necessitating a clear distinction between friends and enemies. His critique of liberalism centers not only on its moral neutrality but also on its perceived incapacity to make sovereign decisions that guarantee the preservation of the political entity. In contrast, Maruyama contended that Japanese imperialism elevated the state as the embodiment of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, thereby positioning it as a value-laden entity, creating a metaphysical order seemingly justified by the imperative of national survival. Although this might initially appear to align with Schmitts notion of the states primacy, Maruyama ultimately critiques this belief as an ideological facade, which devolved into a mere instrument of totalitarian rule.",

      "abstract": "The article reviews critical remarks on the J. Rawls\u2019s theory of justice proposed by the thinkers of the libertarian (Nozick) and communitarian (Sandel, Taylor, McIntire) directions, and makes an attempt to refute these criticisms. In particular, with help of neokantian and contemporary liberal philosophy of law it defends the Kantian approach to the problem of justice (a priori), the admissibility of the very formulation of the issue of distributive justice (the limited state intervention in the economy and private life is argued), and grounds the Kantian concept of personality applied by J. Rawls and its compatibility with providing of morality, ideals of brotherhood and love. Among other things, the \u201cargument of Wilt Chamberlain\u201d used by libertarians is rejected, and the possibility of meaningful judgments about justice in the Rawls\u2019 situation of \u201cinitial position\u201d is proved. The author argues that the universal liberal theory of justice can be compatible with its complementary moral ideals, but for this the latter must also withstand the test of universality. The author analyzes the main ideas proposed by J. Rawls in his work \u201cPolitical Liberalism\u201d (overlapping consensus, public reason) as a response to the objections of communitarists, and argues the author\u2019s position on these ideas. In particular, it is demonstrated on the example of the worldview contradictions of believers, agnostics and atheists, that political liberalism is not philosophically neutral, and the idea of overlapping consensus has a limited scope. The conclusion is that the concept of justice cannot be philosophically neutral, and the Kantian approach to the problem of justice, also used by Rawls himself in the Theory of Justice, can be a philosophical basis, reflecting in the best way the generally accepted principles of freedom and equality.",

      "abstract": "Positivism and post positivism are two paradigms within the field of international relations (IR) that differ in their approaches to ontology (the nature of reality) and epistemology (how knowledge is acquired) in the study of international politics. Ontologically, positivists are objectivists, meaning that they believe there are objective facts (for example, selfish human nature) and laws (for example, anarchy leads to chaos) in international politics. Positivists apply common rationality and value-neutrality as epistemological tools to discover and analyze such claims regarding external and objective social reality. In this paper, I make two points. First, positivism (realism and liberalism) has a natural propensity to reify social concepts into trans historical essence to generate causal theories. However, in reality, human nature is complex and the meaning of social realities such as human nature and anarchy is conceptual and constitutive. Second, the adoption of common rationality and value-neutrality as epistemological building blocks lead positivism to a rigid and ahistorical view of human nature and anarchy. In contrast, post positivism (critical theory and constructivism) can generate a relatively nuanced and complete picture of international politics.",

Drawing from John Rawls\u2019s proviso, Franz Mang offers an internal critique of moderate Confucian perfectionism by constructing a \u201cwide view of moderate perfectionism\u201d according to which active promotion of Confucianism or Confucian values violates the liberal condition to accommodate reasonable pluralism. In this article, I will argue that Mang\u2019s internal critique not only reveals the weakness of moderate Confucian perfectionism but also pushes moderate perfectionism closer to neutrality, which can be demonstrated by adopting a pluralistic understanding of liberal neutrality. Furthermore, the pluralistic understanding of liberal neutrality leads to a convergent view of the relationship between political liberalism and moderate perfectionism, on the basis of which a modified proviso can be constructed to take advantage of both freestanding political reasons and freestanding perfectionist reasons. This modified proviso not only meets the liberal condition to accommodate reasonable pluralism but also strengthens the case for political liberalism.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines Joseph Raz\u2019s perfectionist liberalism, an alternative to liberal neutrality. Perfectionists, unlike neutralists, have done little to extend their view beyond the state to international law and institutions. It considers whether perfectionist liberalism can be a theory of legitimacy in this sphere. The discussion focuses on the neutralist worry that the moral pluralism and the conception of autonomy that are aspects of Raz\u2019s view fail to respect moral diversity and the equal standing of citizens across state boundaries. In particular, it looks at Martha Nussbaum\u2019s claim that Raz\u2019s liberalism is less stable than John Rawls\u2019s because it is incompatible with the moral views of many people. The chapter argues that this critique is not persuasive in the state context and, even if it were compelling, it would be less so in the suprastate context, due to well-known attributes of international institutions, including their limited jurisdiction and their relatively limited capacity to enforce norms and decisions.",

      "abstract": "Konings\u2019 modern and postmodern critique of capitalism suggests a new critical theory to conceptualize the inner workings of the financial system. To make his claim, the author argues that neoliberalism, through the expansion of speculation, is a response to the return to classical free market liberalism but is not the neoclassical premise of neutrality and efficiency in the marketplace. The current discussion led by policy makers in the United States and Europe focuses on the placement of external limits on the extension of credit. While the intention of some policy makers is to curb speculative practices by banks and to keep liquidity in the market, administrations from Reagan to Trump have been able to weaken protective measures of the financial system by deregulation and the destruction of the manufacturing economy. By allowing for the expansion of endogenous forces to self-regulate, the state has been able to reduce the value of labour to a technical parameter in economic policy and to restructure the economy based on the monetization of debt. An economy based on the monetization of debt and management of economic growth through inflationary targets is overly reliant on economic contingency plans. This creates a self-organizing system that promotes the perpetual refinancing of debt and justifies a \u2018too big to fail culture\u2019 based on a neoliberal ideology. Since the 2008 financial crisis, business and governmental elites have been able to capture the policy discourse on reform to address systemic problems in finance and regulatory agencies. The critique of financial governance in Capital and Time provides objective criteria for the reassessment of capital, speculation, and finance and, thereby, allows for the expansion on theoretical claims in philosophical and political economy.",

      "abstract": "Communitarian thought could be a noteworthy alternative to the prevailing moral-political realities established by liberal assumptions and presuppositions, as its interpretations on issues it broaches in the realms of being, knowledge, and value indicate. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that communitarianism is examined as an alternative to liberal thought in the literature. The role assigned to it is more so to serve as a corrective that moderates the extremes of liberal thought. This article aims to reinterpret communitarianism not as a corrective of liberalism, but as an alternative thought system to it. The main contention of the article is that, just like liberalism, communitarianism can indeed be read as a standalone political philosophy. This claim is sought to be grounded in the article by the existence of a unique philosophical foundation from which the criticisms of communitarian thinkers toward liberalism also emerge and are nourished - in other words, the fundamental premises and assumptions that make the communitarian critique \u201ccommunitarian\u201d. In this context, rather than focusing on the critiques of communitarians against liberalism, the article offers an examination that reveals the ontological, epistemological, and axiological foundations of communitarian thought.",

Further, the text analyzes the definition of personality through capacity for action (above all ethical). Recognition of this capacity is necessary, but not sufficient to attribute to a person a special status from the standpoint of political morality, since individuals also must be capable to coordinate their ethical actions with moral principles of others. Further, the text critiques Charles Larmore\u2019s moral grounding of the theory of justice on respect of persons by arguing that the concept of respect should be considered as part of the complex interrelationships with other moral concepts, such as equality. In this way, neutrality regarding content of respect, as well as neutrality regarding capacity for ethical action turns out to be insufficient.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the nature of the individual-state relationship from a holistic perspective using the descriptive method. The importance attributed to the sociality of the individual is embedded in both Eastern and Western political philosophies. The position of the individual in relation to the state and other social structures depends on the philosophical comprehension of the period and context. The emphasis on the sociality of the individual, as represented in the critique of classical liberalism\u2019s perception of the individual, has a historical basis, is also found in Confucian ethics and Hegel\u2019s philosophical approach, and which thereby implies a linear understanding. Most notably, since the last quarter of the 20th century, liberal communitarians have reinvigorated debate by criticizing classical liberal conception of the individual. In contrast to classical liberalism\u2019s transcendental concept of the individual, which is free from social/collective features, liberal communitarians highlight the significance of social ties and structures. Implicitly acknowledging the importance of the collective ties of the individual, this study examines the individual\u2019s relationship with collective structures, especially the state, in Confucianism, Hegelian political thought, and communitarianism, argues that the relationship between the two has been a subject of constant debate from past to present.",

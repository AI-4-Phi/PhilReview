      "abstract": "The article offers an interpretation of the philosophy of romanticism as a historical and philosophical phenomenon based on recent studies. It is shown that the analysis of the romantic tradition is relevant in the context of modern tendencies to revise the classical historical-philosophical canon. It is proposed to distinguish romanticism as a philosophical phenomenon from a historical and cultural phenomenon. Specifically, romanticism as a philosophical phenomenon is localized in Germany at the end of the 18th century, while its multiple variations should be discussed in the context of a broader historical-philosophical phenomenon. It is shown that romanticism as a philosophical phenomenon has its foundations in querelle des Anciens et des Modernes. However, this movement\u2019s central ideas are existential, political, and epistemological. In particular, representatives of the philosophy of romanticism \u201cradicalize\u201d the Enlightenment, offering original ideas of individuality (authenticity, Buildung), society (new mythology), and culture (opposing it to civilization). Romanticism is still of interest as one of the first manifestations of a critical reaction to modern society and the problems arising from industrialization and urbanization. At most, it should also contain the foundations of the continental tradition of philosophizing, which is aimed at a critical attitude toward modernity. The article also examines the interpretations of romanticism by Richard Rorty and Charles Taylor. It is shown that for both authors, the importance of romanticism is determined by its emphasis on the primacy of imagination over reason. This idea not only undermines the classical rational tradition but also paves the way for a new conception of individuality and society in the conditions of the variability of historical existence. Specifically, it finds continuation in connection with the idea of self-assertion of the subject in the conditions of the finitude of existence, the orientation of philosophy towards the future, and the creation of new social practices.",

In the conditions of secularization, the decline of church authority, the spread of political radicalism, the need for apologetic understanding of the biblical heritage increased. A systematic analysis of the signs, approaches and methods of rationalism in biblical studies has been heuristicly valuable, in particular: criticism of panlogism, abstract schematics, empirically groundless extrapolations and generalizations. At the same time, Kyiv Biblical scholars criticized the insolvent apologetic techniques: the literalistic view of the inspiration, the absolute authority of the tradition, the excessive spiritualization in the perception of the biblical prophecy. Their main goal was to prove the authenticity and authenticity of the content of biblical books and the very biblical hystory. The methodological impulse for the biblical apologetics was the intensification of supranaturalism, providentialism, and soteriology in the reading and interpretation of the Bible - just as the Holy Scriptures of the Church. The apologetic motive was to determine both scientific bibliological studies, and school teaching and study of the Bible, and private and public Biblical reading for religious and moral instruction.",

Camera, tape recorder, print machine have turned the work of art to be mass consumption, autonomous from tradition and ritual, and it has now a political function. According to Benjamin all of those new technologies have faded up the aura since the work of art lost its authenticity and its uniqueness. We are in the different era than Benjamin\u2019s because nowadays digital reproduction by means of the internet ends the need of medium for the work of art, multiply and spread it very rapidly. The author comments on Benjamin\u2019s analysis and applies it to discuss the ontological, epistemological, and axiological issues of the work of art in the age of digital reproduction.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Since the middle of the twentieth century, partly through the wide influence of Abraham Heschel\u2019s work on the prophets and prophesy in Ancient Israel, an image of the prophet as an \u2018outsider\u2019 has emerged. This image contrasts, in critical ways, with an image of \u2018the prophet\u2019 that appears central in Spinoza\u2019s Theologico-Political Treatise. Spinoza\u2019s Treatise, however, is an inaugural text for the historical-critical study of prophesy in ancient Israel; and it casts a long shadow over Heschel\u2019s view of prophesy. I identify three areas of tension between their images of prophets. The contrasts reveal that Heschel, and other twentieth century theorists of prophesy invest prophetic authority and authenticity in religious experience whose transformative power is a function of its \u2018breaking through\u2019 oppressive social/religious institutions and norms \u2018from the outside.\u2019 Spinoza, by contrast, accounts for prophetic authority via \u2018immanence\u2019: the location of prophets within a tradition of law and common \u2018usage\u2019 with the political institutions which they criticise and challenge. I argue, finally, that Spinoza\u2019s image can accommodate the prophetic \u2018outsider\u2019 and rebel, and in a way that suggests that prophesy must now be conceived as encompassing social critique within the context of the arts.",

Using new materials about Fardid's intellectual biography and interviews with thirteen individuals, Ali Mirsepassi pieces together the striking story of Fardid's life and intellectual legacy. Each interview in turn sheds light on Iran's twentieth-century intellectual and political self-construction and highlights Fardid's important role and influence in the creation of Iranian modernity. The Fardid phenomenon was unique to the Iranian story, and yet contributed to a broader twentieth-century Heideggerian tradition that marked the political destiny of other countries under a similar ideological sway. Through these accounts, Mirsepassi cuts to the nerve of how deadly political 'authenticity movements' take hold of modern societies and spread their ideology. Combining a sociological framework with the realities of lived experience, he examines Iran's recent and astonishing upheavals, experiments, and mass mobilizations.",

Taylor considers such cultural heritages\u00a0 as moral values in themselves which help individual to understand himself and to fulfil himself from one hand and from the other hand they represent an essential base out of which the individual proceeds with understanding the legitimate political\u00a0 bases upon which general decisions and regulations have to be built .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 undoubtedly\u00a0 our research\u00a0 raise way serious questions\u00a0 foremost among which are :what is the attitude\u00a0 of Taylor towards morality ?and how could he connect such morality with great values such as goodness ,justice\u00a0 and equality ?how could the legitimacy of identity multiplicity ,be theoretically\u00a0 based without any con traditions with\u00a0 contractual citizen ship values ?did the recognition of \u00a0\u00a0cultural independence lead to the split of national unity and to the return of tribal system or civil war as Weber described it .here lies the great importance of our research ,in attempting to find answers to the above mentioned\u00a0 critical questions .in fact this research consists of an introduction\u00a0 and four main\u00a0 chapter .the first chapter:\u00a0 the malaises of modernity\u00a0 .the second chapter deals with identity and goodness . the 3rd chapter\u00a0 deals with identity and recognition .the 4th chapter is mainly concerned with she ding.

      "abstract": "The author of the article examines a phenomenon associated with a certain \u2013 today increasingly common \u2013 attitude in life that may be described, in most simple terms, as the marriage of non-authenticity with imitationism. The author focuses her attention on feelings of love (as particularly \u2018acute\u2019 and, at the same time, probably most mythologized), or rather on their literary depiction, which allows for an accurate diagnosis of the sensitivity typical of a consumer society obsessed with money, subject to the dictates of mass media and under pressure from the ideals and ideas of pop culture. A diagnosis of this kind comes in the form of Jacek Dehnel\u2019s short story Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 korepetytora (The Private Tutor\u2019s Love) which, together with three other stories, comprises the volume Balzakiana (Balzaciennes) (2008). The young Polish writer, attempting to diagnose the condition of the Polish society after the political transformation of 1989, makes a conscious reference to the distant tradition of realistic prose from the legacy of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. As for the review of the sphere of individual feelings and emotions falsified by various stereotypes and abstract ideas, one can also look to a tradition closer to Dehnel: namely the only novel of Karol Irzykowski entitled Pa\u0142uba (The Hag) (1903). The author of the article shows some similarities between the Young Poland concept of \u2018successive-world phenomena\u2019 and the contemporary vision of determining the emotional sphere through pop culture templates with the underlying experience of romantic elation. References to the diagnoses of Abraham Moles, Milan Kundera and Hermann Broch allow for highlighting the issues of \u2018exaltation as a replacement of spirituality\u2019 and kitsch as \u2018our daily aesthetic and morality\u2019.",

In the conditions of secularization, the decline of church authority, the spread of political radicalism, the need for apologetic understanding of the biblical heritage increased. A systematic analysis of the signs, approaches and methods of rationalism in biblical studies has been heuristicly valuable, in particular: criticism of panlogism, abstract schematics, empirically groundless extrapolations and generalizations. At the same time, Kyiv Biblical scholars criticized the insolvent apologetic techniques: the literalistic view of the inspiration, the absolute authority of the tradition, the excessive spiritualization in the perception of the biblical prophecy. Their main goal was to prove the authenticity and authenticity of the content of biblical books and the very biblical hystory. The methodological impulse for the biblical apologetics was the intensification of supranaturalism, providentialism, and soteriology in the reading and interpretation of the Bible - just as the Holy Scriptures of the Church. The apologetic motive was to determine both scientific bibliological studies, and school teaching and study of the Bible, and private and public Biblical reading for religious and moral instruction.",

      "abstract": "Despite several decades of attempts to interpret and articulate Nietzsche\u2019s political thought, especially its relationship with democracy, there seems to be no convergence in sight. While this might be easily written off as a consequence of that thinker\u2019s tendency for ambiguity and contradiction, I contend that there is in fact a central pillar of Nietzsche\u2019s political philosophy, authenticity. I extract this central emphasis on authenticity by offering a fresh methodological approach. This approach draws our focus to Nietzsche\u2019s technique of inversion as it applies to his critiques of democracy. Nietzsche\u2019s criticism draws us to the core of the tension between his own philosophical project and the reality of democracy in his time. This subsequently reveals what would make for an authentic democracy faithful to Nietzsche\u2019s core philosophical commitments. The gist of Nietzsche\u2019s criticism of democracy is that it is not, in fact, democracy. Yet, as I show, this is not simply critical, as Nietzsche offers a fresh alternative in the wake of this characteristic inversion. This inversion complicates our understanding of the democratic citizen, their needs, and capabilities. As such, I venture to trace the roots of his criticism, how the problem he raises affects contemporary politics, and what his proposed solution in the form of a commitment to authenticity would look like. In the end, I contend that this focus on authenticity as a central pillar of Nietzsche\u2019s political thought will not only clarify his use for political philosophy, but serve as a powerful resource for political theorists looking to use his work to think about democracy.",

While prophecy fulfilment is commonly used to assess authenticity, its unreliability calls for a more testable method grounded in Moses' model. Exploring the Deuteronomic Code, the study emphasises prophetic authenticity and employs a comparative analytical approach to investigate Jeremiah's embodiment of Mosaic traits. It suggests a revised approach to assessing prophet authenticity, advocating adherence to the Deuteronomic Covenant as a defining characteristic. The study identifies specific traits for evaluating prophetic authenticity across the Old Testament, noting some discontinuity between Jeremiah and the Deuteronomic Covenant. It underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to evaluating prophetic authenticity.",

Drawing on archival material, it argues that Rawls's fascination with tradition arose out of his own pedagogical engagement with the debate around the \u201cdeath of political philosophy\u201d in the 1950s. Throughout, I highlight the significance of Rawls's teaching\u2014beginning with his earliest lectures on social and political philosophy at Cornell, to his shifting views on \u201cthe tradition\u201d in his published works, culminating in the increasingly contextually minded and irenic approach on display in Political Liberalism (1993) and Justice as Fairness. This neglected aspect of the \u201chistorical Rawls\u201d offers insight into how Rawls himself might have read \u201cJohn Rawls\u201d as a figure in the history of political thought\u2014and reveals that he spent a lot more time contemplating that question than one might think.",

      "abstract": "Scholars have often taken Foucault by his words and insisted that his philosophy is completely at odds and opposed to Sartre\u2019s\u2014and Beauvoir\u2019s\u2014existentialism. However, it is my contention that Foucault\u2019s own appreciation and intense critique of existentialist philosophy stems from a series of misunderstandings with regards to the notions of the subject, freedom, and historicity. The purpose of my essay will be to explore affinities between Foucauldian and existentialist philosophy as found in Sartre and Beauvoir\u2019s works, focusing particularly on the ethical notions of authenticity and distantiation from oneself. Indeed, if the existentialist ideal of authenticity as offered by Sartre and Beauvoir aims at a fluctuating self that \u201cis what it is not and is not what it is,\u201d it stands close to the Foucauldian subject of the aesthetics of existence who cares for itself as a subject that is none other than the subject of its own desubjectivation (to pick up on Giorgio Agamben\u2019s analysis).1 The aporia is that of a subject that must care for oneself, yet must distantiate oneself from oneself. Tackling this aporia and explaining its mechanism, my essay will show how the existentialist analysis of authenticity can help articulate the ethical and the political in Foucault, given that the caring self is always an ethico-political agent. The subject that emerges from these processes of individuation/un-individuation is an ambiguous fluctuating subject\u2014the only possible actor in an ever-evolving and morphing political arena.",

Based on a systematic analysis of Trump\u2019s use of this notion, I identified five main normative propositions organizing Trump\u2019s anti-PC rhetoric. Viewed together, these propositions add up to a rehabilitation of White working-class culture but also outline an emerging late-modern version of the authenticity ethic, whose power extends far beyond the working class. This ethic (as manifested in Trump\u2019s anti-PC rhetoric) transforms the role of morality and the sacred in political drama and in symbolic struggles over social worth. Rather than presenting his commitment to moral values, ideals, and allegedly-universal rules, Trump used anti-PC rhetoric to expose and criticize the symbolic self-interests of others who speak on behalf of these values, rules, and ideals to claim superiority (and thus ironically mimicked the sociological critique of symbolic violence to legitimize bigotry). Yet, the sacred is not completely banished from political drama: authenticity as a principle of worth guiding moral evaluation and argumentation is revealed as a sacred in denial . The case of Trump\u2019s anti-PC rhetoric thus allows theorizing the implications of the authenticity ethic for the dynamics of social struggles over recognized worth and for the role of ideals in the presentation of self in politics and beyond.",

In addition to sharing how he researched his book, Serazio discusses the following topics with the panelists: what is meant by authenticity and being \"real\"; how various sectors use media to produce and manufacture authenticity; the link between authenticity and trust; the production of personalities and its impact on identities and inequalities, especially those based on race, gender, and class; the responsibility of social media companies in shaping how individuals in society and culture view realness; the influence of social media algorithms; and the potential ways in which instructors could use the book in classrooms.",

The study addresses the issue of how religious traditions, often perceived as static, can be reinterpreted to address contemporary social challenges such as economic inequality and political oppression. Employing a textual analysis method, the research examines Hanafi's key works, including\u00a0Min Al-Aqidah Ila Al-Thawrah\u00a0and\u00a0Al-Turath wa al-Tajdid, to analyze his critique of traditional Islamic conservatism and his emphasis on the dynamic role of sacredness in driving social change. The findings reveal that Hanafi redefines Islamic authenticity by integrating spiritual values with practical social action, challenging the overemphasis on transcendental aspects in Sufism. This study contributes to the discourse on Islamic thought by offering a new framework that bridges spirituality with societal transformation, providing insights for scholars and policymakers seeking to reconcile religious traditions with modern challenges.",

The article underscores Arkoun's significance as an Islamic philosopher who successfully integrates the \"authenticity of Islam\" with a broad understanding of contemporary social sciences, giving rise to the concept of Applied Islamology. With a life background immersed in two traditions, Islam (Algeria) and France (the West), Arkoun endeavors to reconcile various aspects of life from both civilizations.The research methodology employs descriptive, historical, comparative, and synthetic analysis approaches. Data collection involves extensive literature research on Arkoun's works, both his writings and relevant contributions from other authors. Based on a philosophical-critical examination of the data, it is concluded that Arkoun plays a significant role in shaping an inclusive study of Islam for the future. The findings offer profound insights into Arkoun's contribution to connecting and harmonizing Islamic thought with contemporary social sciences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For a discipline as philosophically and temporally sensitive as International Relations, it is curious that Martin Heidegger, widely considered the most important philosopher of the twentieth century, has only recently begun to receive disciplinary attention. It is also noteworthy that as IR begins to grapple with right-wing extremism, it has not addressed Heidegger\u2019s fascist politics. Conducting a close reading of his account of existence in time, this article argues that from his magnum opus to his final diaries, Heidegger prefigured many existentialist discussions, but his particular conceptualisations of time, temporality, and authentic Being lent political life a dangerous edge. Scrutinising both the conceptual and practical consequences of Heidegger\u2019s thought, this article traces key tensions in his claims that, to realise true Selfhood, we must overcome social time on the road to death. This antagonism encourages overly individuated and aggressive habits of thought and action that reject the possibilities of co-existence. We can see this in how Heidegger\u2019s obsession with authenticity over time pushed him deeper into Nazism, and in the ways that his existential vernacular resounds through today\u2019s right-wing renaissance. Juxtaposing authenticity, then and now, helps draw out the distinctively temporal dynamics of Heidegger\u2019s existentialism as well as the existential politics of our time.",

      "abstract": "It is morally impossible, Locke argued, for individuals to consensually establish absolute rule over themselves. That would be to transfer to rulers a power that is not ours, but God\u2019s alone: ownership of our lives. This article analyses the conceptual presuppositions of Locke\u2019s argument for the moral impossibility of self-enslavement through a comparison with other classical social contract theorists, including Grotius, Hobbes and Pufendorf. Despite notoriously defending the permissibility of voluntary enslavement of individuals and even entire peoples, Grotius similarly endorsed divine ownership of human life. He could do so coherently, we show, because he denied that despotic power gives rulers rights in the lives of their subjects. Masters do not own slaves in the way we own material things (which we may destroy at will). Reworking received Roman law categories, Grotius maintained that \u2018perfect slavery\u2019 consists in masters having a personal right to the slave\u2019s perpetual service; a condition equivalent to what Locke called \u2018drudgery\u2019 and deemed permissible. Our analysis of this unpalatable set of ideas reveals that Locke\u2019s argument is premised upon idiosyncratic conceptions of slavery and absolutism, disavowed by prominent defenders of absolutism in the classical social contract tradition. It is hence less powerful than commonly believed.",

      "abstract": "In answering the question, \u2018What is a conspiracy theory?\u2019 scholars typically take an epistemological view, with many asking whether the term\u2019s pejorative use as a marker of obvious falsehood is justified. Especially among philosophers, a consensus has emerged that conspiracy theories should not be dismissed as prima facie false, that each should be judged on its own merits. However, while some philosophers have encouraged social scientists to embrace this epistemological view of conspiracy theories, this article argues that it is less useful for those of us working in political studies. We are right to worry about being too dismissive of all charges of conspiracy, but conspiracy theorising involves more than just making truth claims; it is about politics, history and culture too. In approaching it through the narrow lens of epistemology, we miss much of what is happening in conspiracy theorising. My aim in this article is to offer a new framework for analysing conspiracy theorising as a practice, rather than as a category of explanation. This framework builds on Michael Billig and Jovan Byford\u2019s idea of the conspiracy theory tradition, showing conspiracy theorising to involve the recycling and adaptation of pre-existing ideas, themes and texts to fit new situations.",

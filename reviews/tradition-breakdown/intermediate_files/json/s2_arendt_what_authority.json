      "abstract": "Breads White and Brown: Their Place in Thought and Social History. By R. A. McCance, C.B.E., F.R.S., M.A., Ph.D., M.D., F.R.C.P., and E. M. Widdowson, D.Sc., Ph.D. (Pp. 174+xi. 30s.) London: Pitman Medical Publishing Co. Ltd. 1956. Since the beginning of this month the composition of the nation's flour, except for whole meal, has been left to the discretion of the millers, subject only to its containing stipulated quantities of vitamin B,, nicotinic acid, iron, and chalk, and to an agreement that the improver agene will not be used. The appearance of this book by two eminent authorities on bread, therefore, has been nicely timed to attract widespread interest. If the nature of our daily bread is to be decided by a policy of laisser-faire, after a period of sixteen years of benevolent bureaucracy, it may be instructive to know what has happened in the past and to surmise what may happen in the future. The period covered by McCance and Widdowson dates from 430 B.C. to A.D. 1955. A bibliography covers writers so diverse as Hippocrates, Plato, Virgil, Chaucer, Shakespeare, George III and V, Alphonse Daudet, Lloyd George, J. H. Plumb, and Mother Goose. Classical allusions abound, and for the full appreciation of the first chapter, on bread in early Mediterranean civilization, a knowledge of Greek and Latin will be helpful. The hours spent by the authors in libraries, and in consultations with colleagues well versed in the humanities, have borne fruit in a history of bread which is not only instructive but easy and fascinating to read. The eye is charmed by a richly coloured picture, supplied by the British Museum, which depicts the Duke of Lancaster entertaining the King of Portugal, together with several mitred bishops, to a fifteenth-century dinner, which seems to consist mainly of manchets of white bread. After perusing chapters on mediaeval and modem England, the eighteenth century, peace and plenty (1820-1914), shortages and war (1914-21), return to plenty (1921-9), and the second war (1939-45), the thoughtful reader is left with the impression that the problems by which we are confronted to-day have been faced repeatedly before. Without going into ancient history we may note that brown or brownish bread was advocated in 1840 by Graham, in 1885 by Allinson, and in 1909 by a Bread and Food Reform League, which recommended a \" standard bread \" containing the wheat germ. The first two of these campaigns were prompted by a general assumption of the health-giving properties of whole meal, and by a religious belief that God had intended the wheat berry as the ideal food for man. During the third campaign, however, knowledge of the distribution of vitamins in the outer layers of the berry had begun to dawn. Advocates of fine flour countered the reports of higher contents of vitamins and minerals in the brown by claiming higher digestibility for the white. Throughout the years the weight of medical opinion has alternated between preference for brown or white, according to such new evidence as the protagonists of each colour have produced. During the first and second world wars, of course, shipping considerations favoured brownish flour, which enabled an increased yield to be obtained from each ton of wheat which was imported. Until recently, however, white flour has always been more popular with the public than brown flour. We are told by the millers that the same preference for the greatest possible whiteness is also shown between flour of 70%/. -extraction and slightly offwhite flour of 80% extraction, whenever these two types can be bought for the same price. In their extensive experiments in German orphanages, which are briefly recapitulated in the present book, Widdowson and McCance were unable to demonstrate any differences between the nutritive values of various brown and white flours, fortified or not with vitamins and minerals, as measured by their powers to promote growth and maintain health. Since children grew well on diets containing large amounts of bread, either white or brown, the conclusion was drawn that bread is a much more nutritious food than had previously been supposed. Except when the diet is otherwise lacking in B vitamins and iron, however, the importance of the superiority of brown bread in these nutrients is considered to have been overemphasized. The reader is left, therefore, with the impression that the star of white bread, made from 70% flour, is in the ascendant. A semi-popular book obviously cannot deal with the statistical treatment of the complicated mass of scientific evidence which was obtained in the German experiments, nor would the review of such a book be a fitting place for a detailed discussion of this evidence. We may perhaps question the authors, however, on their stressing of all sorts of psychological and social motives for preferring white or brown bread, to the virtual exclusion of the simple question of taste. Thus we are told of doddering old men who have nostalgic memories of the kind of bread which they ate during their youth. Their recollected preference is apparently regarded by our authors as nothing more than \" a psychological escape from the present to which a man has failed to adapt himself, or with which he cannot keep pace.\" If our bread follows the American pattern, we may well become familiar during the next few months with a material which has the consistency of sponge rubber and the insipidity of cotton-wool. It will be a poor consolation, if we dislike it, to be told that our objections are due not to the normal discriminating powers of our palate but merely to advancing senility. T. MOORE.",

      "abstract": "It has long been recognised that the top-down, science-centred approach of development has failed to deliver its promises. The bottom-up participatory approach, advocated a couple of decades ago, has also not yielded the desired results. Indigenous Knowledge (IK) research forms one of the latest development models, which aims to address local needs more effectively. This volume, a collection of papers presented at the ASA conference 2000, is an attempt by anthropologis ts to contribute to the debate and carve their own niche in the process. Two broad themes (and various other interrelated sub themes) provide the common thread to a richly diverse volume. Firstly, what is IK, and what forms does its relationship with science take? Secondly, what are the possible methodologies that can be used to foster meaningful dialogue between, and encourage the integration of, the different knowledge systems in the development process? The first chapter is introductory and Sillitoe analyses the main themes dealt with in the volume. The term IK \u2013 also known as local knowledge, citizen knowledge, traditional knowledge, folk science, people\u2019s knowledge, each with subtle differences, formulated within their own contexts \u2013 has, in the 20 th century, been \u2018muted, rejected and subsequently discovered and celebrated\u2019 (237). The term has nevertheless provoked criticism because IK is seen as static, unchanging, and bounded, whereas in practice it is ever changing and dynamic. Paul Sillitoe defines it as \u2018a unique formulation of knowledge coming from a range of sources rooted in local cultures, a dynamic and ever changing pastiche of past \u2018tradition\u2019 and present invention with a view to the future\u2019 (113). The contributors argue that development cannot be meaningful unless IK is integrated into the development process. However, historically, IK has been, and largely continues to be seen as inferior to science. The volume explores ways of addressing this power imbalance, integrating the two knowledge systems and what the anthropologist\u2019s role in this process might be. It also critically analyses the ethical issues, disciplinary demands and other dilemmas faced by anthropologists. Key to this, is that anyone writing and engaging critically in action research has to deal with the crisis of representation. Who can write with authority about whom, and who owns the final product, (i.e. the ethnography) with respect to intellectual property rights? This is made more complex as participatory research is also informed by",

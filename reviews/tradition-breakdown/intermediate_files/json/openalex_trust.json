      "abstract": "Economists have long warned about the pernicious impacts of corruption, arguing that it increases transaction costs, reduces investment incentives, and ultimately results in reduced economic growth. Political scientists, on the other hand, ever the realists, have had a much more ambivalent view of the problem. Indeed, much classic literature focusing on the Third World saw corruption as functional for political development, enabling citizens to overcome intransigent, inefficient bureaucracies while increasing loyalty to the political system. More recent research, however, points in the opposite direction toward an erosion of public support for corrupt regimes. A series of serious methodological problems has prevented the testing of these contradictory assertions about the impact of corruption. This article uses national sample survey data, with a total N of over 9,000, from four Latin American countries to test the effect of corruption experiences on belief in the legitimacy of the political system. It finds that independent of socioeconomic, demographic, and partisan identification, exposure to corruption erodes belief in the political system and reduces interpersonal trust. The evidence seems clear, at least for these four countries, that corruption carries with it important political costs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The phenomenon of declining political trust among the American public has been widely discussed, with the explanations often focusing on specific historical events or the unique problems of American political institutions. We first demonstrate that public doubts about politicians and government are spreading across almost all advanced industrial democracies. The pervasiveness of this trend suggests that common social forces are affecting these nations, and we examine the social correlates of the decrease in trust. We find the greatest declines are among the better-educated and upper social status. These results suggest that changing citizen expectations, rather than the failure of governments, are prompting the erosion of political support in advanced industrial democracies. Notes The data analyzed in this article were provided by the Inter-university Consortium for Social and Political Research, the Zentralarchiv fuer empirische Sozialforschung, the ESRC Archive at Essex University, the Norwegian Data Services, the Steinmetz Archive, and the Swedish Data Archive. I am indebted to the national election study teams for collecting these data and making it available for secondary analysis. I would also like to thank Martin Wattenber and Ian McAllister for their comments on these analyses, and the anonymous reviewers of a prior version of this paper for their comments. For a discussion of the different dimensions of political support see Easton (1965 Easton D (1965) A Systems Analysis of Political Life, Wiley New York [Google Scholar], 1975 Easton D (1975) \u2018A reassessment of the concept of political support\u2019 British Journal of Political Science vol. 5 pp. 435\u2013457 [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) Norris (1999 Norris P (ed.) (1999) Critical Citizens: Global Support for Democratic Government, Oxford University Press Oxford[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), and Klingemann (1999 Klingemann H-D (1999) \u2018Mapping political support in the 1990s\u2019 in Critical Citizens ed. P. Norris Oxford University Press Oxford[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). Dalton (2004 Dalton R (2004) Democratic Challenges, Democratic Choices: The Erosion of Political Support in Advanced Industrial Democracies, Oxford University Press Oxford[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) demonstrates that democratic norms and support for democracy as a regime form have apparently increased over this same time period, as has national pride as a measure of support for the political community. In contrast, trust in politicians, political parties and political institutions has generally eroded over this same period in most advanced industrial democracies. There is a rich ongoing debate on the theoretical and empirical meaning of political trust, and the relationship of these items to other dimensions of political support (Hardin, 2002 Hardin R (2002) Trust and Trustworthiness, Russell Sage New York [Google Scholar]; Braitwaite & Levi, 1998 Braithwaite V Levi M (eds) (1998) Trust and Governance, Russell Sage New York [Google Scholar]). While acknowledging these questions, we believe that trust in government is a meaningful theoretical and empirical concept as measured by the Michigan battery. Although one may developed improved or alternative measures of trust or political support, the tracking of these existing indicators over time provides a valuable empirical base for research on political support. We end our analyses in most nations with data up until 2000. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, several polls found a sharp increase in Americans\u2019 trust in government. By 2002, however, trust levels were clearly regressing to their prior levels (Dalton, 2004 Dalton R (2004) Democratic Challenges, Democratic Choices: The Erosion of Political Support in Advanced Industrial Democracies, Oxford University Press Oxford[Crossref] , [Google Scholar], chapter 2). Thus, for the sake of cross-national consistency we end our US analyses with data from the 2000 American National Election Study. The specific question wordings and data sources are available from the author. We measured the statistical significance of trends based only on the number of aggregate survey time points in each nation. Dalton and Wattenberg (2000 Dalton R M. (eds) (2000) Parties without Partisans: Political Change in Advanced Industrial Democracies, Oxford University Press Oxford [Google Scholar], pp. 62\u201363), however, present a more extensive discussion of the alternative ways to measure statistical significance in public opinion survey series. Although we describe trends in linear terms, we know that not all trends have followed a straight line descent. In the United States, for example, early declines lowered trust in politicians to a plateau and opinion trends have fluctuated around this new baseline for the last two decades. In some nations support there are obvious positive and negative deviations in the long-term trend for specific elections. Our general expectation is that over the last third of the twentieth century the general trend is downward, although there are variations in the patterns of decline. Thus, we use linear trends to measure whether the general pattern is one of decreasing trust (albeit not necessarily linear). One common limitation of these surveys is their short length for many nations. If the American series had only started in 1976, for example, the marked drop in political trust would be less evident (or even invisible). The respective 1976\u201396 coefficients would be: trust (0.057), crooked (0.114), and don't care (\u22120.714). I suspect that the Dutch time series begins too late to capture the stable period of Dutch politics before the end of pillarization and the realignment of the party system in the late 1960s (what would be equivalent to US opinion levels post-1974 as described in the preceding footnote). Rudy Andeweg (1992 Andeweg R (1992) Dutch Voters Adrift, University of Leiden Leiden [Google Scholar], p. 183), for instance, maintains that the Provo violence of 1965\u201366 damaged the legitimacy of government and authority more generally, and that these changes of public orientations occurred before the first Dutch election studies in the 1970s. For the United States we use the \u2018trust the government to do right\u2019 question because it is available for the longest time span. The \u2018few big interests\u2019 series only begins in 1964 and the \u2018don't care\u2019 item used in other nations changes wording in the United States. Because we are looking for small effects, we have tried to maximize our N by coding only three educational groupings: (1) less than high school degree, (2) high school degree, (3) some college or more education. The results from pairs of adjacent election studies were combined to further increase the group Ns for the figure. There is not a single common question that has been asked over time in all nations, so the analyses use a few different items. We began with the \u2018don't care\u2019 question, including another indicator when multiple measures were available. In a few cases the \u2018don't care\u2019 question was not asked, so we used another trust item from Table 1. Not all the aggregate trends in Table 1 are publicly available in raw data form for analysis; we have been able to acquire the survey data for only about half the nations from the table.To maximize the number of nations for analysis, we utilized additional data sets when the national election surveys were not available. The pairing of the 1974\u201375 Political Action data with the 1995\u201398 World Values Survey provides data for Germany, Finland and Switzerland and one timepoint for the British comparisons. These two surveys included the \u2018few big interests\u2019 question, which tracks the same patterns as displayed in Table 1. In more precise terms, the year of the survey is coded 0 for the first timepoint and 1 for the second timepoint. I then created an interaction term that multiplies education by this dummy variable. Thus the equation can be interpreted as two separate models. First survey: a+b1 (educ); the other variables have a value of 0 in this year. Second survey: (a+b3)+(b1 +b2) (educ); b3 is from the interaction term is the decrease in the intercept between timepoints, and b2 is the adjustment of the education slope for the second timepoint. We consider the US a conservative estimate of educational effects. First, the interaction coefficient is higher in most other nations in Table 2. In addition, the rise in educational levels has been greater for most other nations over a comparable time period. Measuring effects is not straightforward because multiple factors are involved. We developed the following estimates based on what we felt were reasonable assumptions. The mean levels of trust dropped from 2.92 in 1958 to 2.41 in 1996\u20132000, for a change of 0.51. At the same time, the mean educational level increased from 2.81 to 4.11, for a change of 1.30. We used the results of Table 2 to estimate the impact of the changing relationship between education and political trust. If the educational relationship had remained as in 1958, then rising educational levels would have increased political trust by 0.045 (0.035\u00d71.30). Instead, the negative relationship in 1996\u20132000 and the change in mean education lowered trust by \u22120.048 (\u22120.037\u00d71.30). When both effects are combined, this produces a \u22120.093 shift in political trust, which is approximately a fifth of the total decline over time (\u22120.51). The ideal analyses would replicate the detail of our US analyses across all the available time points in each nation. This should be an agenda for future research, to assemble the national data series to replicate the analyses now possible with the ANES. Still, the consistency of the results in Table 2 suggests the accuracy of the general pattern as a baseline for further detailed national analyses. Because we are looking for small effects, we have tried to maximize our N for each generation by coding for broad grouping: (1) born in 1909 or before, (2) born 1910\u201329, (3) born 1930\u201349, and (4) born 1950 and later. The results from two adjacent election studies were combined to further increase the group N for Figure 3. For the analyses in Table 2 we recoded the year of the survey as count of biennial elections with 1958=1 and the 2000 survey=22. This avoided the perfect correction between variables and interaction terms that would occur if the simple year of study were used. We first recoded the seven point party identification question so that 1=strong identification with the opposition party and 7=strong identification of the incumbent president's party. The second variable was a dichotomous coding with 0=Democratic presidential administration and 1=Republican administration.",

Direct democracy is one of the most prominent, far\u2010reaching and popular remedies proposed in response to such diagnoses. It, by allowing citizens to directly vote on questions usually decided by representatives, seems intuitively appealing as an obvious extension and deepening of democracy. In this article I survey the potentials but also pitfalls of an increased institutionalization of direct democracy and use thereof in the countries of the EU focusing on the three key aspects identified above: representation, turnout and citizens\u2019 political support.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews and assesses the outcome of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Paris in December 2015. It argues that the Paris Agreement breaks new ground in international climate policy, by acknowledging the primacy of domestic politics in climate change and allowing countries to set their own level of ambition for climate change mitigation. It creates a framework for making voluntary pledges that can be compared and reviewed internationally, in the hope that global ambition can be increased through a process of 'naming and shaming'. By sidestepping distributional conflicts, the Paris Agreement manages to remove one of the biggest barriers to international climate cooperation. It recognizes that none of the major powers can be forced into drastic emissions cuts. However, instead of leaving mitigation efforts to an entirely bottom-up logic, it embeds country pledges in an international system of climate accountability and a 'ratchet mechanism', thus offering the chance of more durable international cooperation. At the same time, it is far from clear whether the treaty can actually deliver on the urgent need to de-carbonize the global economy. The past record of climate policies suggests that governments have a tendency to express lofty aspirations but avoid tough decisions. For the Paris Agreement to make a difference, the new logic of 'pledge and review' will need to mobilize international and domestic pressure and generate political momentum behind more substantial climate policies worldwide. It matters, therefore, whether the Paris Agreement's new approach can be made to work.",

In part this represents a response to the concerns about \u2018new public management\u2019, but it also provides an interesting way of viewing what public sector organisations and public managers actually do. The purpose of this article is to examine this emerging approach by reviewing new public management and contrasting this with a public value paradigm. This provides the basis for a conceptual discussion of differences in approach, but also for pointing to some practical implications for both public sector management and public sector managers.",

      "abstract": "This article questions the fashionable ideas that bureaucratic organization is an obsolescent, undesirable, and non-viable form of administration and that there is an inevitable and irreversible paradigmatic shift towards market- or network-organization. In contrast, the paper argues that contemporary democracies are involved in another round in a perennial debate and ideological struggle over what are desirable forms of administration and government: that is, a struggle over institutional identities and institutional balances. The argument is not that bureaucratic organization is a panacea and the answer to all challenges of public administration. Rather, bureaucratic organization is part of a repertoire of overlapping, supplementary, and competing forms coexisting in contemporary democracies, and so are market-organization and network-organization. Rediscovering Weber's analysis of bureaucratic organization, then, enriches our understanding of public administration. This is in particular true when we (a) include bureaucracy as an institution, not only an instrument; (b) look at the empirical studies in their time and context, not only at Weber's ideal-types and predictions; and (c) take into account the political and normative order bureaucracy is part of, not only the internal characteristics of \u201cthe bureau.\u201d",

Instead of abstract theoretical reasoning, they offer in-depth empirical case studies. The underlying assumption, amply supported by recent literature, is that there is a wide but not infinite variety of modes of institutional change that can meaningfully be distinguished and analytically compared. It is also assumed that an empirically grounded typology of institutional change that does justice to the complexity and versatility of the subject can offer important insights on mechanisms of social and political stability and evolution generally.",

The \u2018institutionalised uncertainty\u2019 thesis, although acknowledging the possibility of future winning as a positive feature of democracy that dissuades losers from challenging outcomes, generally emphasises the problematic effects of uncertainty created by changing leadership and policy in transitional democracies; see for example Adam Przeworski, Democracy and the Market (New York, Cambridge University Press, 1991). The \u2018rule of law\u2019 thesis suggests that democratic procedures reduce ex ante uncertainty over decision rules, methods of political contestation and the rights of citizens; see for example Scott Mainwaring, \u2018Transitions to Democracy and Democratic Consolidation\u2019, in Scott Mainwaring, Guillermo O'Donnell & J.

It identifies stable periods of capital accumulation associated with particular configurations of geopolitical power, conditioned by forms of agricultural production and consumption relations within and across national spaces. Contradictory relations within food regimes produce crisis, transformation, and transition to successor regimes. This 'genealogy' traces the development of food regime analysis in relation to historical and intellectual trends over the past two decades, arguing that food regime analysis underlines agriculture's foundational role in political economy/ecology.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between economic inequality and political support is not well established in previous empirical studies in part because people commonly misperceive the level of economic inequality. Moreover, people perceiving high economic inequality may not oppose the incumbent government or political regime because they consider the inequality fair. To better capture the political outcomes of economic inequality, we investigate the effects of perceived distributive unfairness on regime support. Using data collected from the fourth wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2014-2016), we find that perceived unfairness decreases support for the current political regime. We further examine three mechanisms through which distributive unfairness dampens regime support: changes of political value orientation, redistribution demand, and social trust. We find that political value orientation plays a greater mediating role than redistribution demand and social trust, meaning that distributive unfairness depresses regime support largely through its erosive impact on citizens' affective identification with authoritarian values that underpin regime support in East Asian societies. Moreover, we find that distributive unfairness is more detrimental to regime support in autocracies and lower-income groups. Our study corroborates the importance of distributive fairness for regime legitimacy and highlights the vulnerability of autocracies to distributive unfairness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Great Recession that started in 2007/2008 has been the worst economic downturn since the crisis of the 1930s in E urope. It led to a major sovereign debt crisis, which is arguably the biggest challenge for the E uropean Union ( EU ) and its common currency. Not since the 1950s have advanced democracies experienced such a dramatic external imposition of austerity and structural reform policies through inter\u2010 or supranational organisations such as the EU and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) or as implicitly requested by international financial markets. Did this massive interference with the room for maneuver of parliaments and governments in many countries erode support for national democracy in the crisis since 2007? Did citizens realise that their national democratic institutions were no longer able to effectively decide on major economic and social policies, on economic and welfare state institutions? And did they react by concluding that this constrained democracy no longer merited further support? These are the questions guiding this article, which compares 26 EU countries in 2007\u20132011 and re\u2010analyses 78 national surveys. Aggregate data from these surveys is analysed in a time\u2010series cross\u2010section design to examine changes in democratic support at the country level. The hypotheses also are tested at the individual level by estimating a series of cross\u2010classified multilevel logistic regression models. Support for national democracy \u2013 operationalised as satisfaction with the way democracy works and as trust in parliament \u2013 declined dramatically during the crisis. This was caused both by international organisations and markets interfering with national democratic procedures and by the deteriorating situation of the national economy as perceived by individual citizens.",

Both countries have launched a number of initiatives to deal with these issues. These initiatives are unlikely to achieve their objectives without explicit consideration of the multilevel approach to change that includes the individual, group/team, organization, and larger environment/system level. Attention must be given to issues of leadership, culture, team development, and information technology at all levels. A number of contingent factors influence these efforts in both countries, which must each balance a number of tradeoffs between centralization and decentralization in efforts to sustain the impetus for quality improvement over time. The multilevel change framework and associated properties provide a framework for assessing progress along the journey.",

More specific examples of such scandals involving public officials include unfair privatization deals, official patronage, diversion of foreign aid, abuse of campaign finance, and so on (United Nations, 2000b: 3). There is a growing perception and evidence in Western democracies that the incidence of official corruption has worsened, and this is often related to the current changes in ethical standards in the public service (Maesschalck, 2004: 465). As pointed out by Hellsten and Larbi (2006: 135), \"scandals in some leading OECD countries (e.g. the UK and USA) and persistent corruption in poor countries with weak governance institutions have generated debates and concerns about public integrity and trust in government\". With regard to the recent scandals (e.g. Enron, Katrina, and Blackwater), episodes of official incompetence, and dependence on business companies, Adams and Balfour suggest that public sector ethics in the US has been degraded to the level of poor Third World countries, and that \"the revitalization of public values and ethics seems essential to avoid the further erosion of democracy and continuing loss of legitimacy for government in society\" (Adams and Balfour, 2008: 31\u201332).KeywordsBusiness EthicPublic ServiceEthical DilemmaPublic AdministrationVirtue EthicThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Cynicism generated from misinformation about trustworthy elections has attracted a growing body of individual-level social-psychological research in America and Europe. Another common problem found around the world, however, which has received far less attention, concerns credulous citizens who express considerable faith and confidence in flawed contests. This study theorises that at macro-level, the accuracy of any public judgments about trustworthy elections is likely to be mediated by the information environment in open and closed societies, as well as by the type of regime. To understand these issues, Part I summarises the conceptual and theoretical argument about trust and trustworthiness. Part II describes the sources of evidence. To apply the theory, data on public opinion is drawn from around 85 societies around the globe included in Waves 6 and 7 of the World Values Survey (2010\u20132022), with measures of electoral trust and subjective perceptions of electoral integrity among ordinary citizens. Institutional electoral performance indices are drawn from the Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem 12.0). Part III analyses how far these independent estimates match public judgments of the trustworthiness of elections in each country \u2013 and how far such relationships are conditioned by the type of information society as well as by the type of regime. Part IV highlights the key findings and considers their broader implications for understanding the macro-level conditions for trust and trustworthiness.",

      "abstract": "The participation of the general public in the research design, data collection and interpretation process together with scientists is often referred to as citizen science. While citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientific practice, developments in sensing technology, data processing and visualization, and communication of ideas and results, are creating a wide range of new opportunities for public participation in scientific research. This paper reviews the state of citizen science in a hydrological context and explores the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional ways of scientific data collection and knowledge generation for hydrological sciences and water resources management. Although hydrological data collection often involves advanced technology, the advent of robust, cheap, and low-maintenance sensing equipment provides unprecedented opportunities for data collection in a citizen science context. These data have a significant potential to create new hydrological knowledge, especially in relation to the characterization of process heterogeneity, remote regions, and human impacts on the water cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected in citizen science experiments is potentially very different from those of traditional monitoring networks. This poses challenges in terms of their processing, interpretation, and use, especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge, the quantification of uncertainties, and their role in decision support. It also requires care in designing citizen science projects such that the generated data complement optimally other available knowledge. Lastly, using 4 case studies from remote mountain regions we reflect on the challenges and opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented citizen science in water resources management, the role of scientific knowledge in the decision-making process, and the potential contestation to established community institutions posed by co-generation of new knowledge.",

Eloquent theoretical assessments have praised the absolute advantages of PES over traditional&#13;\\nconservation approaches. Some pilot PES exist in the tropics, but many field practitioners and prospective service buyers and sellers remain skeptical about the concept. This paper aims to help demystify PES for non-economists, starting with a simple and coherent defi nition of the term. It then provides practical ???how-to??? hints for PES design. It considers the likely niche for PES in the portfolio of conservation approaches. This assessment is based on a literature review, combined&#13;\\nwith field observations from research in Latin America and Asia. It concludes that service users will continue to drive PES, but their willingness to pay will only rise if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality vis-??-vis carefully established baselines, if trust-building processes with service providers are sustained, and PES recipients??? livelihood dynamics is better understood. PES best suits intermediate and/or projected threat scenarios, often in marginal lands with moderate conservation opportunity costs. People facing credible but medium-sized environmental degradation are more likely to become PES recipients than those living in relative harmony with Nature. The choice between PES cash and in-kind payments is highly context-dependent. Poor PES recipients are likely to gain from participation, though their access might be constrained and non-participating landless poor could lose out. PES is a highly promising conservation approach&#13;\\nthat can benefi t buyers, sellers and improve the resource base, but it is unlikely to completely outstrip other conservation instruments.\"",

      "abstract": "There is an increased focus on the role of Indigenous and local people and organizations in knowledge gathering, knowledge synthesis and decision-making. This is occurring at a range of scales from international policy formation to local and regional management and decision-making (Hausner, Engen, Brattland, & Fauchald, 2020; McElwee et al., 2020; Rayne et al., 2020; Teng\u00f6 et al., 2017, all this feature). There have been calls for both more and deeper partnerships between Indigenous knowledge holders and scientists (see Box 1), to address the multifaceted issues facing conserved areas and those experiencing environmental change (Mistry & Berardi, 2016). In creating and strengthening these partnerships, it may be possible to address biological conservation issues alongside ensuring sustainable livelihoods and use of resources, culture, governance and economic development (Berkes, 2009a). As scientists working in areas where Indigenous or local knowledge have an important role, we are increasingly aware of the need to learn how best to contribute to inclusive and equitable research and decision-making and how collaboration between multiple knowledge systems can lead to a richer, more effective knowledge base to inform decision-making. People who have a multigenerational long-term association with a given place, Indigenous people are often defined as those who are descended from people who have been present in a location prior to colonization by another ethnic group. The United Nations considers self-identification as Indigenous as key to being Indigenous and Indigenous people will often be communities with their own customs, traditions and laws (Hill et al., 2020). People who currently live in an area and often have multigenerational association with a given place but are not necessarily defined as Indigenous. They are connected to a given place by their livelihoods, cultural identities and knowledge (Hill et al., 2020), but do not necessarily self-identify as Indigenous, are not necessarily the earliest inhabitants of an area or inhabitants prior to a colonization by another ethnic group. There are many Peoples and communities with different cultures and understandings of natural systems, which may be profoundly different from each other. Therefore, there is not one unified definition for Indigenous and local knowledge beyond it being the knowledge of Indigenous and local people which often pertains to social\u2013ecological systems. Despite the diversity within Indigenous and local knowledge systems among peoples and cultures, there are some common characteristics such as that knowledge emerges from a close association with the land, is passed down through generations and often integrates culture, practice and beliefs (Gadgil, Berkes, & Folke, 1993). Note that people can also engage in multiple knowledge systems, such as in the case of Indigenous scientists, who are both scientists and Indigenous knowledge holders. The way in which a system is managed, or resources are allocated, and the processes of influencing, steering, controlling or managing the actions of different parts of society to achieve management goals. This process occurs at multiple spatial scales involving multiple actors for example, governments, agencies, NGOs and households and multiple and sometimes sets of conflicting goals (Mu\u00f1oz-Erickson et al., 2016). The nature of knowledge, the way in which knowledge is created and claims about what can be known, for example, do we believe there is a single objective truth or multiple possible mental constructions of reality (Moon & Blackman, 2014). Science has a specific epistemology focusing on claims of objectivity, claims about the existence and prioritization of universal facts, the importance of reasoning based on controlled experiments and causal reasoning for identifying mechanisms. Other cultural traditions have different epistemologies. A form of governance where power and responsibility for management and decision-making is shared between government and resource users through partnerships (Berkes, 2009b). People or groups with rights to land or resources, these can either be formulated in law or governed by local customs (Franks, Booker, & Roe, 2018). People or groups with interests or concerns related to land or resources (Franks et al., 2018). An important reason to find methods for working with Indigenous and local knowledge is pursuit of the best information to inform decision-making. Ecological science, like all science relying on a strict epistemological method and aiming to produce general and universal knowledge, has not had the time or opportunity to sufficiently detail the operations of nature across spatial scales. Filling these knowledge gaps can provide key opportunities either to confirm existing models, generate new hypotheses, or even make new discoveries. As the magnitude and inherent socia\u2013ecological complexity of environmental problems increase, a broader knowledge base will undoubtedly benefit informed decision-making (Stevenson, 1996). Research that includes Indigenous and local knowledge and science also helps ensure research address local concerns and wider societal concerns. Science is constantly progressing but suffers from limited information and biases of effort (see e.g. Rayne et al., 2020, this feature). Scientific data and research often have spatial, temporal and taxonomic biases (Boakes et al., 2010; Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2019). Shifting governmental policies, funding priorities and national political situations can influence the degree and focus of conservation research and seek to impact the focus on different drivers of ecological change (Pettorelli et al., 2019). The values of scientists can also influence what and where they study and their chosen methods (Roebuck & Phifer, 1999). These factors risk creating biases, which could affect the understanding derived from a single study, and when information from the scientific knowledge base is synthesized both formally and informally, systematic biases in our understanding of ecological systems and environmental change can emerge, which are likely to feed through to management and decision-making. This leads to both information deficits and biases in the knowledge base and the potential for an unjust knowledge base, biased towards the interests of those able to influence research priorities through policies, funding foci and the incentives and disincentives associated with the political climate in which scientists are operating and by the values of scientists themselves. By involving a wider range of people from a greater diversity of cultures and worldviews in research, we can seek to counter some of these often unaddressed biases. Making research more inclusive of Indigenous and local communities is important from a perspective of fair and just research and decision-making (Agrawal, 1995). The outcomes of colonial histories have often marginalized many communities and their worldviews in decision-making (Simpson, 2004). Fair and just research would not marginalize the worldviews or epistemologies of certain groups in research and its synthesis. An example of an unjust epistemological claim would be an assumption that science is by nature more correct than Indigenous and local knowledge or that Indigenous knowledge is only of value when validated by science. Fair and just decision-making similarly would ensure that multiple worldviews contribute to informed decision-making. Collaboration with Indigenous communities in research and decision-making in ways that are agreeable to communities can help counter inequities between the dominance of certain worldviews or knowledge systems (Behe & Daniel, 2018). The historical contexts and identities of Indigenous peoples and local communities vary, and therefore so to do the approaches and reasons for collaboration and participation with them. These range from collaborating with Indigenous and local communities in the hope of acting ethically to maintain good relationships with local collaborators, colleagues and communities, to working with people and knowledge systems that have been marginalized, with hope of building local capacity, advance human rights and reduce inequalities. Finally, there are practical reasons for collaboration between Indigenous and local knowledge holders to inform decision-making. Greater collaboration could also provide great opportunity to address or avoid conflicts over resource management (Castro & Nielsen, 2001). Local participation in research can lead to greater ability to influence decisions and faster implementation of those decisions (Danielsen, Burgess, Jensen, & Pirhofer-Walzl, 2010; Wall, McNie, & Garfin, 2017). This Special Feature highlights some of the many benefits of that which can occur when research and decision-making are informed by Indigenous and local knowledge and science. In environmental decision-making, Indigenous knowledge holders might possess knowledge and information from temporal and spatial scales which are normally inaccessible to scientists, since scientific research is often grounded at a specific study site, limited by political boundaries, during a discrete field season or limited to the capacities of specific technologies (Gadgil et al., 1993). In Gagnon et al. (2020, this feature) long-term community-based monitoring of the Porcupine caribou herd in northern Canada and Alaska gives access to important transnational data on caribou condition, which is outside the scope of current scientific observations (Gagnon et al., 2020, this feature). Knowledge, cultures and practices of Indigenous and local people who have inhabited the land for a long time have adapted to changing conditions and might have a history of integrating approaches to adapt to change. The transition from traditional practices to new management regimes can cause environmental degradation (Congretel & Pinton, 2020, this feature). This highlights how practice which integrates Indigenous and local knowledge can provide mechanisms for conservation and ecosystem-based adaptation (Hausner et al., 2020; Moln\u00e0r et al., 2020, both this feature). An understanding that Indigenous and local knowledge, cultures and practices adapt to changing conditions and are not static can help clarify their potential to address stewardship issues under biophysical and socio-economic change. Congretel and Pinton (2020, this feature) highlight that in addition to adaptations to local conditions, Indigenous practices can also adapt to foster resilience under increased globalization. Due to their integrative worldview, Indigenous and local knowledge systems are also excellent places to address the interdependencies between natural and cultural systems (McElwee et al., 2020, this feature). While the discussion concerning the incorporation of Indigenous and local knowledge for informing decision-making is longstanding, past and ongoing tensions exist in the relationship between Indigenous and local knowledge, science and decision-making. Understanding tensions and identifying positive examples where efforts were made to overcome them, may help alleviate these in the future. Decision-making often involves trade-offs between the multiple needs and desires of different rights holders and stakeholders. The role of scientists in informed decision-making is as one of a portion of many voices in this process. Some tensions that arise in informed management and decision-making may be hard to address from the parts of the process over which scientists have most influence, such as how knowledge and information is generated and synthesized and how different worldviews are addressed in this process. However, there is a role of scientists to think about their processes of knowledge generation and how they engage with Indigenous and local people and governance systems, which can affect tensions between participants in the informed decision-making process. For example, tensions could result from the research questions themselves and how they are asked, the research processes implemented, in addition to the use of subsequent information and knowledge in decision-making. We believe that while doing research on peoples' lands, or in areas which affect local communities, researchers much reflect on the potential implications of each stage of the process, from research formulation to decision-making. How information and knowledge generated can affect the trust and equitability in the relationship between Indigenous knowledge holders and scientists and the power relationships between knowledge holders and decision-makers. Ensuring that Indigenous knowledge holders are involved in the research from the inception and development of projects through to their reporting, is perceived to be important to progressing partnerships in the Arctic and promoting equity (Inuit Circumpolar Council, 2013; Wheeler et al., 2020, this feature). This collaboration from the start of a project has been implemented in the conservation translocations of crayfish and mudfish described by Rayne et al. (2020, this feature), involving co-designed objectives and success indicators, co-designed translocation strategies and collective implementation followed by ongoing iterative management. Here research and management are implemented through the Mi'kmaq principle of Etuaptmumk or 'Two-Eyed Seeing' which brings together multiple ways of viewing the world (Rayne et al., 2020, this feature). A key aspect of this approach is that two different knowledge systems are used side by side to view the world, rather than making one conform to the rules and assumptions of the other. Whether we view Indigenous peoples as stakeholders or self-determining nations can also substantially affect the role and agency of scientists and Indigenous knowledge holders in research (Latulippe & Klenk, 2020). Calls have been made to not only work with Indigenous peoples as self-determining nations via their institutions and processes but also support and respect autonomous Indigenous research, reflecting this status (Simpson, 2004; Wheeler et al., 2020, this feature). How information and knowledge is used can have impacts on local communities that may inadvertently erode trust between decision-makers, scientists and Indigenous and local knowledge holders. For example, while Indigenous knowledge may be used to inform environmental policies, resulting protectionist environmental policies can interfere with Indigenous people's capacity to conduct their traditional practices on their land and limit the capacity for future adaptation to environmental change (Lyver, Timoti, Davis, & Tylianakis, 2019; Lyver & Tylianakis, 2017). Here the lack of control Indigenous people sometimes has over how the knowledge and information they provide is used can create undesirable consequences for their communities. Scientists often experience the same challenge of limited control over how their research is used by policy makers, agencies and politicians. When Indigenous and local knowledge is used by decision-makers in ways that are undesirable to knowledge holders, the close association with the place in which decision-making occurs is more likely to more directly or deeply impact the culture and livelihoods of those knowledge holders and their communities. To the extent that science has a privileged entry into environmental management decisions, scientists may be in a position to advocate or vouch for fair and just processes for integrating Indigenous and local knowledge into decisions. To advance and improve collaboration between Indigenous and local knowledge holders and scientists, we need to not only be aware of the potential tensions between Indigenous and local knowledge, science and decision-making but also understand the many ways in which Indigenous and local knowledge holders and scientists have collaborated to produce novel applied research and help inform decision-making. The examples in this feature highlight the novel into between people and nature and the conservation outcomes that can be through collaboration of Indigenous knowledge holders and effective between knowledge and can be made when the knowledge and information synthesized to inform decision-making is and et al., When working with multiple knowledge systems, this can be a challenge as the values concerning different of knowledge may (Simpson, 2004). For example, the of biophysical in many natural science could be with the view of society and culture in many Indigenous systems. An Indigenous or local knowledge approach to and of or may be more on approaches rather than down biophysical these across knowledge systems might be as different knowledge holders may view systems is different To be information and knowledge need to be by all knowledge & To be information and knowledge be and world can lead to of and under different knowledge systems. To be information and knowledge be as fair and & For example, Congretel and Pinton (2020, this feature) multiple of the of the are which are and used by Indigenous and this that are both to the Indigenous and to a scientific a scientific of the cultural practices of Indigenous the shared knowledge is made to both through the of and it is as in different contexts to the participation of Indigenous people and scientists in creating the and of and can occur from in to issues such as how of a given are For example, the Indigenous people a caribou herd to with different and which not by at that time These may be important to the practices and system understandings of the people and therefore to them, but of to their is when and approaches to research, to that new processes or outcomes may need to be or they may need to have a For example, the to which form of is used for data may be to data in two different ways to a of between to on a novel of or to use both existing side by when research it is important to what of knowledge and are and in the local culture as as to between knowledge and and management and decisions are often with relationships between information and knowledge and decision-making. These processes involving many political actors and groups which may be either in or from knowledge and synthesis. The influence of scientists on these processes may be limited in some and more in on the system of governance in which they However, the role which scientists in their research can affect the access and opportunity for knowledge holders such as Indigenous and local people to inform decision-making and the nature in which their knowledge is We therefore seek to highlight some of these of informed management and decision-making and their implications for the role of Indigenous and local There are a of approaches to knowledge and information for environmental decision-making within the of applied and social\u2013ecological research Some of these have been to reflect the needs of Indigenous and local people while have from a more natural approach to synthesis.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the connection between earnings management and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We argue that earnings management practices damage the collective interests of stakeholders; hence, managers who manipulate earnings can deal with stakeholder activism and vigilance by resorting to CSR practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a multi\u2010national panel sample of 593 firms from 26 countries between 2002 and 2004, we find a positive impact of earnings management practices on CSR; this relationship holds for different robustness checks. Also, we demonstrate that the combination of earnings management and CSR has a negative impact on financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study draws on a generalized agency theory where managers are seen as the agents of all stakeholders and the earnings management literature to highlight that CSR can be used to garner support from stakeholders and, therefore, provides an opportunity for entrenchment to those managers that manipulate earnings. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the stakeholder perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policy makers and managers interested in enhancing CSR. For managers, our findings suggest that projecting a socially\u2010friendly image in order to disguise earnings management cannot be sustained over time due to the detrimental effect on financial performance. In addition, this study provides a warning signal to policy makers that certain practices geared toward raising a firm's CSR may simply be a mechanism for hindering other devious practices.",

      "abstract": "\u201cContested multilateralism\u201d describes the situation that results from the pursuit of strategies by states, multilateral organizations, and non-state actors to use multilateral institutions, existing or newly created, to challenge the rules, practices, or missions of existing multilateral institutions. It occurs when coalitions dissatisfied with existing institutions combine threats of exit, voice, and the creation of alternative institutions to pursue policies and practices different from those of existing institutions. Contested multilateralism takes two principal forms: regime shifting and competitive regime creation. It can be observed across issue areas. It shapes patterns of international cooperation and discord on key security concerns such as combating terrorist financing, halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and banning certain conventional weapons. It is also evident on economic issues involving intellectual property, on environmental and energy issues, and in the realm of global public health. The sources of dissatisfaction are primarily exogenous, and the institutions used to challenge the status quo range from traditional treaties or intergovernmental organizations to informal networks, some of which include non-state actors. Some institutions are winners from the process of contested multilateralism; others may lose authority or status. Although we do not propose an explanatory theory of contested multilateralism, we do suggest that this concept provides a useful framework for understanding changes in regime complexes and the strategies that generate such changes.

      "abstract": "Objective. To develop and test a multi\u2010item measure for general trust in physicians, in contrast with trust in a specific physician. Data Sources. Random national telephone survey of 502 adult subjects with a regular physician and source of payment. Study Design. Based on a multidimensional conceptual model, a large pool of candidate items was generated, tested, and revised using focus groups, expert reviewers, and pilot testing. The scale was analyzed for its factor structure, internal consistency, construct validity, and other psychometric properties. Principal Findings. The resulting 11\u2010item scale measuring trust in physicians generally is consistent with most aspects of the conceptual model except that it does not include the dimension of confidentiality. This scale has a single\u2010factor structure, good internal consistency (alpha=.89), and good response variability (range=11\u201354; mean=33.5; SD=6.9). This scale is related to satisfaction with care, trust in one's physician, following doctors' recommendations, having no prior disputes with physicians, not having sought second opinions, and not having changed doctors. No association was found with race/ethnicity. While general trust and interpersonal trust are qualitatively similar, they are only moderately correlated with each other and general trust is substantially lower. Conclusions. Emerging research on patients' trust has focused on interpersonal trust in a specific, known physician. Trust in physicians in general is also important and differs significantly from interpersonal physician trust. General physician trust potentially has a strong influence on important behaviors and attitudes, and on the formation of interpersonal physician trust.",

      "abstract": "Soil health, along with water supply, is the most valuable resource for humans, as human life depends on the soil\u2019s generosity. Soil degradation, therefore, poses a threat to food security, as it reduces yield, forces farmers to use more inputs, and may eventually lead to soil abandonment. Unfortunately, the importance of preserving soil health appears to be overlooked by policy makers. In this paper, I first briefly introduce the present situation concerning agricultural production, natural resources, soil degradation, land use and the challenge ahead, to show how these issues are strictly interwoven. Then, I define soil degradation and present a review of its typologies and estimates at a global level. I discuss the importance of preserving soil capital, and its relationship to human civilization and food security. Trends concerning the availability of arable agricultural land, different scenarios, and their limitations, are analyzed and discussed. The possible relation between an increase in a country\u2019s GNP, population and future availability of arable land is also analyzed, using the World Bank\u2019s database. I argue that because of the many sources of uncertainty in the data, and the high risks at stake, a precautionary approach should be adopted when drawing scenarios. The paper ends with a discussion on the key role of preserving soil organic matter, and the need to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. I also argue that both our relation with nature and natural resources and our lifestyle need to be reconsidered.",

      "abstract": "Public perceptions of climate change are known to differ between nations and to have fluctuated over time. Numerous plausible characterizations of these variations, and explanations for them, are to be found in the literature. However, a clear picture has not yet emerged as to the principal trends and patterns that have occurred over the past quarter\u2010century or the factors behind these changes. This systematic review considers previous empirical research that has addressed the temporal aspects to public perceptions. We address findings that have been obtained since the 1980s and using a range of methodologies. In this review, we consider early, seminal work examining public perceptions; survey studies carried out over long timescales and at an international scale; detailed statistical analyses of the drivers of changing perceptions; and qualitative research featuring a longitudinal component. Studies point to growing skepticism in the latter 2000s in some developed countries, underpinned by economic and sociopolitical factors. Even so, in many parts of the world, there has been growing concern about climate change in recent years. We conclude that the imbalance in the literature toward polling data, and toward studies of public perceptions in Western nations (particularly the United States), leaves much unknown about the progression of public understanding of climate change worldwide. More research is required that uses inferential statistical procedures to understand the reasons behind trends in public perceptions. The application of qualitative longitudinal methodologies also offers the potential for better appreciation of the cultural contexts in which climate change perceptions are evolving.

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is Iran's most powerful security and military organisation, responsible for the protection and survival of the regime. Over time, the IRGC has attained a position of dominance vis-\u00e0-vis the regular army (Artesh). In due course, the Guards have also been transformed into a leading political and economic actor. The major political role of the IRGC started with the election of the reformist presidency. However, the Guards' involvement in the Iranian economy began during Rafsanjani's presidency. In view of the importance of Iran and its military, especially the IRGC, this article seeks to analyse the political and economic roles of the IRGC. The article argues that the IRGC's political and economic role is likely to increase due to its unique relationship with Iranian political elites and in view of the current power struggle between various political factions within Iran. However, any such expansion of the IRGC's role may not go unchallenged. The unintended consequence of this could be the erosion of the IRGC's credibility and people's trust. Notes 1.

It was initially devoted to armed struggle against the Shah of Iran. After the 1979 revolution, at first the MEK chose to side with the clerics led by Ayatollah Khomeini against the liberals, nationalists and other moderate forces within the revolution. A power struggle ensued, and by mid-1981 the MEK was fighting street battles against the IRGC. During the Iran-Iraq War, the group was given refuge by Saddam Hussein and they mounted attacks on Iran from within Iraqi territory. See also Frederic Wehrey et al., no. 2. 31.

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to examine the evidence for the hypothesis that the legitimacy of the China's political regime depends mainly on performance (D. Zhao 2009; Zhu 2011). We test the hypothesis using three nationwide public opinion surveys. The first two were conducted as part of the Asian Barometer in 2002 and 2007-8. The third, commissioned by the authors , was completed from November 2012 to January 2013. Two dependent variables are deployed as alternate measures of legitimacy: a composite index of trust in political institutions and agreement with the proposition that Our form of government is still the best for us. The concept of \u201cperformance legitimacy\u201d refers here to that part of legitimacy that can be explained by perceptions of government performance, including management of the national economy. As alternative explanations, we consider: \u201cvalues-based legitimacy\u201d emerging from normative positions on questions concerning social relations and the role of government; and \u201cexposure-acceptance legitimacy\u201d emerging from processes of habituation and indoctrination. We also include controls for respondents\u2019 personal circumstances. We use ordinary least squares and multinomial logistic regressions to test models of regime support. We analyse the relative explanatory power of the four groups of variables corresponding to the hypotheses and controls. We also test for interactive effects between performance and the other groups. We started out sceptical of the notion of \u201cperformance legitimacy\u201d except as part of a composite explanation of regime support. However, we find that whilst composite models have the most explanatory power, performance is the strongest element. The presentation of new data from the 2012-13 survey offers an indication of long-term trends. Political trust is becoming more moderate and support for the political system more variable. The growing importance of political relative to economic performance, as well as the emergence of value cleavages which structure regime support, suggest the regime may become vulnerable to an erosion of support if it fails to carry out reforms aimed at building a kind of political democracy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, urban research has become increasingly concerned with the social, political and economic implications of the techno\u2010political and socio\u2010scientific consensus that the present unsustainable and unjust environmental conditions require a transformation of the way urban life is organized. In the article, I shall argue that the present consensual vision of the urban environment presenting a clear and present danger annuls the properly political moment and contributes to what a number of authors have defined as the emergence and consolidation of a postpolitical and postdemocratic condition. This will be the key theme developed in this contribution. First, I shall attempt to theorize and re\u2010centre the political as a pivotal moment in urban political\u2010ecological processes. Second, I shall argue that the particular staging of the environmental problem and its modes of management signals and helps to consolidate a postpolitical condition, one that evacuates the properly political from the plane of immanence that underpins any political intervention. The consolidation of an urban postpolitical condition runs, so I argue, parallel to the formation of a postdemocratic arrangement that has replaced debate, disagreement and dissensus with a series of technologies of governing that fuse around consensus, agreement, accountancy metrics and technocratic environmental management. In the third part, I maintain that this postpolitical consensual police order revolves decidedly around embracing a populist gesture. However, the disappearance of the political in a postpolitical arrangement leaves all manner of traces that allow for the resurfacing of the properly political. This will be the theme of the final section. I shall conclude that re\u2010centring the political is a necessary condition for tackling questions of urban environmental justice and for creating egalibertarian socio\u2010ecological urban assemblages. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 R\u00e9cemment, la recherche urbaine a montr\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat croissant pour les implications sociales, politiques et \u00e9conomiques du consensus techno\u2010politique et socio\u2010scientifique selon lequel les conditions environnementales actuelles, non viables et injustes, exigent que soit transform\u00e9 le mode d'organisation de la vie urbaine. Or, cette perspective consensuelle de l'environnement urbain soumis \u00e0 un danger manifeste et r\u00e9el annihile le moment v\u00e9ritablement politique et contribue \u00e0 ce que de nombreux auteurs ont d\u00e9fini comme l'apparition et la consolidation d'une situation post\u2010politique et post\u2010d\u00e9mocratique. Traitant ce th\u00e8me essentiel, l'article tente d'abord de conceptualiser et de recentrer le politique en tant que moment critique dans les processus politico\u2010\u00e9cologiques urbains. Ensuite, il montrera que la mise en sc\u00e8ne particuli\u00e8re du probl\u00e8me environnemental et de ses modes de gestion indique, et aide \u00e0 consolider, un \u00e9tat post\u2010politique, dans lequel le v\u00e9ritablement politique est \u00e9vacu\u00e9 du plan de l'immanence sous\u2010jacent \u00e0 toute intervention politique. La consolidation d'une situation post\u2010politique urbaine se fait en parall\u00e8le \u00e0 la formation d'un dispositif post\u2010d\u00e9mocratique qui a remplac\u00e9 d\u00e9bat, d\u00e9saccord et dissension par une panoplie de technologies gouvernementales gravitant autour de mesures de consensus, d'accord et de responsabilit\u00e9, associ\u00e9es \u00e0 une gestion technocratique de l'environnement. Une troisi\u00e8me partie soutient que cet ordre polic\u00e9 consensuel post\u2010politique se rapproche nettement du geste populiste. Toutefois, la disparition du politique d'un dispositif post\u2010politique laisse toutes sortes de traces permettant la r\u00e9\u00e9mergence du v\u00e9ritablement politique. Cet aspect est au c\u0153ur de la derni\u00e8re partie. Pour conclure, le recentrage du politique est un pr\u00e9alable au traitement des questions de justice en mati\u00e8re d'environnement urbain et \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'assemblages urbains socio\u2010\u00e9cologiques d'\u00e9galibert\u00e9.",

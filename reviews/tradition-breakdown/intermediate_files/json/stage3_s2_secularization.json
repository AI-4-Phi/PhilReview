      "abstract": "In various parts of his work, Friedrich Nietzsche directly attacks the German Lutheran tradition, arguing against its anti-modern and anti-Renaissance \u00abascetic ideals\u00bb, which it carried into the heart of modernity, ultimately leading to its decline. Following Nietzsche, Max Weber, in analyzing the processes of modernity\u2019s secularization, highlights the connection between Protestant asceticism, rooted in justification by faith and the concept of Beruf, the birth of Western capitalist individualism, and the bureaucratic mechanics of modern states. Placing these authors\u2019 approaches within the broader debate on secularization and political theology in modernity, this essay aims to focus on the importance of \u201ctechniques of life\u201d and asceticism as instruments for transforming behaviors. It also examines the role that this transformation plays in understanding post-Lutheran modernity, and finally, the theological-political stakes of the current confrontation between the spiritual ecumenism of Christian churches and the governmental nihilism of the globalized \u00abiron cage\u00bb.",

      "abstract": "Modernity is a global condition of an ongoing socio-cultural, economic, and political transformation of human experience, with tradition or religion having no significant role to play. It is the gradual decline of the role of religion in modernity through the implementation of the principles of secularism which has, according to Islamic revivalists, plunged the world into crisis or jahiliyya (unGodliness). Revivalists and sociologists such as Anthony Giddens (1991) call it the \u201ccrisis of modernity\u201d. In response, many Islamic revivalist movements have emerged to address this condition. The Iranian Revolution of 1978\u20131979 gave a boost to many existing Islamic revivalist movements and inspired many to appear anew. The phenomenon of contemporary Islamic revivalism is a religious transformative response to the crisis of modernity\u2014i.e., the inability of secularism and the process of secularization to fulfill the promise of delivering a model of perfect global order. Contemporary Islamic revivalism is not anti-modernity but against secularism and is thus an attempt to steer modernity out of its crisis through a comprehensive and robust process of Islamization\u2014the widespread introduction of Islamic rituals, practices, socio-cultural and economic processes, and institutional developments to the pattern of modern everyday living\u2014and transforming modernity from dar al-harb (abode of war) to dar al-Islam (abode of peace). The paper argues that contemporary Islamic revivalism is a complex heterogeneous global phenomenon seeking to steer modernity out of its prevailing crisis through finding in Islam the universal blueprint of life. It further argues that Islamic revivalism is not anti-modernity but is a religious based reaction against the negative consequences of modernity, particularly against secularism, and carving out a space for itself in modernity.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, North Americans and Western Europeans identify as \u201cspiritual but not religious.\u201d But what does \u201cspirituality\u201d actually mean? And what does this recent \u201cspiritual turn\u201d reveal about the nature of twenty-first-century liberal democracies? Secularization theorists argue that \u201cspirituality\u201d lacks institutional support and a shared tradition, thereby evincing religious decline. Meanwhile, critical commentators contend that the spiritual turn embodies all of the ills of post-1960s liberal democracies. This book challenges these popular misconceptions. Combining cultural sociology with intellectual history and political philosophy, and drawing from first-hand interview and fieldwork data, along with discourse analysis of best-selling books, it shows that rather than reflecting religious decline, the spiritual turn marks the rise of an enduring cultural structure in Western modernity\u2014the religion of the heart. Tracing the rise of the religion of the heart to the 1960s, the book illuminates its elective affinities with the romantic liberal social imaginary that crystallized in popular consciousness during this era, and transformed the institutional spheres of Western liberal democracies, eventually giving birth to a new social order\u2014romantic liberal modernity. Then, inspired by the Durkheimian tradition, it presents case studies of three sites where the religion of the heart is institutionalized in a specific discursive form\u2014a Twelve Step group, a neo-Pentecostal church, and a Toastmasters public speaking club. The book concludes that while critics may have reason to disparage both \u201cspirituality\u201d and romantic liberal modernity more generally, the reality is far more complex than their criticisms suggest\u2014and more importantly, far less hopeless.",

      "abstract": "This article is an attempt to predict the future of Buddhism in relation to the flow of modern religious culture. Modern religious culture is largely discussed through two streams: 'secularization discourse' and 'post-secular or postmodern discourse'. The \u2018discourse on secularization\u2019 developed around the disappearance or decline of religion due to modernization and privatization. \u2018Post-secular or post-modern discourse\u2019 can be said to be a modified or supplementary discourse on the theory of secularization. The focus here is on the reversibility of secularization. The problem of secularization is also important in understanding the status and meaning of modern Buddhism. The so-called \u201cmodern Buddhism,\u201d which has been developed mainly in the West since the 19th century, implies the meaning of \u201cBuddhism with modernity\u201d in its name. This means that traditional Buddhism has been reorganized to a certain extent according to secular conditions in the process of modernization. However, the recent emerging trend of Buddhism complicates the discussion of secularization. The practice of \u2018mindfulness\u2019, which has been developed centering on Western Buddhism, is a representative case. While there is an opinion that this \u2018mindfulness\u2019 meditation is a product of appropriate changes in religiosity following modernization, there is a critical view that it is \u2018secularized Buddhism\u2019 as it is decontextualized from the original Buddhist tradition. In this paper, I would like to examine how the diagnosis and prospects for the present and future of Buddhism are being expressed in this controversy, and to examine the meaning it has in relation to Korean Buddhism.",

This research paper endeavours to identify and analyse the core political concepts and philosophical perspectives expounded by Eliot throughout his poetry, essays, and other literary compositions on contemporary political thought. Key areas of investigation encompasses Eliot\u2019s notion of tradition and its impact on individual character and how it resonates with political institutions and governance, influencing stability and continuity; his critical examination of modern society, rapid industrialization, and urbanization, and its alignment or divergence from other political thinkers of his time; the intersection of Eliot\u2019s religious beliefs, particularly his conversion to Anglicanism, with his political views, moral principles, and notions of governance; his perspectives on authority, power structures, and the role of government, exploring the responsibilities vested in those in positions of power; his scepticism towards democratic governance and preference for an elite ruling class, relevant to contemporary debates on democracy and meritocracy; his writings on nationalism and cosmopolitanism, unveiling his views on balancing national identity and global cooperation; his conservative inclinations and cautious approach towards societal change, with implications for present-day political movements and debates on progress. The study reveals profound insights into tradition, religion, authority, and governance, providing valuable perspectives for contemporary political discourse. Eliot\u2019s works continue to resonate as a thought-provoking and influential force in shaping the understanding of politics in the present day.",

      "abstract": "Anti-intellectualism is rooted in American historical tradition and has gradually become the most prominent social trend in American society. The rise of anti-intellectualism is also the process of changing the role of intellectuals. With the popularity of anti-intellectualism, authority possessed by intellectuals gradually weakened, not only authority over knowledge but also authority in power mechanism, which ultimately led to intellectuals constantly seeking role transformation. From the aspect of anti-intellectualism and role transformation of intellectuals, extreme egalitarianism inherent in anti-intellectualism and populist politics has expelled intellectuals from being legislators. After being legislators, intellectuals transformed into interpreters, but the interpreter was impacted by division among intellectuals and conflict between intellectuals and the public caused by anti-intellectualism. As anti-intellectualism intensified, intellectuals\u2019 chosen role as experts was unable to cope with the overall anti-intellectual atmosphere of society. Based on Saul Bellow\u2019s Ravelstein as a model, this paper will discuss how anti-intellectualism has affected the transformation of the role of intellectuals regarding social phenomena as well as the characters depicted in the novel.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of research interest in the processes of globalization is due to its interdisciplinary nature. The greatest activity of the authors is concentrated in the field of political and economic discourse of globalization. At the same time, assessments of globalization vary up to the opposite, there is no unity of views, and according to the definition of the term \u00abglobalization\u00bb. The solution of the questions, which processes can be understood within the framework of the concept of globalization, and which cannot, is complicated by the conviction of researchers about the paradox of globalization. In the current political and economic discourse, at least two concepts of the \u00abparadox of globalization\u00bb coexist \u2014 John Nesbit and Denis Rodrik. The purpose of this study is to overcome the inconsistency of the research practices of globalization by turning to the cultural-philosophical reflection of the basic, inalienable properties of the European spirit, which took place in the first half of the 19th century. Based on the analysis of the research approaches of critics and supporters of the Enlightenment, G. Hegel, G. von Hardenberg (Novalis), O. Spengler, the article defines the main research positions in the interpretation of the primacy of the European spirit. Using classical philosophical methodology, the analysis of the domestic philosophical reception of these research positions is carried out. As a result of the study, the conclusion is substantiated that there is a theoretical and methodological fairway in understanding the processes of globalization, formed by the European cultural and philosophical tradition. With this approach, the paradoxes of globalization reveal a stable connection and recognizable features with the fundamental positions of the European philosophy of culture, which sees the foundations of European hegemony either in the Christian faith (Novalis) or European rationality (Hegel), which constitutes the main scientific novelty of the study, which has practical significance both for globalism and for the philosophy of culture. Globalistics acquires stable foundations, worked out in the philosophy of culture, the philosophy of culture gets access to a new \u00abuniversal\u201d \u2014 a modern multidirectional world in which cultural processes cannot be isolated from political and economic reality. The idea that the crisis of European civilization, the \u00abdecline of Europe\u00bb is associated either with the loss of faith or with the decline in the role of knowledge, needs further theoretical and methodological elaboration, also updated from the side of the modern political and economic discourse of globalization.",

      "abstract": "In this article the author reveals the changing meaning of the concept of the com\u00admon good in the Renaissance and modern worldviews. In the new conditions of the secularized political community \u2013 the Modern Age nation-state \u2013 the no\u00adtion of the common good could no longer be publicly manifested and legitimi\u00adzed as connected with the Christian idea of salvation; personal participation in the definition of the common good, which was assumed by the republican tra\u00addition of antiquity, turned out to be difficult due to the scale of the modern state. It is shown how in the process of formation of the concept of secular modern state the common good is gradually identified with the state interest (raison d\u2019\u00e9tat). In this connection, a paradox in the development of the idea of the com\u00admon good is noted: being a part of the natural-law tradition, which defended the autonomy of law from the state, it is in the state that it ultimately finds its ex\u00adponent and protector and is opposed to individual rights. The final part of the ar\u00adticle discusses the modern attempt to revive the concept of the common\ngood, undertaken in the post-liberal neo-Thomist concept of \u201cconstitutionalism of the common good\u201d, as well as the broad polemics around it. The author con\u00adcludes that the failure of this attempt is due to the fact that the Thomist concept of the common good is removed from the theocentric picture of the world and placed in the context of the modern secular state, which, however, highlights with particular acuteness the problem of how the common good as a common cause is possible in the conditions of a non-homogeneous society.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the evolution of the phenomenon of nihilism in Western European philosophical and anthropological thought. It notes the ambiguous nature of the course and formation of a new non-classical discourse in the philosophy of the twentieth century, its influence on the formation of modern philosophical trends of modernity, which was a natural phenomenon against the background of ideological hunger in Europe, a kind of spiritual impasse. Despite the fact that nihilism has been clearly manifested only since the second half of the XIX century, signs of the decline of spiritual values are now again being observed in modern Europe, the search for a new formula for the development of European society against the background of the crisis of globalization processes around the world. In addition, the article also indirectly touches upon the issue of reception of cultural and philosophical ideas of the East, without which nihilism as a philosophical doctrine is impossible. It is noted that the modern era with its tragic metamorphoses stems from the aggravation of philosophical and anthropological problems of modernity, leading to the manifestation of nihilism in its various forms. The interest in nihilism is due to the logic and history of human development, especially in the XXI century, when international relations based on the concepts of law and morality are breaking down; when the states themselves, sometimes consciously, take the shaky path of state nihilism with all the resulting inhumane and catastrophic consequences of their actions, conditioning their policy on the ideology of protecting national interests. Of course, the movement towards nihilism is natural in its own way, because modernity requires different approaches and methodologies for solving both urgent global and local problems. In addition, nihilism reflects the dialectic of being, the formation of the new and the change of the old, and like any process of transformation, it is painful and sometimes catastrophic. Therefore, the modern world order system needs to rethink and search for a new humanistic paradigm, cultural and philosophical rapprochement and interaction. Thus, it is quite justifiable to assert the existence of legal, moral, political, metaphysical, ontological, methodological, psychological, mereological aspects of nihilism, which originate from the philosophical and axiological foundations of the subject. Nevertheless, the article does not aim to reveal this multifaceted concept in its various variations, due to the complexity of understanding nihilism in the context of historical, economic, political, economic, social, cultural and other foundations of existence, although it indicates the existence of such a connection.",

      "abstract": "Salafism, derived from the root of \u2018Salaf\u2019 in the sense of \u2018the former\u2019 as a word, means \u2018the path of those who follow the footsteps of the former\u2019 and refers to a kind of religious fanaticism or conservatism. Salafism, which expresses a strict and literal adherence to Islamic tenets and a return to the pure origins of religion in the Islamic tradition, is today used as a synonym for religious radicalism in fields such as Islamic Sciences, Political Science, and International Relations. With its traditional form; Salafism, which establishes itself through a stance against religious rationality and being pro-interpretation, represents a \u2018return to the essence\u2019 reaction against intra-religion pluralism and secularism. The Salafi paradigm, which advocates a return to the essence of religion, is also skeptical of the intellectual and artistic achievements and products of the Muslim civilization, and in this respect it represents an anti-cultural attitude. The damage done by the Salafist activist groups to the Islamic civilization and other cultures is concrete examples of this. This study concentrates on the causes that lead to the Salafist flare in modern times. The study analyzes which religious and social concerns it represents in the face of social change, modernization, and secularization. It examines the relationship between Salafism and Sunnism and highlights the misleading aspects of approaches that try to show it outside of Sunnism. Approaching the subject with an interdisciplinary approach, the study includes analyzes on the intersection of theology, political science, and international relations. \nConceptual analyzes of Salafism reveal the pre-Islamic roots of this concept. In fact, the need to attribute a past essence and manage the present, which is common in every society, appears in the Arabs as 'following the way of the ancestors'. Sanctifying the past breeds suspicion of innovations and differences. 'Islamic essentialism', represented by Salafism, advocates constancy against change, essentialism against pluralism, nass against reason, and following over apostasy. Since it adopts a strict dogmatic (nass) and literal attitude in religious matters, it considers theology, philosophy and Sufism to be a departure from religion. As for the imagination of history, it embraces the idea of deterioration, separation from the essence and decay. \nIn modern age, the Islamic world has faced a multifaceted crisis and collapse. Problems that started in the political field have expanded into the field of identity and values. Concerns about protecting identity, essence and faith have nourished Salafism as a radical conservatism. \nIn the Islamic world, where crises continue to increase, Salafism attracts attention as a type of thought, belief, lifestyle and action. However, instead of producing a livable alternative, it represents a reactive stance and advocates a minimal and harsh religious life. Otherwise its harsh approach towards culture and art expresses a nihilistic view towards Islamic civilization. There is a confusion regarding Salafism in the Sunni world. This confusion is historically and theologically related to the adoption of Salafism by Sunnism. However, the growing new Salafism rejects the elements that make up the existing Sunni identity. This is an ironic situation for Sunnism. The theological tension between Sunnism, based on the knowledge of theology, f\u0131qh and Sufism, and strict nass-based Salafism continues.",

Since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, there has no longer been only one form of Christianity: a choice has to be made between Protestantism and Catholicism. But more important is the development, from the eighteenth century onward, of what is commonly called secularization. The term actually refers to two different phenomena, which may or may not coincide. The first form of secularization is based on a legal and constitutional concept: the autonomy of the political sphere, leading either to the separation of the state from religious institutions, or to the political takeover of the religious sphere. The second form of secularization is sociological in nature: it denotes the decline in religious observance and the disappearance of religion as the focus of social and cultural life. This is what is called dechristianization in Europe. However, the decline in religious practice across Europe does not necessarily make references to religious identity irrelevant. That people no longer believe in God does not mean society is no longer Christian in its values, such as respect for human dignity, and its institutions.",

      "abstract": "is true that religion has ideologically essentialized itself through history; however, this does not mean that it has a de facto existing essence. The historical demystification of the human understanding of the world, the gradual decrease of religion in the public sphere and the privatization of religious beliefs characterize our modern secular age. However, the assumed linear progression of religion\u2019s decline has been challenged by a resurgence of religion and belief in both western and non-western societies, especially in the latter where religion is entangled with questions of the authority of knowledge and culture. This proves that the secularization thesis of religion\u2019s inexorable decline cannot remain unquestioned. We must explain the continuous development of religion in modern life. What are the theoretical frameworks that explain the Abstract: To critique the traditional thesis of secularization, which prioritizes secularism over religion, I shall refer to both Charles Taylor and Talal Assad\u2019s significant contributions to secularization studies. Taylor\u2019s proposition examines the historical narrative of secularity and provides an in-depth philosophical understanding of secularization theory. He justifies the reemergence of religion by the fact that religion does not disappear but rather it adapts itself to the secular age. However, Assad adopts an anthropological approach that seeks to disclose the contradictions of secular modernity and liberal democratic states. Assad is more interested in the formation of the secular as an epistemic category than secularization as a historical process or secularism as a political doctrine. His main concern is to problematize the concept of the secular through a genealogical method that seeks to consider different sensibilities and practices like the myth, the sacred and pain in the formation of the secular. These striking examples provide helpful materials in the construction of the secular from other non-secular or religious practices. They also prove that there has been always a relationship between religion and the secular. Therefore, I argue that the concept of the secular cannot be analyzed in isolation from the religious, nor can it be universally identified as a totality. My intention here is to underscore the idea that any rigid division between religion and the secular or any attempt to put them in sequential, linear or dichotomous positions will only impoverish both. I argue also that the more secularism identifies itself with reason and supposedly Eurocentric universal attributes the more religion reinforces its \u2018essence\u2019 against secularism. Religion\u2019s reactive response to secularism is simply the outcome of secularism\u2019s alliance with reason and science.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The creation of the state of Israel was the outcome of the Zionist movement, which originated in Europe and was itself inspired by fundamental European ideas\u2014Enlightenment, national self-determination, democracy and socialism. From its earliest days Zionism was primarily a secular movement that rejected the religious establishment and religious way of life of the Jews in the Diaspora. In many respects, however, the founders of the state and the principles on which they founded its institutions\u2014the political, judicial, economic, social, and educational\u2014were rooted in the ethical values and cultural practices of the Jewish tradition which they had apparently rejected. To explain this complex process of secularization of a very ancient religious and cultural tradition\u2014which many see as an unresolved or unresolvable conflict between two opposing systems of thought\u2014I draw on the hermeneutic philosophy of Hans-Georg Gadamer and especially on his Truth and Method (1960). Culture, according to Gadamer, is a continuous flow of tradition within what he called \u201cthe horizon.\u201d People, he argued, create and live within a given cultural tradition, but they are at the same time its interpreters, enlarging it by adopting elements from various cultures and ideologies, or \u201chorizons.\u201d From this hermeneutic perspective, the founders of modern Israel and their successors were the active interpreters of the Jewish tradition within the larger historical context of the European Enlightenment. I illustrate this process of cultural interpretation by focusing on the secularization of the Jewish holidays, specifically on the way the Kibbutz movement, a leading symbol of the new Israel, re-interpretated Jewish holidays like Passover, Shavuot (Pentecost) and Yom Kippur, and gave these religious festivals a secular-Israeli content. However, this dynamic pioneering stage of secularization may be said to have ended by the 1980s. From then on, the secular identity of Israeli society has been undergoing a variety of radical changes.",

      "abstract": "The 1824 Constitution combines elements of permanence and rupture with the Old Regime, by introducing the right to religious freedom and maintaining the confessional model characterized by placet and patronage. Throughout the 19th century, the gradual and ambiguous advance of the secularization process, understood as the reduction of religion to the private field, led to a political crisis accentuated by the Religious Question (1872). This text aims to relate Joaquim Nabuco's perceptions about secularization with the decline of the confessional model and, to this end, considers the author's ideas about the relationship between the Church and the State in the period between 1873 and 1880. Nabuco's view on the subject is in line with the perspective of the liberal radicals of the 1870s who disputed with royalists, ultramontanes, and moderate radicals about the role that religion would play in Brazilian public life. These different positions of the political spectrum are projected into discordant interpretations of the maintenance of the confessional regime and its relationship with constitutional rights and freedoms. The research found the statesman's perception of the need for autonomy in Brazilian public life in relation to religion, which implied reducing the political reach of the Church, breaking with the model adopted by the Constitution of 1824. It is concluded that the thinking of Nabuco on secularization can be framed within what the statesman called Politics with a capital p, as he realizes that the separation of Church and State was inevitable for Brazil to progress.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the dynamic interplay between theological and secular paradigms in shaping contemporary political movements and social justice discourse, with a particular focus on the Culture War surrounding reproductive rights and gender identity. It examines the historical transition from the Judeo\u2013Christian tradition to modern secular frameworks, highlighting how core theological concepts\u2014such as imago Dei, the sanctity of life, and divine sovereignty\u2014have been reinterpreted and secularized. In the context of an increasingly secular world and the resurgence of religion in a post-secular society, the article leverages Eric Voegelin\u2019s philosophical framework to deepen the dialogue on the Culture War and secularization. The analysis argues that modern social justice movements and ideology can be seen as immanentizing the eschaton and moral order, where transcendent values are reconfigured as temporal, political, and cultural constructs for ultimate justice and redemption. By tracing modern concepts of social justice back to their theological roots, this article aims to enrich debates on secularization and the ideological divisions fueling the Culture War, fostering pathways toward a more cohesive and less polarized political landscape.",

She writes, on the other hand, in and over the decline of modern nation-states that expel and denationalize both foreign citizens and their own depending on the case. She also thinks as a Jew from birth who suffers persecutions and particularly theorizes on her Jew condition and the future of Judaism before and after the creation of the State of Israel. As we will see during this paper we can identify these three issues all together, particularly in the Zionist experience: modern secularization, decline of the nation-state and the \u201cJewish question\u201d. And it is from these intertwined elements that we can draw a critical thinking for a politics of pluralism.",

      "abstract": "The discourse of Islam in modern Western political philosophy is constructed in the horizon of \"evidence\" and solutions, the clarification of the origin and essence of which is the task of philosophical interpretation. The article analyzes three representative examples: the in-terpretation of the \"ideology of Islam\" in relation to the global liberal economic order (D. Lal); \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d as a kind of ressentiment (S. Zizek); \u201cIslamic fundamentalism\u201d in the hori-zon of the \u201cglobal empire\u201d (M. Hardt, A. Negri). It is established that the conceptual framework of all three discourses of Islam is the dominant Western \"economic paradigm\" (J. Agamben) of political philosophy. The liberal new European form of the latter makes a fundamental distinc-tion between the public and the private, making room for free civic identities based on the arbi-trary individual choice of an autonomous subject and homogenizing social reality into ideal ab-solute anarchy. This is possible only on the basis of the tradition of secularization, which is im-manent in the West and alien to Islam. With regard to any \u201cother\u201d, strategies of assimilation or destruction are applied. The conclusion is made about the unsuitability of liberal \u201cinstruments\u201d for the establishment and maintenance of peace through the policy of separation and multicul-turalism; theoretically possible alternatives to the \u201cnotion of the political\u201d are indicated",

The study distinguishes\nbetween the realistic and the Real in literature, drawing on Valery Podoroga\u2019s\nworks on the realistic tradition as a national-political myth.\nThe second part of the article analyzes the phenomenon of somnambulism through\nthe theoretical constructs of Merab Mamardashvili, Andrea Cavalletti, and Giorgio\nAgamben, which helps to clarify the grounds for considering Vienna as the capital\nof the 20th century. Special attention is paid to the mechanisms of memory and\noblivion that shape modernity, as well as to the phenomenon of personality doubling\ncharacteristic of the turn of the 19th\u201320th centuries. In conclusion, the author suggests\nviewing representatives of decadent art as \u201cagents of falling,\u201d through whom\nforgotten evidences manifest themselves, and decadence itself as a possibility of a\nspecial kind of awakening.

      "abstract": "The proposed article offers an interpretation of the essay \u201cTwo Ukrainian Patriots\u201d (1930) by the prominent Ukrainian cultural figure Borys Homzyn, which constitutes a little-studied part of his creative legacy. The research focuses on exploring the thinker\u2019s historiosophical concept and the ethical formula of national unity he proposed. Following the views of Mykhailo Drahomanov, Borys Homzyn regarded \u00abIstoriia Rusiv\u00bb not merely as a historical work, but as a fundamental political monument of the late 18th century, created by Hryhoriy Poletyka, a representative of the Left-Bank nobility. In this treatise, he saw a manifesto defending Cossack liberties and the autonomist tradition, which opposed imperial despotism. Amid the decline of the Hetmanate, literature was forced to assume the succession of the political ideas of \u00abIstoriia Rusiv\u00bb, becoming a means of preserving national identity. The author substantiated that Borys Homzyn assessed the influence of \u00abIstoriia Rusiv\u00bb on Taras Shevchenko as direct and crucial for the formation of historical and national motifs in the poet\u2019s work. Particular attention in the article is focused on the comprehension of the ethical formula for national unity proposed by the essay\u2019s author. The thinker asserted that the profound rift within the Ukrainian elite could only be overcome on a moral and spiritual basis. He identified self-sacrificing love for Ukraine as the unifying factor, one that places the supra-national ideal above estate-based egoism, as evidenced by the ideological kinship between the author of \u00abIstoriia Rusiv\u00bb and the author of \u00abKobzar\u00bb. Thus, Borys Homzyn\u2019s historiosophy contains a cordocentric concept of the moral grandeur of the patriotic deed, which serves as a fundamental principle for the national consolidation of Ukrainians.",

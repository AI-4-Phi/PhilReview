## Section 1: The Nature of Traditions and Structural Vulnerabilities

Understanding how traditions break down requires first grasping what traditions are and what structural features make them vulnerable to failure. The major philosophical accounts of tradition that emerged in the twentieth century converge on one crucial point: traditions are not static inheritances passively received but dynamic processes requiring active appropriation through practices, narratives, and authoritative transmission. This dynamism, however, is precisely what makes traditions fragile. Each major theoretical framework identifies distinct structural vulnerabilities—points at which the active work of tradition maintenance can fail, precipitating breakdown.

### 1.1 Practice-Based and Hermeneutic Accounts

The most influential contemporary account of tradition emerges from Alasdair MacIntyre's practice-based framework. In *After Virtue*, MacIntyre (1981) argues that traditions are best understood as "arguments extended through time," embedded in social practices that possess internal goods, standards of excellence, and narrative continuity. A practice—whether medicine, farming, or political deliberation—carries within it accumulated wisdom about how to pursue goods internal to that activity. Traditions are the historical extensions of such practices, sustaining and developing the standards by which excellence is judged. This framework reveals a fundamental vulnerability: traditions depend not merely on the transmission of content but on the active engagement of practitioners who must master inherited standards while extending inquiry into new problems. When practices corrupt—when external goods like money or status displace internal goods, when standards of excellence erode, or when communities fail to sustain conditions enabling practice-participation—traditions lose their rational foundation.

MacIntyre's (1988) concept of "epistemological crisis" provides the most developed philosophical account of tradition failure. Such crises occur when a tradition's conceptual resources prove inadequate to make intelligible what practitioners encounter—when problems arise that existing frameworks cannot solve. Healthy traditions respond to epistemological crises through narrative reconstruction that explains both the inadequate conceptual scheme and why it failed. But traditions can also collapse when they prove incapable of such reconstruction, when internal resources cannot generate adequate responses to the challenges they face. As D'Andrea (2006) explicates, this framework shows how traditions can be both historically particular and rationally progressive through internal critique—but also how they can fail by their own standards when that internal critique becomes impossible.

Lutz (2014) draws out the implications: traditions are fundamentally fragile, not robust. Their survival requires continuous re-appropriation by practitioners who actively inquire rather than passively receive. This fragility operates at multiple levels: traditions require practice-integrity (internal goods must remain central), virtue-cultivation (practitioners must develop excellences), and institutional support (social structures must enable participation). The failure of any element can precipitate breakdown.

Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic account offers a complementary perspective. In *Truth and Method*, Gadamer (1960) rehabilitates tradition as the enabling medium of understanding rather than an obstacle to truth. Understanding always occurs through "prejudices" (Vorurteile)—pre-judgments shaped by effective history that constitute our interpretive horizons. Against the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice," Gadamer argues that tradition-shaped pre-understandings make interpretation possible rather than distorting it. Traditions are not objects to be grasped by detached reason but the medium within which understanding occurs.

This hermeneutic framework identifies a different vulnerability. Traditions function when prejudices remain open to dialogical revision—when the "fusion of horizons" enables transformation through encounter with other perspectives. Breakdown occurs when prejudices ossify into dogmas resistant to dialogue, when traditions become closed systems unable to engage productively with challenges. Alexander (2016) captures the tension between these accounts: MacIntyre emphasizes rational inquiry within traditions while Gadamer emphasizes interpretation and dialogue. But both agree that traditions require active engagement rather than passive inheritance. The static tradition is already dying.

### 1.2 Authority, Legitimacy, and Institutional Carriers

If practice-based and hermeneutic accounts explain what traditions are, the question remains: through what mechanisms are they sustained and transmitted? Here the concepts of authority and institutional carriers become essential.

Hannah Arendt's (1961) foundational analysis identifies authority as distinct from both power (the capacity to act in concert) and violence (coercion through force). Authority, she argues, was historically rooted in the Roman trinity of tradition, religion, and authority—a configuration in which the founding of Rome sanctified political arrangements that were then transmitted through generations as authoritative inheritance. The modern age severed this trinity, producing a permanent "crisis of authority." What is lost is not merely specific forms of authority but the very concept itself: the binding force that made traditions authoritative rather than merely customary. Crucially, Arendt argues that authority cannot be restored once its foundations collapse—it cannot be manufactured through rational reconstruction or enforced through violence.

This analysis reveals a mutual dependence between tradition and authority that explains why their breakdown is mutually reinforcing. Traditions require authority for transmission: without authoritative teachers, institutions, and exemplars, traditions cannot be passed to new generations as binding rather than merely optional. But authority equally depends on tradition for its legitimacy: authority derives its binding force from connection to a sanctified past, not from present rational justification or coercive capacity. When either element weakens, the other necessarily suffers. The erosion of authority makes traditions appear as mere customs to be discarded; the breakdown of traditions leaves would-be authorities without grounds for their claims.

Edward Shils (1981) provides the sociological grounding for these philosophical claims. Traditions require institutional carriers—churches, universities, guilds, families—that structure intergenerational transmission. They require authority structures that designate who may authoritatively interpret and transmit traditional content. And they require mechanisms of apprenticeship through which tacit knowledge passes from practitioners to novices. Shils emphasizes that all societies require traditions to function; even revolutionary movements create new traditions while claiming to break with the past. But this necessity does not guarantee success. Transmission mechanisms can fail, institutions can decay, and authority structures can dissolve.

Michael Polanyi's (1958) epistemology illuminates a particular vulnerability in transmission. Much traditional knowledge is tacit—skills, judgments, and understandings that cannot be fully articulated or codified in explicit rules. Such knowledge is learned through apprenticeship relations, through dwelling with masters who embody competencies they cannot fully explain. When apprenticeship relations dissolve—when explicit codification is mistaken for genuine transmission, when communities of practice fragment—tacit knowledge is irretrievably lost. This is not mere forgetting; it is the destruction of knowledge that existed only in embodied practice.

Empirical research documents how these theoretical vulnerabilities manifest concretely. Dalton (2005) demonstrates that declining political trust is spreading across advanced industrial democracies, with the greatest declines occurring among educated elites—precisely those who might authoritatively transmit traditions. This pattern suggests the crisis is not merely one of institutional performance failure but of the grounds for authority itself. Seligson (2002) shows how corruption erodes institutional legitimacy, destroying not just trust in particular institutions but the interpersonal trust networks on which tradition transmission depends. Greene (2017) clarifies the distinctive character of traditional authority in Weber's typology: it operates through belief in "the sanctity of age-old rules and powers," a form of legitimacy that modernization's rationalization systematically undermines.

The structural vulnerabilities identified across these accounts can now be synthesized. Traditions fail through: (a) epistemological crisis—when conceptual resources prove inadequate to resolve problems; (b) ossification—when interpretive frameworks close off dialogical revision; (c) practice corruption—when external goods displace internal goods and standards erode; (d) authority erosion—when the binding force connecting tradition to sanctified founding dissolves; and (e) transmission failure—when institutional carriers decay and apprenticeship relations collapse. These vulnerabilities operate independently but often compound: external pressures precipitate internal crises, while internal weakness invites external disruption. Understanding tradition breakdown requires attending to all these dimensions and their interactions.

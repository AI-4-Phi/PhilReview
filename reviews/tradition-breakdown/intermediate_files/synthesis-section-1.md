## Introduction

Political and cultural traditions are not merely inherited customs awaiting passive reception; they are dynamic frameworks that structure rationality, ground authority, and enable social coordination. When traditions break down, more is lost than particular practices or beliefs. As MacIntyre (1981) argues, traditions constitute the very contexts within which virtues can be understood and pursued; without them, moral discourse fragments into the incommensurable positions characteristic of modern emotivism. Gadamer (1960) goes further, positioning tradition not as an object to be grasped by detached reason but as the medium within which understanding itself occurs. Our prejudices—the pre-judgments shaped by tradition—are not obstacles to knowledge but its enabling conditions. When traditions collapse, we lose not just their content but the interpretive horizons that make meaning possible.

The question of how and why traditions break down has received surprisingly fragmented treatment in political philosophy. Philosophical accounts of tradition focus predominantly on its positive functions: MacIntyre (1988) develops tradition-constituted rationality and the concept of epistemological crisis; Gadamer (1960) rehabilitates prejudice and authority as sources of understanding; Oakeshott (1962) defends practical knowledge against rationalist encroachment. Yet these accounts theorize tradition maintenance more than tradition failure. Sociological treatments of modernization describe external pressures—rationalization, disenchantment, individualism—without systematically engaging the philosophical frameworks that explain what traditions are and why their loss matters. Historical case studies document specific collapses without providing generalizable mechanisms. What is lacking is systematic integration of these perspectives into a unified account of tradition failure.

This fragmentation is puzzling given what is at stake. Arendt (1961) identifies a mutually constitutive relationship between tradition and authority: traditions require authority for transmission, while authority depends on tradition for legitimacy. The rupture of this nexus in modernity produced not merely the loss of particular traditions but a permanent "crisis of authority" that no rational reconstruction can repair. If Arendt is right, understanding tradition breakdown is essential for grasping the distinctively modern political predicament. Hobsbawm (2012) adds a further complication: when organic traditions break down, invented traditions proliferate—recent constructions claiming ancient origins that serve social cohesion or institutional legitimation but lack the accumulated practical wisdom and adaptive flexibility of genuine traditions. Understanding why organic traditions fail is thus inseparable from understanding why their manufactured replacements prove inadequate.

This review synthesizes philosophical theories of tradition with accounts of internal breakdown mechanisms, external pressures, authority erosion, and the dynamics of invented traditions to identify patterns in tradition failure. The review proceeds from conceptual foundations—what traditions are and what makes them structurally vulnerable—through mechanisms of breakdown, both internal (epistemological crisis, ossification, practice corruption) and external (rationalist reform, modernization, colonial destruction). It concludes by critically assessing existing frameworks and identifying gaps that warrant further research. Throughout, the analysis emphasizes that traditions are fragile achievements requiring continuous active appropriation, not inert inheritances passively received. Their breakdown is not mere change but the dissolution of conditions that make certain forms of meaning, authority, and social coordination possible.

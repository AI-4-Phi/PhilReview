## Mechanisms of Tradition Breakdown

Traditions fail through distinct but interacting pathways. Some mechanisms are endogenous, arising from tensions within traditions themselves; others are exogenous, imposed by external forces that disrupt traditional practices or delegitimate traditional authority. Understanding how these mechanisms operate—and how they interact—is essential for diagnosing when traditions are undergoing productive transformation versus terminal decline.

### Internal Mechanisms: Epistemological Crisis, Ossification, and Practice Corruption

The most theoretically developed account of internal tradition failure comes from MacIntyre's concept of epistemological crisis. A tradition enters such a crisis when its conceptual resources cannot make intelligible what practitioners encounter—when anomalies accumulate that the tradition's established methods cannot explain (MacIntyre 1977). Resolution requires creating a new narrative that explains both the old inadequate scheme and why it failed, thereby making the crisis itself intelligible. Traditions that successfully navigate such crises emerge strengthened; those that cannot either fragment into competing schools or ossify into unreflective dogma.

MacIntyre's analysis in Three Rival Versions (1990) demonstrates how traditions can collapse through internal incoherence. The Enlightenment encyclopedist project—claiming to provide neutral, systematic knowledge transcending particular traditions—failed precisely because it could not acknowledge its own tradition-dependence. This internal contradiction proved fatal: a tradition that denies being a tradition cannot coherently justify its own standards. Herdt (1998) presses this point further, arguing that MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality itself faces a self-reference problem: if all rationality is tradition-bound, then the criteria for judging one tradition superior to another must themselves be tradition-relative, potentially undermining any claim to rational superiority.

Beyond epistemological crisis lies ossification—the hardening of living traditions into dead conventions. Angier (2014) argues that living traditions are characterized by ongoing internal debate about their own standards and purposes; when such argument ceases and conformity is enforced, traditions lose their adaptive capacity. This distinction between vitality and stagnation provides criteria for diagnosis: traditions degenerate not when they change but when they become too rigid to permit the internal contestation that enables adaptation.

The epistemological crisis framework has been applied to contemporary cases with mixed results. Petersen (2020) argues that Marxian economics has been defeated as a tradition of inquiry, unable to account for its systematic predictive failures or to resolve internal contradictions between theoretical commitments and empirical evidence. More dramatically, Lukic (2023) applies MacIntyre's framework to the Yugoslav narrative, showing how citizens lost the ability to make their own actions intelligible when moving between pre-Yugoslav, Yugoslav, and post-Yugoslav contexts. When a political tradition's narrative framework collapses, it ceases providing the conceptual resources people need to understand their roles and purposes—producing mass existential disorientation.

### External Pressures: Rationalism, Modernization, and Colonial Destruction

While internal mechanisms reveal how traditions defeat themselves, external pressures show how traditions can be destroyed from without. Oakeshott's (1962) critique of "rationalism in politics" identifies a primary mechanism: the attempt to replace practical knowledge—embedded in traditions and learned through participation—with explicit technical rules derived from abstract theory. Rationalists mistake ideological abstraction for genuine understanding, destroying irreplaceable practical wisdom in the name of reform.

Scott (2017) extends this analysis to state-driven modernization projects, showing how "high modernism"—the belief that scientific-technical knowledge can reshape society for the better—produces disasters when combined with authoritarian power. Soviet collectivization, Tanzanian villagization, and scientific forestry all imposed simplified, legible schemas that overrode local practical knowledge (what Scott calls "metis"). The result was not merely inefficiency but the destruction of traditional practices that had sustained communities for generations. Scott identifies four conditions for such disasters: administrative ordering of society, high-modernist ideology, authoritarian state power, and a civil society too weak to resist.

Secularization and disenchantment represent subtler but equally pervasive external pressures. Taylor's A Secular Age (2007) traces how modernization transforms the "conditions of belief" from a world where tradition was taken for granted to one where both belief and unbelief become contested options within an "immanent frame." Crucially, Taylor's earlier Sources of the Self (1990) shows how the internalization of moral sources—relocating them from external traditional frameworks to within the individual—transforms tradition from constitutive framework to external constraint. When moral authority shifts inward, traditions lose their taken-for-granted status and must justify themselves before the tribunal of individual conscience.

Colonial destruction represents the most violent form of external pressure. Whyte (2019) demonstrates that colonialism operates not merely through ideological delegitimation but through physical containment—preventing the exercise of traditional practices. Indigenous mobility traditions, based on fluid relationships with environment and seasonal migration, were destroyed by colonial policies that fixed populations in place. Even when traditional knowledge was retained, colonial containment made its practice impossible, severing the link between knowing and doing that traditions require. Conrad (2012) challenges Eurocentric frameworks by showing how Enlightenment narratives of rationalization and disenchantment themselves functioned as instruments of tradition destruction, declaring non-Western practices "backward" or "irrational" to legitimate colonial intervention.

### Invented Traditions and Authenticity

Hobsbawm's (2012) influential framework distinguishes "invented traditions"—recent constructions claiming ancient origins—from organic traditions that evolved through genuine historical continuity. Invented traditions proliferate precisely when older traditions break down, serving to establish social cohesion, legitimize institutions, or inculcate values through repetition that claims continuity with the past. Crucially, invented traditions are typically more rigid than organic ones: because they lack embedded social practices and genuine historical roots, they cannot adapt flexibly to changing circumstances.

Ranger's (2012) analysis of colonial Africa reveals how invented traditions can be weaponized for social control. Colonial administrators created "customary law" systems and tribal identities that froze African societies in an imagined traditional past while reserving modernity for Europeans. These invented traditions were more rigid and ahistorical than either European or genuine pre-colonial African practices, precisely because they served political rather than social functions. When traditions are fabricated for domination rather than emerging from lived practice, they shatter under pressure rather than evolving.

Yet the organic/invented distinction faces significant challenges. Alexander (2016) argues that all traditions involve both transmission from the past and active construction in the present, making sharp authenticity distinctions untenable. What matters is not whether a tradition is historically authentic but whether it successfully embeds itself in meaningful practices. Bogumil (2018) reinforces this point through analysis of the Russian Orthodox Church's canonization of Soviet-era "New Martyrs"—an obviously constructed tradition that has nonetheless proven remarkably resilient because it aligns with powerful institutional interests.

Abizadeh (2014) identifies a distinctive vulnerability of invented traditions in liberal democratic contexts: their dependence on myths that cannot withstand critical examination. Liberal democracies are committed to norms of publicity, free inquiry, and rational justification that will eventually expose fabricated origins. This creates structural instability: the very institutional commitments that characterize liberal democracy undermine the mythological foundations that nationalist traditions require. Vorontsov (2023) notes a deeper conceptual confusion: different theorists assign contradictory meanings to "tradition" (flexible versus rigid, rational versus pre-rational), making claims about tradition breakdown systematically ambiguous.

### Conservative and Communitarian Diagnoses

Conservative and communitarian thinkers offer distinctive diagnoses of how liberal modernity undermines tradition. MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981) traces moral fragmentation to the Enlightenment's abandonment of Aristotelian teleology: without a shared conception of human purposes, moral discourse becomes incoherent, producing emotivism—the reduction of moral claims to expressions of preference—and incommensurability between competing positions. Liberal individualism severs the connections between practices, narrative, and tradition that virtue requires.

Taylor's Ethics of Authenticity (1991) shows how a genuine tradition—Romantic authenticity—degenerates through internal corruption rather than external destruction. Authenticity, originally meaning truthfulness to horizons of significance beyond the self, devolved into shallow self-fulfillment disconnected from any larger framework of meaning. The vocabulary persists while the substance erodes: people invoke "authenticity" while practicing mere self-gratification. This demonstrates that traditions can decay while retaining their surface forms—a corruption more insidious than outright destruction.

Sandel (1982) diagnoses liberal neutrality itself as tradition-eroding. Procedural liberalism's conception of an "unencumbered self" prior to communal attachments conceptually severs the ties that make tradition possible. If selves are not constituted by their communities but merely choose associations, then traditions appear as external constraints on freedom rather than sources of identity. Liberal neutrality among conceptions of the good, far from protecting traditions, evacuates public discourse of the substantive moral content that traditions provide. Scruton (1980) emphasizes that traditions depend on pre-rational allegiances and embodied practices that abstract liberalism cannot recognize—let alone protect.

Yet these diagnoses face critical challenges. Bourke (2018) argues that "conservatism" as a unified tradition is itself a twentieth-century construction: Burke was a reformist Whig, not the founder of a conservative tradition. If conservative thinkers lack a shared tradition of their own, their diagnoses of tradition breakdown may be less unified than presented. This meta-level critique suggests that laments about tradition loss may themselves be part of an invented tradition serving contemporary political purposes.

The interaction between internal and external mechanisms is crucial. External pressures often precipitate internal crises: colonial destruction may trigger epistemological breakdown, while rationalist reform may expose internal contradictions that traditions had previously accommodated. Conversely, internal weakness invites external disruption: traditions already suffering practice corruption or authority erosion are more vulnerable to modernizing pressures. Understanding tradition breakdown requires attention to both pathways and their compounding effects.

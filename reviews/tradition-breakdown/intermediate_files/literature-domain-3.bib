====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how external forces—modernization, rationalism,
secularization, technology, globalization, and colonialism—disrupt or destroy
traditions from outside. The literature reveals three major theoretical
frameworks: (1) Weber's rationalization thesis, arguing that modern
instrumental reason systematically displaces traditional meaning structures
through bureaucratization and disenchantment; (2) Oakeshott's critique of
rationalism in politics, showing how abstract rationalist schemes override
practical, tradition-embedded knowledge; and (3) Scott's analysis of "high
modernism," demonstrating how state simplification projects destroy local
practical knowledge and traditional practices. Recent work extends these
frameworks to analyze secularization (Taylor), globalization and indigenous
displacement (Whyte), and colonialism's destruction of non-Western traditions
(Kelley). The domain shows that external pressures operate through multiple
mechanisms: epistemic (delegitimating traditional knowledge), institutional
(state intervention), technological (disrupting traditional practices),
economic (market rationalization), and cultural (Western universalism).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential analysis of exogenous causes of tradition
breakdown, complementing internal mechanisms. It connects directly to the
project's focus on how traditions fail when subjected to modernizing pressures
that delegitimate their authority, disrupt their transmission mechanisms, or
physically destroy their institutional bases. The rationalism critique is
particularly relevant for understanding how abstract theorizing undermines
practical tradition-based knowledge.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Literature on technology's specific disruption mechanisms remains scattered.
The interaction between multiple external pressures (e.g., how colonialism
and modernization reinforce each other) needs more systematic treatment.
Post-communist tradition reconstruction after external disruption is
under-explored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around distinct disruption mechanisms rather than chronologically.
Contrast rationalist/modernist disruption (Oakeshott, Scott) with more
structural accounts (Weber's rationalization). Note tension between critiques
of modernization and normative defenses of certain modernizing pressures
(e.g., against oppressive traditions).

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Weberian rationalization: 6 papers - Disenchantment through instrumental reason
- Rationalism critique: 4 papers - Abstract planning vs. practical knowledge (Oakeshott, Scott, Hayek)
- Secularization thesis: 4 papers - Religious tradition decline through secular modernity
- Colonialism/imperialism: 4 papers - External destruction of non-Western traditions

@book{taylor2007secular,
  author = {Taylor, Charles},
  title = {A Secular Age},
  year = {2007},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  doi = {10.5040/9780567672803.ch-007},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor argues that Western modernity is defined not by the
  disappearance of religion but by a shift in the "conditions of belief"—from
  a world where belief in God was unproblematic to one where both belief and
  unbelief are contested options within an "immanent frame." Secularization is
  understood as disenchantment (loss of transcendent meaning embedded in the
  world) and the "disembedding" of individuals from traditional religious and
  social frameworks. Taylor traces this transformation through the Reformation,
  Enlightenment, and Romantic periods, showing how the disciplinary project of
  reform inadvertently created conditions for exclusive humanism and radical
  secularity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how modernization pressures—particularly
  secularization and rationalization—create conditions where tradition loses its
  taken-for-granted status. Taylor's analysis of "disembedding" directly addresses
  how individuals are extracted from traditional contexts of meaning. His concept
  of the immanent frame illuminates how modern thought structures make
  transcendent sources of authority (including traditions) contestable. The work
  shows that external pressure need not destroy tradition overtly but can
  transform the epistemic conditions under which tradition must justify itself.

  POSITION: Weberian disenchantment framework, but emphasizes cultural-spiritual
  transformation rather than institutional rationalization. Critical of both
  subtraction narratives (secularization as simple loss of religion) and pure
  nostalgia for pre-modern enchantment.

@book{scott2017seeing,
  author = {Scott, James C.},
  title = {Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed},
  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Yale University Press},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctvxkn7ds},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scott argues that large-scale authoritarian state planning
  projects systematically fail because they impose simplified, legible schemas
  that override local practical knowledge ("metis"). High-modernist ideology—the
  belief that scientific-technical knowledge can reshape society for the
  better—combined with authoritarian state power produces disasters when it
  ignores the complex, context-dependent knowledge embedded in local practices
  and traditions. Scott analyzes Soviet collectivization, Tanzanian villagization,
  and scientific forestry as cases where state simplification destroyed
  functioning traditional systems. The book identifies four conditions for such
  disasters: administrative ordering, high-modernist ideology, authoritarian
  power, and a prostrate civil society unable to resist.

  RELEVANCE: Provides detailed analysis of how state-driven modernization
  projects destroy traditions by delegitimating and replacing local practical
  knowledge with centralized rational planning. Directly relevant to understanding
  tradition breakdown through external imposition of abstract rationalist schemes.
  Scott's concept of metis captures what Oakeshott calls "practical knowledge"—the
  kind of knowledge traditions embody and transmit. Shows mechanism by which
  modernization physically destroys traditional practices while claiming to improve
  human welfare.

  POSITION: Anarchist-influenced critique of state rationalism; sympathetic to
  local, traditional knowledge against centralizing modernization. Aligns with
  Oakeshott's rationalism critique but provides concrete historical cases.

@article{conrad2012enlightenment,
  author = {Conrad, Sebastian},
  title = {Enlightenment in Global History: A Historiographical Critique},
  journal = {The American Historical Review},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {117},
  number = {4},
  pages = {999--1027},
  doi = {10.1093/ahr/117.4.999},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conrad challenges Eurocentric narratives that treat the
  Enlightenment as a uniquely European phenomenon that then "spread" to the
  rest of the world through modernization. He argues that Enlightenment ideas
  emerged through global interactions and colonial encounters, not autonomous
  European development. The Weberian narrative of Western rationalization and
  disenchantment as distinctive to Europe misrepresents historical reality and
  serves to legitimate Western cultural imperialism. Conrad proposes replacing
  diffusion narratives with accounts of mutual constitution and entanglement.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how modernization narratives themselves
  function as instruments of tradition destruction in non-Western contexts.
  Challenges the assumption that rationalization and disenchantment are
  universally valid frameworks rather than parochial Western categories imposed
  globally. Illuminates how intellectual history of modernization theory reflects
  and reinforces colonial power relations that destroyed non-Western traditions
  by declaring them "backward" or "irrational."

  POSITION: Postcolonial critique of Weberian modernization theory; challenges
  both classical secularization thesis and its contemporary defenders. Emphasizes
  global entanglement over unidirectional Western influence.

@article{whyte2019indigenous,
  author = {Whyte, Kyle and Talley, Jared L. and Gibson, Julia D.},
  title = {Indigenous Mobility Traditions, Colonialism, and the Anthropocene},
  journal = {Mobilities},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {14},
  number = {3},
  pages = {319--335},
  doi = {10.1080/17450101.2019.1611015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Whyte et al. argue that indigenous peoples have ancient
  traditions of environmental mobility, migration, and resettlement based on
  fluid, transformative relationships. Colonialism operates as a containment
  strategy that curtails indigenous mobility, disrupting these traditions by
  fixing populations in place and destroying adaptive capacity. The contemporary
  climate crisis and discussions of climate-induced resettlement must be
  understood in the context of ongoing colonial containment, not as genuinely
  "new" challenges. The authors analyze Gulf Coast and Alaskan cases to show
  how colonial restrictions on mobility compound climate vulnerability.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates concrete mechanism by which colonialism destroys
  traditions—not just through ideological delegitimation but through physical
  containment and prevention of traditional practices. Illuminates how external
  pressures (colonialism, state policy) can destroy traditions by making their
  exercise impossible, even when the knowledge is retained. Connects to broader
  theme of how modernization projects disrupt traditional adaptive strategies,
  leaving communities vulnerable to environmental change.

  POSITION: Indigenous environmental philosophy; explicitly anti-colonial.
  Emphasizes traditions as active adaptive systems rather than static heritage.
  Challenges presentist narratives that ignore colonial historical context.

@article{liu2025disenchantment,
  author = {Liu, Chang},
  title = {Disenchantment and the Democratic Charisma: Revisiting Weber's Diagnosis of Modernity},
  journal = {Communications in Humanities Research},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.54254/2753-7064/2025.ne29310},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Liu examines whether Weber's proposed solution to modernity's
  disenchantment—democratic charisma generated through elections—can genuinely
  heal the spiritual deficit created by rationalization. Drawing on critiques
  by Storm (enchantment never fully vanished) and Marotta (demagification vs.
  disenchantment), Liu argues that democratic charisma remains structurally
  frail because it is embedded in the same legal-rational procedures that
  produce disenchantment. Electoral spectacles and populist appeals offer only
  transient simulations of meaning that are easily routinized or manipulated.

  RELEVANCE: Recent analysis (2025) of Weber's rationalization thesis and its
  implications for tradition and meaning in modernity. Relevant for understanding
  limits of procedural solutions to tradition breakdown—shows how formal
  democratic procedures cannot restore the embedded meaning that traditional
  structures provided. Illuminates tension between efficient governance (requiring
  rationalization) and authentic collective belief (requiring tradition or
  charisma).

  POSITION: Neo-Weberian critique; skeptical of democratic proceduralism as
  response to disenchantment. Emphasizes structural contradictions in modern
  attempts to generate meaning through rationalized institutions.

@book{taylor1990sources,
  author = {Taylor, Charles},
  title = {Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity},
  year = {1990},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  doi = {10.2307/2072870},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor provides a genealogy of modern identity, tracing how
  contemporary notions of selfhood, inwardness, and authenticity emerged through
  transformations in moral frameworks from Plato through Romanticism. He argues
  that modern identity is shaped by three major cultural shifts: internalization
  of moral sources, affirmation of ordinary life, and expressivist turn toward
  authenticity. These shifts create distinctively modern moral horizons but also
  generate characteristic pathologies including instrumental reason's dominance
  and loss of transcendent frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational work on how modernization transforms the self's
  relationship to tradition and moral authority. Shows how shift from external
  traditional sources to internal authenticity undermines traditions' authority
  by relocating moral sources within the individual. The internalization Taylor
  describes creates structural conditions where tradition appears as external
  imposition rather than constitutive framework. Links directly to tradition
  breakdown through transformation of moral epistemology.

  POSITION: Communitarian-influenced but not anti-modern; seeks to recover
  moral sources compatible with modernity. Critical of procedural liberalism
  but not nostalgic for pre-modern frameworks.

  journal = {Religions},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {14},
  number = {1},
  doi = {10.3390/rel14010015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ali argues that Islamic revivalism responds to modernity's
  crisis—secularism's failure to deliver promised perfect global order—not to
  modernity itself. Revivalist movements seek to steer modernity out of crisis
  through Islamization: introducing Islamic rituals, practices, and institutions
  into modern life to transform modernity from dar al-harb (abode of war) to
  dar al-Islam (abode of peace). Contemporary Islamic revivalism is not
  anti-modern but religiously based reaction against secularism's negative
  consequences and systematic violence inherent in secular modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Shows complex relationship between tradition and modernity—not
  simple rejection but attempted synthesis. Relevant for understanding how
  tradition breakdown through secularization can generate revivalist responses
  that seek to reconstruct tradition within modernity rather than restore
  pre-modern forms. Challenges simplistic secularization narratives where
  tradition inevitably declines. Illuminates how external modernizing pressures
  can trigger defensive traditionalism.

  POSITION: Sympathetic to Islamic revivalism; critical of secular modernity's
  violence and exclusions. Rejects both anti-modern traditionalism and complete
  Westernization.

  journal = {The Oxford Handbook of Classics in Contemporary Political Theory},
  year = {2015},
  doi = {10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198717133.013.35},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: King analyzes Scott's Seeing Like a State as grounded political
  theory that rediscovers skeptical themes from counter-enlightenment, anarchist,
  libertarian, and postcolonial thought through rich empirical evidence. While
  Scott's core thesis—that state simplification schemes destroy local practical
  knowledge—resonates with long-standing critiques of coercive power and rational
  planning, his work's value lies in demonstrating these abstract arguments
  through concrete historical cases. King defends Scott as political theory
  against charges of merely restating familiar skepticism, emphasizing
  methodological and substantive lessons for political theory.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical analysis of Scott's contribution to
  understanding state-driven tradition destruction. Explicitly connects Scott's
  work to broader tradition of rationalism critique (Burke, Oakeshott, Hayek),
  positioning his analysis within political philosophy's skeptical tradition.
  Useful for synthesis work connecting different strands of anti-rationalist
  thought and showing how they illuminate tradition breakdown mechanisms.

  POSITION: Sympathetic defense of Scott as political theorist; acknowledges
  anarchist and libertarian influences while distinguishing Scott's empirical
  grounding from abstract theory.

  journal = {American Quarterly},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {69},
  number = {2},
  pages = {267--276},
  doi = {10.1353/aq.2017.0020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kelley challenges Patrick Wolfe's settler colonial studies
  framework for inadequately addressing African colonization and racial capitalism.
  He argues that Wolfe's distinction—indigenous people are colonized for land
  (logic of elimination), Africans for labor (not primarily land-based
  colonization)—erases African indigeneity and obscures how settler colonialism
  operated globally. Drawing on Cedric Robinson's Black Radical Tradition, Kelley
  shows how racial regimes are historically contingent and how capitalism itself
  is racially structured. By not incorporating African and European history more
  fully, settler colonial theory delimits more than it reveals.

  RELEVANCE: Critiques and extends settler colonial studies, relevant for
  understanding how colonialism destroyed non-European traditions through
  multiple mechanisms (elimination, enslavement, cultural destruction). Shows
  that tradition destruction through external imperial force takes different
  forms depending on colonial context. Challenges frameworks that inadvertently
  reproduce colonial categories by treating only certain peoples as indigenous
  and therefore tradition-bearing. Important for avoiding Eurocentric frameworks
  when analyzing tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Black radical tradition; explicitly critical of whiteness and racial
  capitalism. Challenges both classical Marxism and some settler colonial theory
  for inadequately theorizing race and African experience.

  journal = {Max Weber Studies},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {17},
  number = {1},
  pages = {24--47},
  doi = {10.15543/MWS/2017/1/4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schluchter distinguishes Weber's concept of disenchantment
  from standard secularization theses, showing Weber's usage encompasses both
  religious and scientific disenchantment in dialectical relationship. He
  compares Weber's framework with Charles Taylor's A Secular Age, noting both
  convergences and divergences. Weber attributed broader meaning to disenchantment
  by distinguishing types and showing their historical interaction with
  reenchantment processes. Both authors conclude that even in secular age religion
  persists but religious commitment becomes optional, fundamentally changing
  religious situation in modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies Weber's disenchantment thesis and its relationship to
  tradition breakdown through rationalization. Shows disenchantment operates
  dialectically—religious rationalization (Protestant Reformation) enabled
  scientific rationalization which then undermined religious tradition. Important
  for understanding how tradition breakdown can be inadvertently caused by
  tradition-internal reform movements (connects to internal breakdown mechanisms).
  Illuminates philosophical foundations of secularization theory.

  POSITION: Neo-Weberian; emphasizes complexity and dialectics of rationalization
  against simplistic secularization narratives. Synthesizes Weber and Taylor.

  title = {The Conservative of the Spontaneous Order},
  journal = {Journal of Libertarian Studies},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.35297/001c.118570},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Benzecry argues that libertarians should intellectually oppose
  current Western cultural developments (influenced by critical theory and
  deconstruction) due to their constructivist nature, which threatens the
  spontaneous order. Drawing on Hayek's critique of constructivism, he contends
  that these cultural shifts pose two threats: (1) they challenge traditional
  libertarian views of civil society's spontaneous origins, attempting to reshape
  it toward a specific postmodern worldview; (2) it remains uncertain how a
  libertarian society would function under a newly constructed social order that
  does not value free speech, property rights, and other liberal principles.

  RELEVANCE: Recent (2024) application of Hayek's constructivism critique to
  contemporary cultural change, showing continuity of rationalism critique into
  present. Relevant for understanding how tradition breakdown through deliberate
  reconstruction threatens spontaneous order theorists value. Illustrates tension
  between defending traditional liberal order and avoiding reactionary cultural
  politics. Shows how external pressure of "constructivist" cultural movements
  can threaten evolved traditional institutions.

  POSITION: Hayekian libertarianism; culturally conservative regarding
  spontaneous order. Opposes both state intervention and cultural constructivism.

  number = {3},
  pages = {545--566},
  doi = {10.1177/14748851231177171},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Piccolo argues that recent efforts to "decolonize critical
  theory" by Amy Allen and Robert Nichols fail to consider two key elements'
  relationship with Indigenous thought: (1) all normativity is generated
  immanently from historically/socially located struggle; (2) normativity is
  negatively defined. Drawing on diverse Indigenous scholars, he shows that
  nature is generally a relevant normative category in Indigenous thinking in
  ways irreducible to historical location, and that right action involves
  substantive positive visions of living well, not merely resisting colonialism.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates fundamental incompatibility between certain Western
  philosophical frameworks (including ostensibly critical ones) and Indigenous
  traditions. Shows how even well-intentioned Western theories can perpetuate
  tradition destruction by imposing categories (purely negative normativity,
  historical constructivism) that are alien to Indigenous thought. Relevant for
  understanding epistemic violence as mode of tradition breakdown—not just
  physical destruction but conceptual frameworks that make tradition unintelligible
  or irrational.

  POSITION: Indigenous philosophy perspective; critical of both liberal and
  critical theory frameworks for inadequately engaging Indigenous thought on
  its own terms.

  year = {2023},
  volume = {30},
  number = {1},
  doi = {10.12726/tjp.30.1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: George and Muhammed analyze Taylor's genealogy of modern
  identity in Sources of the Self, emphasizing how assertion of modern individual
  spawned erroneous self-understanding characterized by loss of horizon. Taylor,
  inspired by Heidegger's Dasein analysis, argues that self is not neutral or
  atomic but exists only in terms of questions and constitutive concerns. The
  modern turn inward relocates moral sources within the individual, creating
  conditions where external frameworks (including traditions) appear as
  constraints rather than constitutive elements of selfhood.

  RELEVANCE: Recent (2023) interpretation of Taylor's core argument about modern
  identity's relationship to tradition and communal frameworks. Useful for
  understanding how modernization's transformation of selfhood creates structural
  conditions for tradition breakdown—not through overt destruction but through
  reconceptualizing the self-tradition relationship. Shows how liberal
  individualism's limitations create conditions where tradition cannot be
  understood as constitutive of identity.

  POSITION: Communitarian interpretation of Taylor; emphasizes Heideggerian
  influences. Critical of liberal individualism's atomistic self-conception.

  volume = {53},
  number = {4},
  pages = {492--497},
  doi = {10.1086/714548},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Çubukçu argues that Scott is not sufficiently anarchist in
  Seeing Like a State and that his desire for "true" science bears the stamp
  of high modernism he criticizes. She questions whether Scott distinguishes
  liberal from authoritarian states adequately, noting he refuses to indict the
  state as such. Scott's claim that "certain kinds of states" are threats to
  well-being leaves open that other state forms could be legitimate, a position
  anarchists would reject. The article challenges Scott's epistemic framework
  for potentially reproducing imperial knowledge claims.

  RELEVANCE: Important critique of Scott's rationalism critique, showing how
  even anti-rationalist frameworks can reproduce problematic epistemic claims.
  Relevant for understanding limits of spontaneous order/local knowledge arguments—
  they may still privilege certain forms of knowing over others. Illuminates
  tensions in defending tradition against modernization while avoiding relativism
  or conservatism that preserves oppressive traditional practices.

  POSITION: Anarchist critique of Scott; more radical rejection of state power

  year = {2012},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674060.003.0003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Harrison examines the narrative that science is a main driver
  of secularization by generating challenges to core religious beliefs. He
  analyzes how this "conflict thesis" operates as historical narrative rather
  than empirical description, tracing its construction and function in modernity.
  Harrison argues that narratives of secularization often serve ideological
  purposes, legitimating certain forms of modernity while delegitimating
  tradition and religion as backward or unscientific.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant for understanding how secularization narratives themselves
  function as instruments of tradition breakdown—not just describing neutral
  historical processes but actively constructing frameworks that position
  tradition as incompatible with modernity and science. Shows meta-level at
  which external pressure operates: through construction of historical narratives
  that make tradition appear obsolete. Important for critical analysis of
  modernization theory itself as ideology.

  pages = {39--56},
  doi = {10.1080/13537903.2019.1585102},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Watts uses Taylor's concept of modernity's malaise to analyze
  how Canadian millennials who identify as "spiritual but not religious"
  experience addiction as manifestation of free-market capitalism's inability
  to provide overarching meaning. Addiction becomes the means by which these
  individuals experience disenchantment, leading them to seek alternative good
  life understandings they equate with "spirituality." Interest in spirituality
  should be understood as personalized attempt to re-enchant an experienced-as-
  disenchanted world.

  RELEVANCE: Contemporary empirical application of Taylor's disenchantment
  thesis, showing how modernity's destruction of traditional meaning frameworks
  manifests in individual lives. Relevant for understanding consequences of
  tradition breakdown for meaning-making and well-being. Illustrates how
  external pressure (market rationalization) creates spiritual crisis that

  doi = {10.1353/rvm.2024.a929312},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Van Beeck critiques Taylor's A Secular Age framework of
  disenchantment-reenchantment, arguing it describes an intellectual scheme
  rather than historical reality. She challenges applying these terms to
  epoch-defining sociocultural constellations, noting awkward ideological
  implications of such periodization. Drawing on Ricoeur, she argues that loss
  and recovery of enchantment occur primarily at the individual life level
  through dynamic between individual and "call of reality" rather than at
  civilizational level.

  RELEVANCE: Recent (2024) fundamental critique of disenchantment narrative
  that underpins much literature on tradition breakdown through modernization.
  Important for questioning whether "external pressures" framework itself rests
  on mistaken civilizational narratives. Suggests need for more careful attention
  to individual-level dynamics rather than sweeping claims about modernity
  destroying tradition. Challenges whether disenchantment adequately describes
  mechanism of tradition breakdown.

  pages = {173--181},
  doi = {10.13060/00380288.2001.37.12.06},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hann analyzes Ernest Gellner's theory of nationalism, which
  relies on holistic concept of culture despite Gellner's philosophical rejection
  of Wittgensteinian relativism and anthropological prioritization of structure-
  function over cultural "costume." Hann argues this culture concept derives
  from Herderian counter-Enlightenment and has surprising affinity with Clifford
  Geertz's interpretivism. Hann contends such holistic notions of "a culture"
  are anthropologically unconvincing, increasingly unrealistic sociologically,
  and anti-liberal politically.

  RELEVANCE: Critique of Gellner's nationalism theory relevant for understanding
  how modernization (specifically industrialization requiring cultural
  homogenization) destroys pre-modern cultural particularism. Shows tensions in
  theories linking modernization to tradition breakdown—they often rely on
  problematic culture concepts. Relevant for understanding how nationalist
  modernization projects can themselves destroy local traditions while claiming
  to preserve national culture. Illuminates political stakes of different
  theorizations of culture and tradition.

  POSITION: Critical of Gellnerian nationalism theory; liberal skepticism toward
  holistic culture concepts. Emphasizes anthropological rather than philosophical
  approach to culture.

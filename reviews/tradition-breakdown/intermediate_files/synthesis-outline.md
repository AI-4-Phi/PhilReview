## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the research question within existing scholarship on tradition in political philosophy, establish what is at stake in understanding tradition breakdown, and preview the review's analytical structure.

**Content**:
- Political and cultural traditions are not merely inherited practices but constitutive frameworks that structure rationality, identity, and political legitimacy. When traditions break down, more is lost than particular customs—the very conditions for meaning, authority, and social coordination may be disrupted.
- The research question "how and why do traditions break down?" has received surprisingly fragmented treatment. Philosophical accounts of tradition (MacIntyre, Gadamer, Oakeshott) focus on tradition's positive functions; sociological accounts of modernization (Weber, Taylor) describe external pressures; historical case studies document specific collapses. What is lacking is systematic integration of these perspectives into a unified account of tradition failure.
- This review synthesizes philosophical theories of tradition with accounts of internal breakdown mechanisms, external pressures, authority erosion, invented traditions, conservative/communitarian diagnoses, and empirical case studies to identify patterns and gaps in understanding tradition failure.
- Structure preview: The review proceeds from conceptual foundations (what traditions are and what makes them vulnerable) through mechanisms of breakdown (internal and external) to critical assessment of existing frameworks and identification of research gaps.

**Key Papers**: MacIntyre 1981 (foundational practice-based account), Gadamer 1960 (hermeneutic tradition theory), Oakeshott 1962 (practical knowledge defense), Arendt 1961 (authority-tradition nexus), Hobsbawm 2012 (invented tradition critique)

## Section 1: The Nature of Traditions and Structural Vulnerabilities

**Section Purpose**: Establish the conceptual framework for understanding what traditions are and identify the structural features that make them vulnerable to breakdown. This provides the analytical vocabulary for subsequent sections on mechanisms of failure.

**Main Claims**:
1. Traditions are not static inheritances but dynamic processes requiring active appropriation through practices, narratives, and authoritative transmission.
2. Each major philosophical account of tradition (practice-based, hermeneutic, conservative-practical, sociological) identifies distinct structural vulnerabilities: corruption of practices, ossification of prejudices, loss of tacit knowledge, failure of transmission mechanisms.
3. The authority-tradition nexus (Arendt) suggests that tradition breakdown and authority crisis are mutually reinforcing: traditions require authority for transmission, while authority depends on tradition for legitimacy.

### Subsection 1.1: Practice-Based and Hermeneutic Accounts

**Papers**: MacIntyre 1981, MacIntyre 1988, Gadamer 1960, Lutz 2014, Alexander 2016 (Three Rival Views), D'Andrea 2006

**Content**:
- MacIntyre's account: traditions as "arguments extended through time" embedded in practices with internal goods, standards, and narrative continuity. Traditions progress through engaging "epistemological crises" when conceptual resources prove inadequate.
- Gadamer's hermeneutic account: tradition as the medium of understanding through "prejudices" (pre-judgments) and effective history. Traditions enable understanding but must remain open to dialogical revision.
- Key tension: MacIntyre emphasizes rational inquiry within traditions; Gadamer emphasizes interpretation and dialogue. Both agree traditions are not static but require active engagement.
- Vulnerabilities identified: MacIntyre's framework reveals traditions can fail through epistemological crisis they cannot resolve; Gadamer's suggests failure when prejudices ossify into dogmas resistant to dialogue.
- Lutz (2014) on tradition as "fragile practice": traditions depend on practice-integrity, virtue-cultivation, and institutional support—all vulnerable to corruption.

**Gap Connection**: These accounts explain tradition maintenance but provide limited explicit analysis of breakdown mechanisms. MacIntyre's epistemological crisis offers the most developed account but focuses on intellectual traditions rather than political-cultural ones.

### Subsection 1.2: Authority, Legitimacy, and Institutional Carriers

**Papers**: Arendt 1961, Shils 1981, Polanyi 1958, Greene 2017, Dalton 2005, Seligson 2002

**Content**:
- Arendt's foundational analysis: authority as distinct from power and violence, rooted in the Roman trinity of tradition, religion, and authority. Modernity severed this connection, producing a permanent "crisis of authority."
- Shils's sociological grounding: traditions require institutional carriers, authority structures, and mechanisms of intergenerational transmission. All societies need traditions; even revolutionary movements create new ones.
- Polanyi on tacit knowledge: tradition transmits knowledge that cannot be fully articulated, learned through apprenticeship. When apprenticeship relations dissolve, tacit knowledge is lost.
- Weber's traditional authority: legitimacy based on "the sanctity of age-old rules and powers" operates differently from legal-rational authority. Modernization's rationalization undermines this distinct legitimacy type.
- Empirical evidence: Dalton (2005) and Seligson (2002) document declining institutional trust across democracies, with erosion concentrated among educated elites—precisely those who might transmit traditions.

**Gap Connection**: Arendt's claim that authority cannot be restored once its foundations collapse raises critical questions: Is tradition breakdown irreversible? Can new traditions be successfully founded?

**Section Summary**: Traditions are dynamic processes requiring active appropriation, authoritative transmission, and institutional carriers. Their structural vulnerabilities include: (a) inability to resolve epistemological crises, (b) ossification of interpretive frameworks, (c) corruption of constitutive practices, (d) erosion of authority structures, and (e) failure of transmission mechanisms. These vulnerabilities operate independently but often compound.

## Section 2: Mechanisms of Tradition Breakdown

**Section Purpose**: Analyze the specific mechanisms by which traditions fail, distinguishing internal breakdown (traditions defeating themselves) from external pressures (forces destroying traditions from without), while recognizing their interaction.

**Main Claims**:
1. Internal breakdown occurs primarily through epistemological crisis (conceptual inadequacy), practice corruption (loss of internal goods), and ossification (rigidity preventing adaptation).
2. External pressures include rationalist reform (Oakeshott), high-modernist state projects (Scott), secularization and disenchantment (Weber, Taylor), and colonial destruction.
3. Invented traditions exhibit distinctive vulnerabilities: lacking embedded social practices, they depend on continued political utility and are susceptible to delegitimation when their fabricated nature is exposed.
4. The interaction between internal and external factors is crucial: external pressures often precipitate internal crises, while internal weakness makes traditions vulnerable to external disruption.

### Subsection 2.1: Internal Mechanisms: Epistemological Crisis, Ossification, and Practice Corruption

**Papers**: MacIntyre 1977, MacIntyre 1990, Herdt 1998, Angier 2014, Lukic 2023, Petersen 2020

**Content**:
- MacIntyre's epistemological crisis (1977): occurs when a tradition's conceptual scheme cannot make intelligible what practitioners encounter. Resolution requires narrative reconstruction explaining both the inadequate scheme and why it failed.
- Three Rival Versions (1990): demonstrates how traditions can be internally incoherent—Enlightenment encyclopedism's claim to neutral systematicity collapsed because it could not acknowledge its own tradition-dependence.
- Herdt (1998) on self-reference problems: if all rationality is tradition-constituted, traditions claiming rational superiority over rivals may be covertly appealing to tradition-transcendent standards, creating internal contradiction.
- Angier (2014) on ossification vs. vitality: living traditions are characterized by ongoing internal debate about standards and purposes; ossification occurs when argument ceases and conformity is enforced.
- Contemporary applications: Petersen (2020) applies MacIntyre's framework to Marxian economics as a failed tradition unable to resolve its internal contradictions. Lukic (2023) on Yugoslav narrative collapse shows political consequences of intelligibility crisis.

**Gap Connection**: The epistemological crisis framework is primarily applied to intellectual traditions. How it applies to political traditions without clear propositional content (e.g., republican institutions, democratic norms) remains underdeveloped.

### Subsection 2.2: External Pressures: Rationalism, Modernization, and Colonial Destruction

**Papers**: Oakeshott 1962, Scott 2017, Taylor 2007, Taylor 1990, Whyte 2019, Conrad 2012

**Content**:
- Oakeshott's critique of rationalism: "rationalism in politics" attempts to replace practical knowledge with explicit technical rules. Rationalists mistake ideological abstraction for genuine understanding, destroying irreplaceable practical wisdom.
- Scott's high modernism: state simplification projects (Soviet collectivization, scientific forestry) impose legible schemas that override local practical knowledge (metis). Four conditions for disaster: administrative ordering, high-modernist ideology, authoritarian power, prostrate civil society.
- Taylor on disenchantment and disembedding: A Secular Age (2007) traces how modernization transforms "conditions of belief" from taken-for-granted tradition to contestable option. Sources of the Self (1990) shows how internalization of moral sources relocates tradition from constitutive framework to external constraint.
- Colonial destruction: Whyte (2019) demonstrates how colonialism destroys traditions through containment—not just ideological delegitimation but physical prevention of traditional practices (indigenous mobility).
- Critical perspective: Conrad (2012) challenges Eurocentric modernization narratives, showing how frameworks of rationalization and disenchantment can themselves function as instruments of tradition destruction.

**Gap Connection**: The interaction between epistemic delegitimation (traditions declared "irrational") and material destruction (institutions dismantled) needs more systematic treatment. How do these mechanisms reinforce each other?

### Subsection 2.3: Invented Traditions and Authenticity

**Papers**: Hobsbawm 2012, Ranger 2012, Abizadeh 2014, Alexander 2016 (Systematic Theory), Bogumil 2018, Vorontsov 2023

**Content**:
- Hobsbawm's framework: invented traditions claim ancient origins but are recent constructions serving social cohesion, institutional legitimation, or value inculcation. They proliferate when genuine traditions break down.
- Ranger on colonial Africa: invented traditions are often more rigid than organic ones, lacking the flexibility to adapt. Colonial "customary law" froze African societies in imagined traditional past while reserving modernity for Europeans.
- Vulnerability thesis: Abizadeh (2014) argues invented traditions in liberal democracies are structurally unstable because liberal commitments to free inquiry and rational justification will expose their fabricated nature.
- Challenge to organic/invented dichotomy: Alexander (2016) argues all traditions involve construction and reconstruction, making sharp authenticity distinctions untenable. What matters is whether traditions successfully embed in meaningful practices, not their historical authenticity.
- Vorontsov (2023) on conceptual confusion: different theorists assign contradictory meanings to "tradition" (flexible vs. rigid, rational vs. pre-rational), producing systematic ambiguity in claims about tradition breakdown.

**Gap Connection**: The normative distinction between acceptable "reconstruction" (Eisenstadt) and problematic "invention" remains philosophically underdeveloped. When does creative adaptation become illegitimate fabrication?

### Subsection 2.4: Conservative and Communitarian Diagnoses

**Papers**: MacIntyre 1981, Taylor 1989, Taylor 1991, Sandel 1982, Scruton 1980, Bourke 2018

**Content**:
- MacIntyre's diagnosis: Enlightenment abandonment of Aristotelian teleology fragmented moral tradition, producing emotivism (moral claims as mere expressions of preference) and incommensurability between moral positions.
- Taylor on authenticity's degeneration: The Ethics of Authenticity (1991) shows how a genuine modern ideal (Romantic authenticity) has devolved into shallow self-fulfillment disconnected from "horizons of significance." Internal tradition decay without external destruction.
- Sandel's critique of liberal atomism: procedural liberalism's conception of the "unencumbered self" prior to communal attachments conceptually severs the ties that make tradition possible. Liberal neutrality erodes constitutive communities.
- Scruton on organic tradition: traditions depend on pre-rational allegiances and embodied practices that abstract liberalism cannot recognize. Rationalist reform destroys the delicate balance of accumulated wisdom.
- Critical counterpoint: Bourke (2018) argues "conservatism" as a unified tradition is itself a twentieth-century construction. If conservative thinkers lack a shared tradition, their diagnoses of tradition breakdown may be less unified than presented.

**Gap Connection**: Conservative/communitarian diagnoses focus on Western liberal modernity. How these frameworks apply to non-Western contexts, or to conservative traditions that are themselves oppressive, remains underexplored.

**Section Summary**: Tradition breakdown proceeds through multiple interconnected mechanisms: epistemological crisis and internal contradiction, ossification and loss of adaptive capacity, practice corruption, rationalist assault on practical knowledge, high-modernist state simplification, secularization and disembedding, colonial destruction, and the inherent fragility of invented traditions. These mechanisms rarely operate in isolation; external pressures precipitate internal crises, while internal weakness invites external disruption.

## Section 3: Research Gaps and Critical Assessment

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate what is missing in the literature and critically assess the adequacy of existing frameworks for understanding tradition breakdown.

**Gap 1: Limited Integration Across Theoretical Frameworks**

- **Evidence**: Philosophical accounts of tradition (MacIntyre, Gadamer, Oakeshott) rarely engage systematically with empirical historical cases. Empirical studies of democratic breakdown, revolution, and regime collapse (Skocpol 1979, Somer 2019, Weimar literature) rarely draw on philosophical tradition theory. The domains proceed in parallel without mutual enrichment.
- **Why it matters**: Without integration, we lack a unified vocabulary for diagnosing tradition failure across contexts. Philosophical frameworks identify structural vulnerabilities; historical cases reveal how these vulnerabilities are exploited. Neither alone provides adequate understanding.
- **How research might address it**: Systematic application of MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework or Arendt's authority-tradition analysis to concrete historical cases of political tradition breakdown. Comparative analysis testing whether different theoretical frameworks illuminate different case types.
- **Supporting literature**: Alexander 2016 (comparing Arendt, Oakeshott, MacIntyre) begins this integration; Lukic 2023 applies MacIntyre to Yugoslavia; but sustained cross-domain synthesis remains rare.

**Gap 2: Under-Theorized Distinction Between Adaptation and Destruction**

- **Evidence**: All accounts acknowledge traditions must change to survive. MacIntyre's epistemological crisis can lead to productive reconstruction or collapse. Hobsbawm's invented traditions may successfully embed in social practice or remain superficial. But criteria for distinguishing healthy adaptation from destructive breakdown are vague.
- **Why it matters**: Without clear criteria, we cannot diagnose when traditions are undergoing productive transformation versus terminal decline. This is crucial for political philosophy: when should institutions be reformed within tradition, when is tradition itself the problem?
- **How research might address it**: Development of criteria distinguishing (a) successful epistemological crisis resolution from tradition collapse, (b) legitimate reconstruction from illegitimate fabrication, (c) adaptive evolution from corrosive erosion. Such criteria would need both philosophical grounding and empirical testing.
- **Supporting literature**: Angier (2014) on living vs. dead traditions gestures toward this; Obidina (2022) on Eisenstadt's transformation vs. Hobsbawm's invention; but systematic criteria remain undeveloped.

**Gap 3: Non-Western Perspectives and Comparative Analysis**

- **Evidence**: The dominant frameworks (MacIntyre, Gadamer, Arendt, Oakeshott, Taylor) analyze Western traditions in Western modernity. Studies of colonial tradition destruction (Ranger 2012, Whyte 2019) document what was destroyed but rarely engage non-Western philosophical frameworks for understanding tradition itself.
- **Why it matters**: If tradition-breakdown frameworks are parochially Western, they may misdiagnose dynamics in non-Western contexts or miss forms of tradition resilience not captured by Western categories. Piccolo (2023) notes that even ostensibly "decolonizing" critical theory imposes categories alien to Indigenous thought.
- **How research might address it**: Engagement with non-Western philosophical traditions on tradition itself (Islamic, Confucian, African, Indigenous). Comparative analysis of whether breakdown mechanisms identified in Western literature apply cross-culturally. Attention to cases of tradition survival and revival, not just breakdown.
- **Supporting literature**: Ali (2022) on Islamic revivalism as response to modernity's crisis; Piccolo (2023) on Indigenous thought's irreducibility to Western frameworks; but sustained comparative tradition theory is absent.

**Gap 4: Micro-Level Transmission Failure**

- **Evidence**: Most literature operates at macro-level: civilizational transitions, political regime collapse, philosophical tradition crises. The micro-level processes by which transmission fails—how specific practices lose practitioners, how institutions stop cultivating virtues, how apprenticeship relations dissolve—receive less systematic attention.
- **Why it matters**: Macro-level breakdown consists of accumulated micro-level failures. Understanding the latter is essential for both diagnosis and intervention. Shils (1981) and Polanyi (1958) identify transmission mechanisms; but empirical research on their actual failure in specific cases is limited.
- **How research might address it**: Ethnographic and sociological research on contemporary tradition transmission failure in specific domains (religious education, professional apprenticeship, political socialization). Connecting such research to philosophical frameworks on tradition structure.
- **Supporting literature**: Jeon (2024) on Arendtian authority crisis in education; Snir (2018) on education and tradition transmission; but empirical micro-level research is sparse.

**Gap 5: Contemporary Democratic Tradition Erosion**

- **Evidence**: Bennett and Livingston (2018) identify disinformation as pathway to legitimacy crisis; van Ham et al. (2017) question empirical evidence for uniform legitimacy decline; Somer (2019) documents Turkey's democratic breakdown. But systematic application of tradition-breakdown frameworks to contemporary democratic erosion remains underdeveloped.
- **Why it matters**: If democratic norms and institutions constitute traditions in the philosophically relevant sense, then the tools developed for understanding tradition breakdown should illuminate current democratic crises. Yet most democratic-backsliding literature proceeds without engaging this tradition-theoretic vocabulary.
- **How research might address it**: Conceptual analysis of whether democratic constitutionalism constitutes a "tradition" in MacIntyre's or Oakeshott's sense. Application of epistemological crisis, authority erosion, and practice corruption frameworks to contemporary democratic challenges.
- **Supporting literature**: Achilles (2025) reinterprets Weimar as robust democratic culture despite regime collapse; Choudhry (2018) connects Weimar to contemporary constitutional theory; but tradition-theoretic analysis of democratic erosion remains nascent.

**Synthesis**: The literature on tradition breakdown remains fragmented across philosophical, sociological, and historical disciplines. Philosophical frameworks provide conceptual vocabulary but lack empirical grounding; case studies provide evidence but lack theoretical integration. Key unresolved questions include: (a) what distinguishes healthy adaptation from destructive change, (b) whether Western frameworks apply cross-culturally, (c) how micro-level transmission failures aggregate into macro-level collapse, and (d) whether contemporary democratic erosion constitutes tradition breakdown in the philosophically relevant sense.

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the main findings of the review and position the research question within the broader literature.

**Content**:
- Summary of key findings: Traditions are dynamic processes requiring active appropriation through practices, narratives, and authoritative transmission. They break down through multiple mechanisms—internal (epistemological crisis, ossification, practice corruption) and external (rationalist reform, high-modernist state projects, secularization, colonial destruction)—that typically interact and compound.
- The authority-tradition nexus (Arendt) emerges as central: traditions require authority for transmission, while authority depends on tradition for legitimacy. This mutual dependence means breakdown can cascade once either element weakens.
- Invented traditions exhibit distinctive vulnerabilities, but the organic/invented distinction is less sharp than Hobsbawm suggested. What matters is whether traditions successfully embed in meaningful practices and maintain adaptive capacity.
- Conservative and communitarian diagnoses provide rich phenomenological accounts of tradition loss in Western modernity but may be limited in their applicability to non-Western contexts or to traditions that are themselves oppressive.
- The project's research question—how and why traditions break down—opens onto significant gaps in the literature: the need for better integration of philosophical and empirical approaches, clearer criteria distinguishing adaptation from destruction, attention to non-Western perspectives, and systematic application to contemporary democratic erosion.
- Expected contributions: A unified framework for understanding tradition breakdown would connect philosophical tradition theory with historical and sociological research, providing both diagnostic tools and criteria for evaluating when tradition preservation is warranted versus when traditions should be allowed to fail.

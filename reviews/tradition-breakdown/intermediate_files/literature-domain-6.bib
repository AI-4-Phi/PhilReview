====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses theoretical accounts from conservative and communitarian
thinkers who diagnose tradition breakdown as a central problem of modernity.
Conservative thinkers from Burke through Scruton emphasize the organic, inherited
nature of traditions and diagnose their erosion through rationalist reform,
revolutionary disruption, and liberal abstraction. Communitarian critics like
MacIntyre, Sandel, and Taylor focus on how liberal individualism and procedural
neutrality undermine the constitutive communities and shared narratives necessary
for tradition maintenance. MacIntyre's influential After Virtue traces moral
fragmentation to the Enlightenment project's abandonment of Aristotelian teleology
and tradition-constituted rationality. These thinkers offer rich phenomenological
accounts of how traditions fail: through forgetting of origins, severance from
practice, loss of authoritative narratives, and the displacement of substantive
goods by procedural frameworks.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for understanding normative diagnoses of tradition
breakdown. Unlike descriptive sociological accounts, these thinkers take tradition
seriously as a philosophical category and offer sustained arguments about what is
lost when traditions fail. Their work identifies specific mechanisms: Burke's
critique of rationalist reform destroying accumulated wisdom; MacIntyre's account
of how liberal individualism severs the narrative unity necessary for virtue;
Taylor's analysis of authenticity's devolution into shallow self-fulfillment;
communitarian critiques of neutrality as itself a tradition-eroding stance.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most of this literature focuses on Western liberal modernity. Less attention to
non-Western conservative traditions or to internal conservative debates about which
traditions deserve preservation. Limited engagement with empirical questions about
actual mechanisms of breakdown vs. philosophical claims about what ought to be
preserved.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Distinguish between: (1) Burkean conservative emphasis on organic growth vs.
revolutionary rupture; (2) MacIntyrean focus on narrative unity and practice;
(3) communitarian emphasis on constitutive communities vs. liberal atomism;
(4) Taylor's phenomenology of authenticity and moral sources. Note tensions
between universalist natural law conservatives and particularist tradition-
dependent conservatives. Consider how these diagnoses might apply beyond the
liberal-communitarian debate.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Burkean conservatism (5 papers): Organic tradition vs. rationalist reform
- MacIntyrean virtue ethics (6 papers): Tradition-constituted rationality vs. liberal individualism
- Communitarian critique (4 papers): Constitutive communities vs. liberal neutrality
- Conservative cultural criticism (3 papers): Cultural decay and loss of shared standards

@book{macintyre1981after,
  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory},
  year = {1981},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Modern moral discourse is fragmented and incoherent because the Enlightenment project abandoned Aristotelian teleology and tradition-constituted rationality. Virtue can only be understood within practices, the narrative unity of a human life, and living moral traditions. Liberal individualism severs these connections, producing emotivism and moral incommensurability.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational work for understanding how liberal modernity undermines tradition. MacIntyre argues that traditions are not static inheritances but ongoing arguments extended through time, requiring practices, narratives, and authoritative exemplars. His account of how the Enlightenment project fragmented moral tradition is central to understanding philosophical diagnoses of tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Aristotelian-Thomist virtue ethics; critique of liberal individualism and Enlightenment rationalism. Argues for tradition-dependent rationality against both liberal universalism and postmodern relativism.

  year = {1988},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  doi = {10.2307/2074148},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rationality is tradition-constituted; there is no neutral standpoint from which to adjudicate between rival traditions. Different moral and political traditions (Aristotelian, Augustinian, Humean, liberal) embody incommensurable standards of justice and rationality. Traditions progress through epistemological crises that reveal their explanatory inadequacies.

  RELEVANCE: Extends After Virtue's argument about tradition-dependence to rationality itself. Shows how liberal attempts at tradition-neutral reason actually embody a particular (failed) tradition. Explains how traditions can degenerate: not just through external disruption but through internal inability to resolve epistemological crises, leading to fragmentation and eventual breakdown.

  POSITION: Historical epistemology; tradition-constituted rationality. Argues liberal Enlightenment rationalism is itself a failed tradition rather than neutral framework.

  title = {Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition},
  year = {1990},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Three rival approaches to moral inquiry (Enlightenment encyclopedism, Nietzschean genealogy, and Thomist tradition) represent incommensurable standpoints. Encyclopedism's claim to neutral, systematic knowledge has collapsed. Genealogy reveals power behind knowledge claims but cannot ground positive morality. Only tradition-based inquiry, grounded in practices and narrative, can sustain moral rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Completes MacIntyre's trilogy on tradition and rationality. Shows how Enlightenment encyclopedic project's collapse leaves only genealogical critique or renewed tradition. Relevant for understanding why modern attempts to reconstruct tradition-neutral morality fail, producing either relativism or nostalgia.

  POSITION: Thomist tradition against both Enlightenment universalism and postmodern genealogy. University as locus of tradition-based inquiry.

  volume = {17},
  number = {4},
  pages = {449--475},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885118782384},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The idea of a unified conservative tradition is a belated 20th-century construction. Burke was a reformist Whig, not the father of conservatism. The typologies of conservatism developed by Mannheim, Epstein, and Huntington imposed retrospective coherence on diverse historical positions. No transhistorical conservative doctrine exists.

  RELEVANCE: Critical historical account questioning whether "conservatism" as a tradition actually exists. If Bourke is right, conservative diagnoses of tradition breakdown may themselves be products of invented traditions. Challenges this domain's assumption that conservative thinkers share a unified perspective on tradition.

  POSITION: Historical skepticism about conservative tradition. Argues conservatism is retrospectively constructed rather than organically developed.

@book{taylor1989sources,
  author = {Taylor, Charles},
  title = {Sources of the Self: The Making of the Modern Identity},
  year = {1989},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Modern identity is constituted by moral sources and frameworks that give meaning to life. These sources (theism, naturalism, expressivism) provide "strong evaluations" beyond mere preferences. Modernity narrows moral sources through procedural liberalism and instrumental reason, but attempts to live without constitutive frameworks fail. Articulating suppressed moral sources is necessary for coherent selfhood.

  RELEVANCE: Phenomenological account of how modern identity loses connection to constitutive moral sources and traditions. Taylor shows how Enlightenment naturalism and liberal proceduralism attempt to do without strong evaluations, producing shallow authenticity and loss of meaningful frameworks. Essential for understanding communitarian diagnosis of how liberal neutrality erodes substantive traditions.

  POSITION: Communitarian phenomenology of selfhood. Against liberal atomism and procedural reason; for recognition of constitutive communities and moral sources.

  year = {1991},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  doi = {10.4159/9780674237117},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Authenticity is a legitimate modern ideal but has degenerated into shallow self-fulfillment disconnected from horizons of significance. Authentic selfhood requires dialogical recognition and connection to broader moral frameworks beyond the self. Critics who dismiss authenticity entirely (Bloom, Bell) miss its genuine moral force, but boosters who celebrate "anything goes" relativism betray its original meaning.

  RELEVANCE: Diagnosis of how a genuine tradition (Romantic authenticity) degenerates into self-centered individualism. Shows how traditions can be corrupted while retaining their vocabulary: "authenticity" now means self-gratification rather than truthfulness to a horizon of significance. Relevant for understanding internal tradition decay vs. external breakdown.

  POSITION: Retrieval of authentic authenticity against both conservative dismissal and relativist celebration. Communitarianism as middle path.

@book{sandel1982liberalism,
  author = {Sandel, Michael J.},
  title = {Liberalism and the Limits of Justice},
  year = {1982},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls's liberalism presupposes an unencumbered self prior to its ends, but selves are constituted by communal attachments and identities. Justice as fairness requires a conception of the person as freely choosing rational agent, but this atomistic view cannot account for constitutive communities, shared meanings, or narrative identity. Procedural liberalism's neutrality among conceptions of the good undermines the substantive communities necessary for meaningful choice.

  RELEVANCE: Classic communitarian critique showing how liberal individualism conceptually severs the ties between self and community. If selves are constituted by communal attachments, then liberal neutrality doesn't protect traditions—it erodes the very ground of selfhood. Diagnosis of how procedural liberalism makes tradition maintenance impossible.

  POSITION: Communitarian critique of liberal atomism. Constitutive communities vs. voluntarist association.

@book{sandel1996democracy,
  author = {Sandel, Michael J.},
  title = {Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy},
  year = {1996},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: American public life has shifted from republican civic tradition to procedural liberalism, producing civic disempowerment and loss of formative institutions. Procedural republic's neutrality on the good life evacuates public discourse of substantive moral content, leaving only economic interest and individual rights. Globalization and market forces erode local communities and civic republican traditions that sustained democratic self-governance.

  RELEVANCE: Extended diagnosis of how liberal proceduralism erodes republican civic traditions in American context. Shows concrete mechanisms: nationalization of politics, displacement of formative institutions (churches, unions, local government), replacement of civic virtue with consumer choice. Demonstrates how tradition breakdown manifests in actual political culture.

  POSITION: Civic republicanism against procedural liberalism. Communitarian recovery of formative political traditions.

@book{scruton1980meaning,
  author = {Scruton, Roger},
  title = {The Meaning of Conservatism},
  year = {1980},
  publisher = {Macmillan},
  address = {London},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservatism is not mere disposition but substantive philosophy defending authority, allegiance, and traditional institutions against rationalist reform. Society is an organism extended through time; individuals are born into obligations and identities. Conservative politics preserves the delicate balance of institutions embodying accumulated practical wisdom against abstract ideological schemes that disrupt organic development.

  RELEVANCE: Systematic defense of conservative view of tradition as organic inheritance requiring reverence and gradual adaptation. Scruton diagnoses tradition breakdown through rationalist reform, egalitarian leveling, and loss of authoritative institutions. Emphasizes how traditions depend on pre-rational allegiances and embodied practices that abstract liberalism cannot recognize.

  POSITION: Traditional conservatism. Authority and allegiance against individualism and egalitarianism.

@incollection{macintyre1984patriotism,
  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {Is Patriotism a Virtue?},
  booktitle = {Theorizing Citizenship},
  editor = {Beiner, Ronald},
  year = {1984},
  publisher = {State University of New York Press},
  address = {Albany},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Liberal morality claims universal impartiality, but substantive moral identity requires particular loyalties to nation, tradition, community. Patriotism—understood as loyalty to particular political community and its traditions—is a central virtue, but liberal universalism renders it unintelligible. Morality is necessarily tradition-dependent; attempts to transcend all particular loyalties produce incoherent cosmopolitanism.

  RELEVANCE: Shows tension between liberal universalism and particularist traditions. Argues liberal demand for impartial moral standpoint severs necessary connection between identity and particular communities. Relevant for understanding why liberal individualism cannot sustain traditions: it delegitimates the particular loyalties traditions require.

  POSITION: Virtue ethics; particularism vs. cosmopolitan liberalism. Patriotism as constitutive virtue.

  volume = {10},
  number = {1},
  pages = {9--29},
  doi = {10.12681/cjp.38547},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre's opposition between liberalism and Aristotelian virtue ethics is overdrawn. Classical liberal decentralization and federalism can actually enable local communities to cultivate virtue and pursue substantive goods. Liberal individualism may provide political space for Aristotelian communities to flourish, rather than necessarily undermining them.

  RELEVANCE: Recent critique suggesting MacIntyrean diagnosis of liberal erosion may be overstated. Raises question whether tradition breakdown stems from liberal institutions themselves or from other aspects of modernity. Relevant for evaluating whether communitarian critique correctly identifies mechanism of tradition loss.

  POSITION: Defense of classical liberalism's compatibility with virtue ethics and local tradition cultivation.

  publisher = {Bloomsbury Academic},
  address = {London},
  doi = {10.5040/9798216435662},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Human rights are not antithetical to MacIntyre's virtue ethics but necessary to prevent its appropriation for problematic communal projects and to recognize those outside one's tradition. Engages MacIntyre with postcolonial critics and historians of rights, showing how rights can constrain institutional power excess while preserving tradition-based rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Recent work addressing limitations of MacIntyrean tradition-centered approach, particularly its potential blindness to exclusion and power. Relevant for considering whether conservative/communitarian emphasis on tradition preservation can recognize when traditions are oppressive. Suggests internal critique of tradition-breakdown diagnosis.

  volume = {43},
  number = {4},
  pages = {591--616},
  doi = {10.1111/jore.12114},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality can be defended against charges of relativism. Traditions are not closed systems but engage in rational debate with rivals, undergo epistemological crises, and can recognize superior explanatory power. Thomist Aristotelianism provides resources for tradition-based yet non-relativist moral inquiry.

  RELEVANCE: Defense of MacIntyrean framework against standard liberal objection that tradition-dependence entails relativism. Relevant for assessing whether conservative/communitarian diagnoses of tradition breakdown can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate traditions. Addresses question of how traditions can be rationally evaluated.

  POSITION: Thomist virtue ethics; tradition-constituted but non-relativist rationality.

  number = {1},
  pages = {21--44},
  doi = {10.1163/18722636-12341240},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre offer three incompatible accounts of tradition. Arendt: tradition as thread of authoritative past, now broken. Oakeshott: tradition as practical knowledge in activities, always present. MacIntyre: tradition as extended argument requiring epistemological justification. These differences reflect deeper disagreements about modernity, rationality, and historical consciousness.

  RELEVANCE: Comparative analysis showing diversity within conservative/communitarian tradition discourse. Arendt sees irreparable break, Oakeshott sees continuity, MacIntyre sees need for rational reconstruction. Relevant for understanding different diagnoses of tradition breakdown: complete rupture, gradual erosion, or epistemological crisis requiring response.

  author = {Fawcett, Edmund},
  title = {Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition},
  year = {2020},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservatism is not static defense of tradition but ongoing adaptation to liberal-democratic modernity. Conservatives have consistently fought over what to conserve, how to adapt, and whether to accommodate or resist change. Modern conservatism emerged not from Burke's defense of tradition but from 19th-century accommodation to industrialization, mass democracy, and capitalism.

  RELEVANCE: Historical account challenging unified conservative tradition. Shows conservative thinkers disagreeing fundamentally about tradition's value and meaning. If conservatism itself lacks unified tradition, its diagnosis of tradition breakdown becomes more complex: which traditions, according to which conservatives, have broken down?

  POSITION: Historical pluralism about conservatism. Skeptical of unified conservative tradition.

  title = {Conservatism: Burke, Nozick, Bush, Blair?},
  year = {2005},
  publisher = {Pluto Press},
  address = {London},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservatism has a fundamental principle: defending hierarchical social order serving the interests of already advantaged. From Burke's organic hierarchy to Nozick's libertarianism to contemporary neo-conservatism, the tradition consistently rationalizes inequality. Appeals to tradition, organic society, and gradual reform serve ideological function of preserving elite power.

  RELEVANCE: Ideological critique of conservative tradition discourse. Argues conservative laments about tradition breakdown mask defense of hierarchical privilege. Relevant for considering whether conservative diagnoses are philosophical insights or ideological justifications. Challenges this domain's substantive claims.

  POSITION: Left critique of conservatism as ideology defending inequality.

  number = {3},
  pages = {425--442},
  doi = {10.1017/S0031819119000196},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scruton's aesthetic theory attempts to defend traditional Western art forms against modernist abandonment. He argues artists were wrong to abandon tonal harmony, representational painting, and narrative form. Scruton's conservative aesthetics grounds tradition in human nature and beauty's objective demands, not mere cultural convention.

  RELEVANCE: Application of conservative tradition-defense to aesthetics. Shows how Scruton diagnoses cultural tradition breakdown: not just political but in art, music, and architecture. Modernist self-conscious rejection of form exemplifies rationalist destruction of inherited practices. Extends conservative diagnosis beyond politics to broader cultural sphere.

  POSITION: Conservative aesthetics. Traditional forms grounded in human nature and objective beauty.

@book{horcher2020political,

  title = {A Political Philosophy of Conservatism: Prudence, Moderation and Tradition},
  year = {2020},
  publisher = {Bloomsbury Academic},
  address = {London},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservative political philosophy centers on Aristotelian phronesis (practical wisdom) as alternative to rationalist reform. Prudence requires sensitivity to particulars, cultural traditions, and practical constraints that abstract theory ignores. Conservative defense of tradition flows from recognition that accumulated practical wisdom in institutions exceeds any individual's rational comprehension.

  RELEVANCE: Contemporary defense of conservative tradition-centered politics rooted in Aristotelian virtue of prudence. Shows how conservative diagnosis of tradition breakdown connects to epistemology: rationalist reformers overestimate capacity of abstract reason to design institutions, ignoring embodied practical knowledge in traditions. Relevant for understanding conservative critique of liberal constructivism.

  editor = {Zalta, Edward N.},
  year = {2020},
  publisher = {Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Communitarian critique of liberalism has three components: methodological (tradition and context matter for moral reasoning), ontological (selves are socially constituted), and normative (community has intrinsic value). Main targets are Rawls's abstract individualism, liberal neutrality on the good, and priority of rights over communal goods. While critics never embraced "communitarian" label, core arguments challenge liberal assumptions about autonomous selves and neutral state.

  RELEVANCE: Authoritative overview of communitarian-liberal debate. Shows how communitarian concern with tradition loss stems from deeper ontological claims about constituted selfhood and epistemological claims about tradition-dependent reasoning. Useful for distinguishing methodological, metaphysical, and normative strands in communitarian diagnosis of liberal erosion.

  POSITION: Neutral exposition of communitarian arguments and liberal responses. Identifies core philosophical issues in debate.

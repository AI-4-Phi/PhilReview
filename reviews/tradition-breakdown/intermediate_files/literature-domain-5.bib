====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The concept of "invented tradition" was brought to prominence by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger's seminal 1983 volume, which argued that many traditions claiming ancient origins are in fact recent constructions designed to establish social cohesion, legitimize institutions, or inculcate values. This framework has generated extensive scholarly debate about the distinction between "authentic" organic traditions and "invented" fabricated ones, particularly regarding their vulnerability to breakdown.

The literature reveals three main debates: First, whether the organic/invented distinction can be meaningfully maintained, as all traditions involve some degree of selective construction and reconstruction (Alexander 2016; Taruskin 2020). Second, whether invented traditions are inherently less stable than organic ones, with some scholars suggesting fabricated traditions lack the embedded social practices necessary for resilience (Ranger 2012; Kelley 2012), while others point to the durability of nationalist myths (Abizadeh 2014). Third, how ideology and political manipulation corrupt traditions through instrumentalization for nationalist, religious, or state purposes (McCarty 2017; Bogumiล‚ & ลukaszewicz 2018).

The domain encompasses case studies ranging from British royal pageantry and colonial African traditions to Buddhist tree ordinations and Turkmen personality cults. A consistent finding is that invented traditions often serve to consolidate power rather than preserve authentic cultural memory, making them particularly vulnerable to exposure and loss of legitimacy when their constructed nature becomes apparent.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Understanding invented traditions is crucial for analyzing tradition breakdown because it reveals how the fabrication or ideological distortion of traditions creates inherent instability. When traditions are instrumentalized for political purposes or revealed to lack genuine historical roots, they lose the embedded social legitimacy that sustains organic traditions. This domain directly addresses the project's questions about what makes traditions vulnerable to breakdown and what distinguishes authentic tradition maintenance from mere ideological manipulation.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses heavily on nationalist and colonial contexts, with less attention to how invented religious traditions break down. Additionally, there's limited philosophical analysis of the normative distinction between acceptable "reconstruction" of tradition (Eisenstadt) versus problematic "invention"—a gap that affects how we evaluate the ethics of tradition manipulation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain with others, pay particular attention to how Hobsbawm's concept intersects with theories of tradition degeneration (Domain 3) and nationalist manipulation (Domain 4). The tension between "all traditions are somewhat invented" and "some traditions are more fabricated than others" should be explored philosophically, not just empirically.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Hobsbawmian critique: Invented traditions are ideologically constructed pseudo-traditions (7 papers)
- Continuist position: All traditions involve reconstruction and selection (4 papers)
- Nationalist instrumentalization: Traditions manipulated for political identity construction (5 papers)
- Legitimacy crisis: Invented traditions vulnerable to breakdown when exposed (2 papers)

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hobsbawm argues that many traditions which appear or claim to be ancient are often recent in origin and sometimes deliberately invented. He defines "invented tradition" as a set of practices, normally governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rules of a ritual or symbolic nature, which seek to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past—even when this historical continuity is largely factitious. The introduction establishes that such inventions are particularly common during periods of rapid social transformation when old traditions break down.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational text establishes the theoretical framework for analyzing how traditions can be fabricated rather than organically evolved. Hobsbawm's distinction between genuine custom (which adapts flexibly) and invented tradition (which claims invariance) is crucial for understanding tradition breakdown: invented traditions are inherently more brittle because they lack the embedded social practices and genuine historical continuity that make organic traditions resilient. His observation that invented traditions proliferate when older traditions break down directly addresses the project's core question about what causes tradition failure.

  POSITION: Foundational text in the critical historical analysis of tradition construction. Establishes the conceptual framework for distinguishing between organic and fabricated traditions, emphasizing how the latter serve ideological functions in modern nation-states.

  pages = {211--262},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ranger demonstrates how European colonial powers in Africa invented "traditions" that were then imposed on or adopted by African societies, fundamentally altering indigenous social structures. He shows that colonizers created rigid "customary law" systems, invented tribal identities, and fabricated historical precedents to legitimize colonial rule. These invented traditions took on a peculiar character in Africa—more rigid and ahistorical than either European or Asian imperial forms—because they served to freeze African societies in an imagined "traditional" past while colonial modernity was reserved for Europeans.

  RELEVANCE: Ranger's analysis reveals how invented traditions can be deliberately weaponized to control populations and reshape social structures. His emphasis on the rigidity and inflexibility of invented traditions—contrasted with the fluid adaptability of genuine pre-colonial African social practices—suggests that fabricated traditions are inherently vulnerable to breakdown precisely because they lack the organic flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. This directly illuminates one mechanism of tradition breakdown: when traditions are too rigid to adapt, they shatter under pressure rather than evolving.

  POSITION: Colonial-critical perspective showing how invented traditions served as instruments of domination. Emphasizes the destructive impact of fabricated traditions on organic African social practices.

  journal = {Journal of Vietnamese Studies},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {7},
  number = {2},
  pages = {87--130},
  doi = {10.1525/vs.2012.7.2.87},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kelley demonstrates through textual criticism that the "historical" account of Vietnam's legendary Hรนng kings, found in the 15th-century text Lฤฉnh Nam chรญch quรกi liแป‡t truyแป‡n, was not transmitted orally from the first millennium BCE as traditionally claimed but was created after Vietnam achieved autonomy in the 10th century. This constitutes a clear case of an "invented tradition" that served to legitimize the new autonomous Vietnamese state by providing it with an ancient foundational mythology comparable to China's legendary dynasties.

  RELEVANCE: This case study provides concrete historical evidence for how invented traditions function in nation-building contexts. Kelley's analysis shows that the invented nature of the Hรนng kings tradition did not prevent it from becoming deeply embedded in Vietnamese national consciousness for centuries. This challenges simplistic assumptions that invented traditions are necessarily unstable or prone to breakdown—suggesting instead that what matters is whether a tradition successfully embeds itself in social practices and institutions, regardless of its historical authenticity. The paper thus complicates the relationship between fabrication and tradition vulnerability.

  POSITION: Represents the historical-critical methodology applied to tradition analysis, demonstrating through textual evidence how traditions are constructed to serve contemporary political needs rather than preserving genuine ancient memory.

  journal = {Journal of Political Philosophy},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {22},
  number = {3},
  pages = {213--236},
  doi = {10.1111/jopp.12038},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Abizadeh argues that liberal nationalism faces a fundamental tension: national identities invariably depend on historical myths and invented traditions, yet liberal democratic theory is committed to norms of publicity, public justification, and freedom of expression that should expose and reject such myths. He contends that the nationalist defense of publicly shared historical myths contradicts liberal democracy's epistemic and moral commitments to truth and rational justification. Liberal nationalists cannot coherently advocate for the perpetuation of national myths while simultaneously endorsing the critical scrutiny that liberal institutions demand.

  RELEVANCE: Abizadeh's argument directly addresses the project's concern with tradition breakdown by identifying a structural vulnerability in modern nationalist traditions: their dependence on myths that cannot withstand critical examination. This suggests that invented traditions in liberal democratic contexts contain the seeds of their own breakdown, as the very institutional commitments to free inquiry and rational discourse that characterize liberal democracy will eventually expose their fabricated nature. The paper thus illuminates how certain types of political systems make invented traditions particularly unstable.

  POSITION: Liberal-democratic critique of nationalism, arguing that the epistemological commitments of liberalism are fundamentally incompatible with the mythological foundations of national identity.

  journal = {Asian Affairs},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {47},
  number = {1},
  pages = {71--92},
  doi = {10.1080/03068374.2015.1128681},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Munro traces the historical origins of Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) concept and demonstrates that it is much newer than official narratives suggest—an invented tradition in Hobsbawm and Ranger's sense. He shows that GNH only emerged as a coherent policy framework in the 1990s-2000s, despite retrospective claims that it has ancient Buddhist roots or dates to the 1970s. The meteoric rise of GNH as Bhutan's official ideology represents a state-driven nation-building project responding to rapid social change and the need to forge national unity in a plural society.

  RELEVANCE: This contemporary case study demonstrates how invented traditions function in modern state-building contexts. Munro's analysis reveals that GNH was deliberately constructed to provide ideological coherence during a period of disruptive modernization—precisely the context where Hobsbawm argued invented traditions proliferate. The paper illuminates how modern states manufacture traditions to address legitimacy crises, but also raises questions about the long-term stability of such constructions: if GNH's invented nature becomes widely recognized, will it lose its efficacy as a unifying national ideology? This directly addresses the project's questions about tradition vulnerability.

  volume = {3},
  number = {3},
  pages = {393--428},
  doi = {10.1628/219944617x15014860816638},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarty examines how Roman-era traditions of Punic cultural practices in North Africa—particularly the alleged continuation of child sacrifice—were largely invented or dramatically exaggerated by Roman elites to construct a distinctive "Punic" African identity that served Roman imperial interests. He demonstrates that archaeological and textual evidence does not support the claimed continuity of Carthaginian religious practices into the Roman period, and argues that Romans and Romanized Africans created these "Punic traditions" to negotiate their relationship with empire and forge a regional identity distinct from both Rome and indigenous Berber cultures.

  RELEVANCE: McCarty's analysis of religious tradition invention in antiquity provides important historical depth to debates about fabricated traditions. His work shows that the phenomenon of inventing traditions for political purposes is not merely modern but has ancient precedents. Crucially, he demonstrates how invented religious traditions can serve multiple, sometimes contradictory purposes: Romans used "Punic barbarism" to justify conquest while simultaneously romanticizing a Carthaginian past. This complexity suggests that invented traditions' stability depends less on their historical authenticity than on their continued political utility—and when that utility ends, the traditions collapse.

  number = {3},
  pages = {569--590},
  doi = {10.1177/0888325417747969},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bogumiล‚ and ลukaszewicz analyze the Russian Orthodox Church's 2000 canonization of over 1,000 "New Martyrs"—victims of Soviet repression—as an invented tradition that transforms history into religion for political purposes. They demonstrate that the New Martyrdom serves not primarily as genuine religious commemoration but as an instrument for the Church and Russian state to construct a narrative about the past that legitimizes current political arrangements and reinforces Russian nationalism. The authors show how the Church addresses problematic aspects of this project (such as canonizing figures with dubious moral records) through flexible reinterpretation.

  RELEVANCE: This contemporary case illuminates how religious institutions fabricate traditions to serve state political objectives, directly addressing the project's concerns about tradition manipulation and ideological distortion. The paper reveals a key vulnerability of invented traditions: the tension between claimed religious authenticity and obvious political instrumentalization. When traditions are transparently constructed for regime legitimization, they risk losing credibility—yet the authors note that the New Martyrdom has proven remarkably resilient despite obvious political manipulation, suggesting that invented traditions can be stable if they align with powerful institutional interests even when their constructed nature is apparent.

  POSITION: Critical analysis of post-Soviet religious-political ideology, showing how the Russian Orthodox Church manufactures traditions to support authoritarian state power.

  journal = {Journal of the Philosophy of History},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {10},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--28},
  doi = {10.1163/18722636-12341313},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding tradition that moves beyond the organic/invented dichotomy. He argues that all traditions involve both transmission from the past and active construction in the present, making the sharp distinction between "authentic" and "invented" traditions untenable. Traditions are better understood as processes of selective appropriation, reinterpretation, and reconstruction rather than as either purely authentic preservation or cynical fabrication. Alexander proposes that tradition's defining feature is not its historical continuity but its claim to bind the present to the past through practices that participants experience as meaningful.

  RELEVANCE: Alexander's theoretical synthesis challenges the premise underlying much research on invented traditions—namely, that we can meaningfully distinguish "real" from "fake" traditions based on historical authenticity. This has profound implications for analyzing tradition breakdown: if all traditions involve construction and reconstruction, then vulnerability to breakdown cannot be attributed simply to being "invented." Instead, Alexander's framework suggests we should examine how successfully traditions embed themselves in meaningful practices and whether they maintain their experienced meaningfulness for participants. This shifts the question from "is it authentic?" to "does it work?"—a more fruitful approach for understanding tradition failure.

  POSITION: Theoretical synthesis attempting to transcend the organic/invented dichotomy by emphasizing tradition as an ongoing process of meaningful construction rather than authentic preservation.

  journal = {Ethnic Culture},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {4},
  number = {2},
  pages = {12--19},
  doi = {10.31483/r-102802},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Obidina compares Hobsbawm's concept of invented tradition with Shmuel Eisenstadt's theory of multiple modernities, arguing that while both contradict classical modernization theory's view of modernity as a complete break with tradition, they offer different understandings of tradition's role. Where Hobsbawm emphasizes invention and discontinuity, Eisenstadt emphasizes transformation and reconstruction. Obidina argues that Eisenstadt's framework better captures how traditions genuinely evolve in modernity: not through wholesale invention but through selective appropriation and creative reinterpretation of existing cultural resources. She contends that what Hobsbawm calls "invention" is often better understood as "transformation" or "reconstruction."

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis directly addresses a key tension in the invented traditions literature: whether the concept overstates the degree of fabrication and discontinuity involved. Obidina's argument that reconstruction differs fundamentally from invention has implications for understanding tradition breakdown: traditions that undergo genuine transformation while maintaining continuity with past practices may be more resilient than those that involve wholesale fabrication. This suggests that the vulnerability of invented traditions stems not just from their being "fake" but from their disconnect from lived social practices and cultural memory—a more nuanced understanding than simple authenticity/inauthenticity.

  POSITION: Comparative theorizing attempting to nuance the invented tradition concept by distinguishing invention from reconstruction and emphasizing cultural continuity even in modernizing contexts.

  volume = {36},
  number = {2},
  pages = {234--289},
  doi = {10.1111/musa.12094},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cook analyzes early recordings of Webern's Piano Variations Op. 27 to show how a performance tradition was invented in the post-WWII period, despite the work having been composed before the war. He demonstrates through computational analysis of recordings that competing interpretive approaches—one deriving from the pre-war Schoenberg circle tradition, another from the post-war Darmstadt avant-garde—battled for dominance before a consensus interpretation emerged around 1970. Cook argues this case exemplifies how musical "traditions" are actively constructed through performance practice rather than being organically transmitted, and how very different aesthetic and ideological commitments shaped these constructions.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on musical performance rather than social-political traditions, Cook's analysis provides valuable insights into how traditions are constructed and stabilized in practice. His demonstration that radically different "traditions" of performing the same work coexisted and competed suggests that invented traditions are not necessarily stable or unified but can fragment into competing versions. The eventual emergence of a consensus tradition shows how invented traditions can achieve stability through institutional power (recording industry, music schools) rather than through organic social transmission. This complicates narratives of tradition breakdown by showing that consolidation and fragmentation can occur simultaneously.

  number = {3},
  pages = {489--502},
  doi = {10.1080/03906701.2012.730824},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Palmisano and Pannofino critically analyze Hobsbawm and Ranger's "invention of tradition" concept and propose the alternative concept of "inventive tradition" to capture how tradition functions as a resource for cultural creativity in religious contexts. Using the New Age movement's appropriation of various religious traditions as a case study, they argue that religious actors do not simply "invent" traditions ex nihilo but creatively recombine and reinterpret existing traditional elements. This process is better understood as inventive appropriation rather than wholesale fabrication, and it demonstrates tradition's dynamism rather than exposing its inauthenticity.

  RELEVANCE: This article offers a constructive critique of the Hobsbawmian framework that nuances understanding of how traditions change and adapt. By emphasizing the creative agency involved in tradition appropriation, Palmisano and Pannofino suggest that what appears as "invention" may actually be a normal process of tradition evolution. This has implications for tradition breakdown: if traditions naturally involve creative reinterpretation, then breakdown might occur not when traditions change but when they become too rigid to permit such creativity. This inverts conventional assumptions about tradition vulnerability—suggesting that inflexibility, not inventiveness, is what makes traditions fragile.

  POSITION: Sociological analysis of religious innovation arguing for a more dynamic understanding of tradition that emphasizes creative appropriation rather than dichotomizing authentic preservation versus cynical invention.

  pages = {166--183},
  doi = {10.21313/hawaii/9780824833664.003.0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Otto examines how the Manus people of Papua New Guinea have constructed new traditions and memories about their past in the context of rapid social change and interaction with Western modernity. He shows that Manus leaders deliberately created new rituals, origin narratives, and cultural practices in the mid-20th century to forge a coherent ethnic identity and resist colonial domination. Otto argues that these invented traditions were not cynical manipulations but genuine attempts by Manus people to make sense of traumatic disruption and maintain cultural continuity under conditions of violent change.

  RELEVANCE: Otto's anthropological perspective provides crucial insights into how invented traditions function in contexts of cultural crisis and breakdown. His emphasis on invention as a creative response to tradition collapse (rather than a cause of it) suggests that the relationship between fabrication and breakdown is more complex than simple causation. Sometimes traditions must be actively reconstructed precisely because older traditions have already failed under pressure from colonialism and modernity. This implies that invented traditions may be attempts to prevent or respond to breakdown rather than inherently vulnerable constructions. Otto thus complicates the project's questions about what causes tradition failure.

  publisher = {University of Wisconsin Press},
  year = {2015},
  isbn = {9780299308407},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Handler examines how the history and canon of anthropology itself involves processes of tradition invention—selectively remembering certain figures while forgetting others, constructing lineages and schools that obscure more complex historical realities. He argues that anthropology's disciplinary identity has been shaped by invented traditions about its own past, which has excluded contributions from women, non-Western scholars, and those who didn't fit neat theoretical categories. Handler demonstrates that even academic disciplines, which claim objectivity and careful historical scholarship, engage in the same processes of tradition invention that they study in other societies.

  RELEVANCE: Handler's reflexive analysis has important implications for the project's investigation of tradition breakdown. If even academic disciplines—with their explicit commitment to historical accuracy and evidence—invent traditions about their own past, this suggests that tradition invention is not simply a matter of political manipulation or deliberate deception but a more fundamental aspect of how communities construct collective identity and memory. This raises philosophical questions about whether any tradition can claim "authenticity" in Hobsbawm's sense, and whether the vulnerability of invented traditions stems from their fabricated nature or from their exposure and delegitimization by critical scholarship.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kroeze and Keulen analyze how business leaders at major Dutch multinationals deliberately use invented traditions and historical narratives as management tools. Through oral history interviews, they show that corporate executives consciously construct traditions and symbols, selectively appropriate company history, and create "corporate memory" to strengthen organizational identity, communicate values, and connect past, present and future. The authors argue that business history and invented tradition theory reveal how leaders operate in practice: not through rational-bureaucratic management alone but through symbolic and narrative manipulation of the company's relationship to its own past.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of corporate tradition invention provides insights into how fabricated traditions function in organizational contexts outside the political sphere. The finding that corporate leaders consciously and strategically invent traditions—and that employees often accept these as legitimate despite their obvious recent construction—suggests that invention is not necessarily destabilizing if it serves the interests of powerful actors and aligns with organizational needs. This implies that invented traditions' vulnerability to breakdown depends heavily on power dynamics: when leaders lose authority or when organizational interests shift, the traditions they constructed can rapidly collapse. This power-centered analysis enriches understanding of tradition fragility.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Heinzen examines how British and Hanoverian elites constructed divergent memorial traditions about the Napoleonic Wars over the 19th century, despite having fought together as allies. He shows that commemorative practices, military monuments, and historical narratives about the wars were actively invented and shaped by nationalist agendas on both sides, with each nation emphasizing different battles and heroes to serve contemporary political purposes. These invented traditions created fundamentally incompatible memories of the same historical events, demonstrating how tradition invention is shaped by nation-state politics rather than by historical reality.

  RELEVANCE: Heinzen's comparative analysis reveals how the same historical events can generate radically different invented traditions depending on political context, illuminating an important mechanism of tradition instability. When invented traditions are tied to nationalist politics, they become vulnerable to breakdown when political circumstances change or when their constructed nature is exposed through comparison with competing national narratives. The paper suggests that transnational historical comparison can delegitimize invented traditions by revealing their partisan construction—a finding relevant to understanding how traditions break down under critical scrutiny.

  doi = {10.16995/ane.11},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Morrow analyzes the practice of "tree ordination" in Thailand—symbolically ordaining trees as monks to protect forests—arguing that Western scholarship has misinterpreted this as evidence of Buddhism's inherent environmental consciousness. He demonstrates that tree ordination is actually an invented tradition dating only to the 1980s-90s, based not primarily on Buddhist teaching but on the sanctity of Buddhist symbols combined with Thai spirit worship and monarchical symbolism. Tree ordinations performed by non-Buddhist minorities in Thailand demonstrate a political commitment to environmentalism rather than religious conviction, revealing the practice's modern political character.

  RELEVANCE: Morrow's analysis of Thai environmental activism provides a case study of how invented traditions can be retrospectively attributed with ancient religious origins even when they are clearly modern political practices. This speaks directly to questions of tradition authenticity and stability: the invented tradition of tree ordination functions effectively for environmental protection precisely because participants and observers accept its claimed Buddhist roots without critical examination. This suggests that invented traditions can be stable and functional as long as their constructed nature is not widely recognized—but they become vulnerable to breakdown once exposed as recent fabrications lacking genuine traditional grounding.

  volume = {5},
  pages = {171--181},
  doi = {10.21146/0042-8744-2023-5-171-181},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vorontsov examines contemporary philosophical theories of tradition, arguing that while they share a common discourse that challenges the opposition between tradition and rationality, they assign vastly different meanings to the concept of tradition itself. He analyzes how figures like T.S. Eliot, Michael Oakeshott, and Karl Popper developed theories that ascribe rationality and flexibility to tradition, while Hobsbawm's "invented tradition" concept paradoxically assumes tradition to be rigid and unchangeable even as it emphasizes tradition's deliberate and rational construction. Vorontsov argues that this conceptual multiplicity reflects philosophers' inability to transcend the Cartesian subject paradigm—they simply attribute to tradition the qualities they previously ascribed to reason, blurring the concept.

  RELEVANCE: Vorontsov's meta-theoretical analysis reveals fundamental conceptual tensions within tradition theory that have implications for understanding tradition breakdown. If the concept of tradition lacks clear boundaries and incorporates contradictory meanings (flexible vs. rigid, rational vs. non-rational, authentic vs. invented), then theories of tradition breakdown may be addressing fundamentally different phenomena. His argument that the invented tradition concept treats tradition as rigid while other theories emphasize flexibility suggests that Hobsbawm may have identified a particular pathological form of tradition (rigid ideological constructions) rather than tradition as such. This conceptual clarification is essential for the project.

  POSITION: Meta-theoretical philosophical analysis examining contradictions and conceptual confusions within contemporary tradition theory, particularly regarding the rationality/tradition dichotomy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume examines how both North and South Korea have extensively invented traditions since their division in 1945, using fabricated historical narratives, rituals, and cultural practices to construct distinct national identities and legitimize their competing political systems. Contributors analyze diverse cases including North Korea's personality cult traditions, South Korea's reinvention of traditional folk practices, and both states' manipulation of shared historical memory. The volume demonstrates that tradition invention is not just a historical phenomenon but an ongoing process central to contemporary Korean state-building and political legitimation.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative study of two states emerging from a shared cultural background provides powerful evidence for how tradition invention serves political legitimation in divided nations. The parallel invention of distinct traditions in North and South Korea—despite their common historical roots—shows how fabricated traditions can be deliberately constructed to create incompatible national identities. This has implications for tradition breakdown: when invented traditions are so closely tied to regime legitimacy, political change can rapidly delegitimize the traditions themselves. The contrast between the two Koreas suggests that authoritarian regimes rely more heavily on invented traditions for legitimation, making those traditions more vulnerable when the regime is challenged.

  POSITION: Comparative political anthropology analyzing tradition invention in divided Korea, emphasizing the role of state power in constructing and maintaining fabricated traditions.

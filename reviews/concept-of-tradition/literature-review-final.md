## Introduction

Tradition occupies a paradoxical position in contemporary thought. It is simultaneously dismissed as an obstacle to progress and rehabilitated as a condition of understanding itself. The Enlightenment framed tradition as prejudice to be overcome by autonomous reason, yet twentieth-century philosophy has mounted sustained challenges to this framing. Gadamer (1989) argued that the Enlightenment harbored a "prejudice against prejudice," failing to recognize that understanding always proceeds from within traditions rather than from a standpoint external to them. This hermeneutic rehabilitation transformed tradition from an object of critique into a constitutive feature of rational inquiry.

The concept of tradition spans multiple disciplines with distinct definitions and normative valences. In political philosophy, tradition appears as a source of authority and practical wisdom (Burke, Oakeshott) or as ideology masking arbitrary power (critical theory). In sociology, tradition names anything transmitted from the past (Shils) or specifically those practices claiming explicit continuity with authoritative sources (Beckstein 2016). In social ontology, traditions may be collective intentional states, organized practices, or institutional facts. These disciplinary variations are not merely terminological; they reflect fundamentally different ontological commitments and political implications.

The central puzzle animating this literature concerns tradition's relationship to rational critique. Is tradition opposed to reason, as Enlightenment thinkers maintained, or is critique always tradition-constituted, as MacIntyre (1988) argues? This question has profound political stakes. If all rationality is tradition-bound, then the Enlightenment project of liberating reason from traditional authority appears either incoherent or itself a tradition among others. Yet if traditions can perpetuate domination and distortion, as critical theorists insist, then hermeneutic rehabilitation risks legitimating what should be criticized.

Three organizing tensions structure the scholarly literature. First, is tradition inherited or constructed? Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) influentially argued that many apparently ancient traditions are modern inventions serving present political purposes, challenging essentialist accounts that treat traditions as organic continuities. Second, is tradition authoritative or ideological? Conservative accounts emphasize tradition's role in transmitting practical wisdom, while critical accounts reveal how appeals to tradition can mask power and exclude marginalized voices. Third, does tradition enable or constrain rational agency? Gadamer and MacIntyre argue that tradition enables understanding and inquiry; their critics worry that tradition-based accounts cannot adequately ground critique and reform.

This review synthesizes the contested definitions, the rationality debate, and contemporary political applications of the concept of tradition. It moves from contested definitions and ontologies through the central debate about tradition and rationality to research gaps concerning tradition's social ontology and non-Western dimensions. The aim is not encyclopedic coverage but analytical engagement with the core tensions that make tradition a contested and consequential concept for political philosophy.


## Contested Definitions and Ontologies of Tradition

The concept of tradition resists univocal definition. Across philosophical, sociological, and anthropological literatures, "tradition" names phenomena ranging from the broadest category of inherited culture to highly specific practices claiming authoritative continuity with a valued past. These definitional variations are not merely semantic; they carry distinct ontological commitments and political implications that shape how tradition figures in debates about authority, rationality, and social change.

### Definitional Spectrum and Conceptual Distinctions

At the broadest end of the definitional spectrum, Edward Shils (1981) treats tradition as encompassing "anything transmitted or handed down from the past to the present," including beliefs, practices, institutions, and material objects. This maximally inclusive definition captures tradition's role in social continuity but threatens to dissolve the concept into mere cultural inheritance, leaving unclear what distinguishes tradition from habit, custom, or convention. As Jacobs (2007) reconstructs, Shils synthesizes multiple perspectives on tradition's value: pragmatic (useful accumulated knowledge), Burkean (embodied collective wisdom), veridical (transmission of truth), and evolutionist (products of social selection). Yet this very richness generates tensions about which properties are essential.

Martin Beckstein (2016) offers a more exacting analysis, arguing that traditions are distinguished by three features: claimed continuity with the past, explicit transmission between generations, and capacity for authentic development. Unlike mere customs, traditions involve reflexive awareness of their historical lineage and normative authority derived from that lineage. Beckstein's central insight concerns how traditions can change while remaining the same: authentic continuation requires that modifications be "comprehensible as developments of the tradition's core commitments rather than breaks from them" (Beckstein 2016, 502). This resolves the apparent paradox that living traditions must evolve to survive, yet evolution threatens their identity.

The distinction between tradition and custom proves analytically crucial. Kenneth Olwig (2001) captures this through a memorable formulation: custom is "time out of mind" while tradition is "mind out of time." Customs are tacit, embedded practices whose origins recede into unreflective antiquity; traditions are explicitly thematized inheritances, consciously transmitted as authoritative. This distinction carries normative weight: customs may embody practical wisdom accumulated through trial and error, while traditions involve claims about what the past demands of the present. Political philosophy has not sufficiently attended to this difference, often treating "tradition" and "custom" as synonymous when they name distinct social phenomena with different relationships to rational critique.

The relationship between tradition and convention further clarifies tradition's distinctive features. David Lewis's (1969) canonical analysis defines conventions as arbitrary solutions to coordination problems, sustained by mutual expectations rather than inherent authority. Conventions are self-enforcing equilibria: I drive on the right because I expect you to, and you expect me to. Andrei Marmor (2009) extends this by distinguishing "deep conventions" (constitutive rules creating new possibilities) from "surface conventions" (mere coordination devices). Traditions differ from both: they are not arbitrary but claim non-arbitrary authority derived from their historical sources. A tradition's legitimacy purportedly derives from what it transmits, not merely from the fact that participants converge on it. Where conventions can be replaced by equally good alternatives, traditions claim irreplaceable value tied to their specific historical lineage.

### Social Ontological Status of Traditions

If traditions are real social phenomena, what kind of entities are they? Contemporary social ontology offers competing frameworks, though few directly address tradition. John Searle's (1995) influential account of institutional facts provides one approach: social entities exist through collective acceptance of status functions via the formula "X counts as Y in context C." Traditions might be understood as practices that count as authoritative inheritances within a community. Yet as Joshua Rust (2021) argues, Searle's rule-based framework is better suited to modern legal-rational authority than to traditional authority, which operates through exemplars and precedents rather than constitutive rules. Traditional legitimacy derives not from collective acceptance of a rule but from recognized continuity with authoritative paradigm cases.

Margaret Gilbert's (1996) plural subject theory offers an alternative grounding. On this view, collective phenomena are constituted by joint commitments that create obligations participants cannot unilaterally revoke. Traditions would be plural subjects whose members are jointly committed to maintaining and transmitting certain practices. This helps explain tradition's normative force: participants feel bound to continue practices because joint commitment creates genuine obligations, not merely expectations. Gilbert's framework illuminates how traditions persist despite membership turnover, since the plural subject transcends its current participants.

Theodore Schatzki's (2002) practice-based social ontology provides yet another approach. For Schatzki, social phenomena are organized arrays of human activity constituted by practical understandings, rules, and "teleoaffective structures" (ends, projects, emotions). Traditions on this view are not primarily mental states or collective beliefs but organized practices embodied in concrete activities and material arrangements. This captures how traditions are transmitted through participation rather than explicit instruction, and why they involve not just beliefs but skills, dispositions, and emotional orientations.

Recent work attempts integration. Brouwer, Ferrario, and Porello (2020) develop a "hybrid" account of collective intentionality that incorporates both individual commitments and irreducibly collective properties. Applied to tradition, this suggests that traditional practices involve both personal reasons for participation and genuinely collective features that transcend individual attitudes. Traditions may require what Raimo Tuomela (2002) calls "we-mode" engagement: participants acting as members of a tradition-bearing group rather than as isolated individuals pursuing private purposes.

What unites these approaches is recognition that traditions possess emergent social properties not reducible to individual mental states. But what remains undertheorized is the temporal dimension: how traditions maintain identity across generational turnover, how transmission mechanisms sustain collective properties over time, and whether the same social ontological frameworks adequate for synchronic collective phenomena can capture tradition's essentially diachronic character.

### Construction, Invention, and Authenticity

The "invention of tradition" thesis challenges essentialist accounts that treat traditions as organic inheritances gradually evolved from time immemorial. Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger's (1983) influential collection demonstrates that many apparently ancient traditions are modern political constructions: the Scottish Highland tradition, British royal ceremony, and colonial administrative practices all involved deliberate invention claiming false antiquity. Hobsbawm defines "invented tradition" as practices "seeking to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past" (Hobsbawm 2012, 1). The political function is clear: invented traditions legitimate institutions, establish social cohesion, and socialize individuals into desired behaviors by borrowing the authority of a fabricated past.

Richard Handler and Jocelyn Linnekin (1984) radicalize this critique, arguing that the genuine/spurious distinction cannot be maintained because all tradition involves symbolic construction in the present. What appears as continuity always involves selective interpretation and creative reinterpretation. "Authenticity" is not an objective property but a category used within traditions to validate certain practices over others. If this is correct, even traditions with genuine historical depth are continuously reconstructed rather than passively inherited.

This constructivist consensus has been extended to intellectual traditions themselves. Richard Bourke (2018) and Emily Jones (2017) have demonstrated that "Burkean conservatism" as a political tradition was largely a nineteenth-century invention, retrospectively constructing Edmund Burke as founder of a coherent conservative doctrine he never articulated. Stephen Prickett (2002) traces similar dynamics in how religious and literary traditions have been invented and reinvented to serve present purposes while claiming ancient pedigree.

Yet radical constructivism generates its own difficulties. If all traditions are equally constructed, what grounds remain for tradition's normative authority? One response, developed by Ton Otto and Poul Pedersen (2005), seeks synthesis: traditions involve both genuine transmission and inventive appropriation, with agents drawing on inherited resources to address new circumstances. Neither pure continuity nor pure invention captures how tradition actually operates. Beckstein (2016) provides philosophical resources here: the question is not whether traditions change but whether changes count as authentic continuation or rupture. Criteria for authentic development can acknowledge construction while preserving space for normative assessment.

The constructivist challenge reveals that tradition's authority cannot rest solely on claimed antiquity, since such claims may be fabricated. But it does not follow that construction delegitimates tradition entirely. Traditions might be evaluated by their consequences, internal coherence, or capacity for self-criticism rather than their origins. This unresolved tension between sociological constructivism and normative political philosophy shapes subsequent debates about whether and when traditions deserve authority.


## Tradition, Rationality, and Authority

The relationship between tradition and rational critique constitutes the central tension in philosophical treatments of tradition. Since the Enlightenment, political philosophy has grappled with a fundamental question: Does rationality require transcending tradition, or is all rational inquiry necessarily tradition-constituted? This section traces how the Enlightenment framed tradition as prejudice opposed to autonomous reason, examines hermeneutic and virtue-ethical rehabilitations of tradition, considers critical theory's insistence that such rehabilitations remain inadequate for ideology-critique, and explores how the tradition-modernity binary itself has been contested by reflexive modernization theory, multiple modernities scholarship, and postcolonial perspectives.

### The Enlightenment Critique and Its Legacy

The Enlightenment positioned tradition as the primary obstacle to human emancipation. Kant's sapere aude demanded that individuals exercise their own reason rather than defer to inherited authority, framing tradition as tutelage from which rational agents must liberate themselves. As Dostal (2016) demonstrates, this Enlightenment stance generated what Gadamer would later identify as a "prejudice against prejudice"—the unexamined assumption that genuine understanding requires freedom from traditional commitments.

Yet the Enlightenment critique of tradition has its own genealogy that complicates any simple opposition between tradition and reason. Folkers (2016) traces how Foucault's genealogical investigations reveal that critique itself emerged from specific historical practices—particularly religious techniques of conscience examination that became secularized in Enlightenment demands for autonomous reason. Critique, on this account, is not a timeless standpoint outside tradition but rather an ethos with its own history, what Foucault characterizes as "permanent critique." The paradox is inescapable: the tradition of critiquing tradition is itself a tradition.

This paradox becomes particularly acute when viewed from non-Western perspectives. Allen (2016) argues that Frankfurt School critical theory, despite its critique of Enlightenment, remains complicit in Eurocentric progress narratives that privilege Western modernity as the telos of human emancipation. The very framing of tradition versus reason, she contends, universalizes a specifically European problematic. Tayob (2018) reinforces this point through analysis of Islamic intellectual history, showing how Muslim modernists from Muhammad Abduh to Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd developed critical relationships to tradition that do not conform to Kantian Enlightenment frameworks. These alternative critical traditions suggest that the opposition between tradition and rational critique may be parochial rather than universal—a product of particular European historical experiences rather than a necessary structure of rational inquiry.

### Hermeneutic and Virtue-Ethical Rehabilitation

Against the Enlightenment's dismissal, hermeneutic philosophy and virtue ethics rehabilitated tradition as enabling rather than obstructing rational understanding. Gadamer's (1989) philosophical hermeneutics argues that the Enlightenment harbored an unexamined prejudice—the assumption that understanding requires liberation from tradition. On the contrary, Gadamer contends, prejudice (Vorurteil) and belonging to tradition are conditions of possibility for understanding rather than obstacles to it. Effective-historical consciousness (wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstsein) reveals that we always understand from within traditions; this situatedness is not a limitation to overcome but the ground from which genuine understanding proceeds.

Warnke (1987) clarifies how Gadamer's position avoids both Enlightenment foundationalism and relativism. Effective-historical consciousness enables critical reflection on tradition, not mere passive acceptance. Understanding involves a "fusion of horizons" between interpreter and tradition, in which prejudgments are tested and revised through encounter with what is other. The hermeneutic circle—the movement between part and whole, between prejudgment and revision—provides resources for critique from within tradition rather than from an impossible standpoint outside it.

MacIntyre (1988) develops a parallel account of "tradition-constituted rationality" within an Aristotelian-Thomist framework. Against liberal Enlightenment claims to tradition-independent rationality, MacIntyre argues that all rational inquiry occurs within traditions that supply standards of justification, paradigmatic texts, and modes of argument. Different traditions—Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal—possess incommensurable conceptions of justice and rationality. Yet MacIntyre denies that this entails relativism. Traditions can be rationally compared: one tradition proves superior to another when it can explain why the rival tradition encountered problems it could not solve by its own lights, while the superior tradition resolves those problems.

D'Andrea (2017) and Lutz (2004) explicate how MacIntyre's account allows for rational progress within traditions through epistemological crises—moments when a tradition's resources prove inadequate and must be fundamentally revised. Such crises can be resolved through creative reformulation that preserves continuity while addressing novel challenges. Crucially, as Kuna (2005) emphasizes, traditions can learn from rivals and even acknowledge their own rational defeat. Tradition-constituted rationality thus accommodates both the embeddedness of reason in particular traditions and the possibility of tradition-transcending rational judgment.

Beam (1998) notes both convergences and divergences between Gadamer's hermeneutic approach and MacIntyre's virtue-ethical account. Both share a common critique of Enlightenment rationalism's pretension to tradition-independent reason; both rehabilitate tradition as resource rather than obstacle. Yet Gadamer emphasizes the linguisticality and ontological character of understanding, while MacIntyre focuses on moral traditions, practices, and the virtues required for sustaining rational inquiry.

### Critical Theory and Feminist Challenges

Despite the sophistication of hermeneutic and virtue-ethical rehabilitations, critical theory maintains that these approaches cannot adequately address tradition's ideological functions. Habermas (1990) crystallizes this objection: Gadamer's hermeneutics fails to account for systematically distorted communication and the ways tradition can embody relations of domination invisible from within. While Gadamer correctly identifies tradition's role in understanding, he provides no resources for ideology-critique—for recognizing when traditions perpetuate oppression under the guise of wisdom.

Forst (2023) articulates the Frankfurt School's central concern: critical theory aims to uncover forms of social domination ideologically presented as rationality—what Adorno termed "the unreason of the dominant reason." Traditions can function as such ideology, naturalizing contingent power arrangements and foreclosing emancipatory alternatives. The question is whether critique can function without resources external to tradition—whether Gadamer's encounter with otherness within tradition provides sufficient distance for recognizing systematic distortion.

Feminist theory intensifies this challenge while complicating simple oppositions. Benhabib (1992) develops "situated universalism" as an alternative to both liberal abstraction from social situatedness and communitarian imprisonment within tradition. Critical reflection, she argues, emerges from within traditions but can achieve universalist moral perspective through communicative rationality. Gender analysis reveals that both Enlightenment liberalism and communitarian defenses of tradition have excluded women's perspectives—the supposedly universal liberal subject is gendered masculine, while "tradition" has often meant patriarchal inheritance.

Allen (2008) synthesizes Frankfurt School critical theory with Foucauldian analytics of power to show how subjects are constituted through traditional norms and power relations. Autonomy, on this account, cannot mean standing outside tradition but rather involves critical engagement with the very traditions and power structures that shape us. The critical subject is always already tradition-formed; critique transforms tradition from within rather than transcending it entirely.

Yet postcolonial feminist perspectives challenge whether critique must always take the form of liberal rejection. Mahmood, as analyzed by Velji (2024), critiques "teleological feminism" that assumes agency only manifests as resistance to traditional norms. Through ethnography of Egyptian piety movements, Mahmood reveals how women cultivate agency through traditional Islamic practices rather than against them. Karoui (2020) similarly shows how feminist scholars like Fatima Mernissi recover progressive resources from classical Islamic tradition to challenge patriarchal interpretations from within. These interventions suggest that the critical feminist relationship to tradition need not replicate Enlightenment rejection; immanent transformation may be as emancipatory as oppositional overcoming.

### Tradition and Modernity Revisited

The binary opposition between tradition and modernity—which structures the debates traced above—has itself been contested by social theory since the 1990s. Reflexive modernization theory, multiple modernities scholarship, and postcolonial critique each challenge the assumption that modernity simply displaces tradition.

Beck, Giddens, and Lash (1994) argue that late modernity involves not tradition's elimination but its transformation. In "post-traditional" society, traditions lose their taken-for-granted character and must be explicitly chosen and justified. This "reflexive modernization" creates new modes of relating to tradition: rather than unreflective acceptance, modern subjects consciously appropriate, revise, or reject inherited practices. Tradition persists, but its authority must now be actively defended rather than assumed. Giddens (1991) emphasizes that this does not mean traditions disappear; rather, they are "disembedded" and "re-embedded" in new contexts, their continuation requiring reflexive justification.

Eisenstadt's (2000) multiple modernities framework challenges the assumption that modernization produces convergence on a Western model. Different civilizations—shaped by distinct religious traditions (Christian, Islamic, Confucian, Hindu, Buddhist)—develop distinctive patterns of modernity that incorporate rather than replace traditional elements. Western modernity is thus one pattern among many, not a universal template. This framework fundamentally challenges the tradition-modernity binary: "tradition" (understood as civilizational and cultural programs) does not disappear with modernization but shapes the specific form modernity takes in different contexts.

Bracke (2008) extends this analysis through ethnographic research on young Evangelical and Islamic women in the Netherlands who construct "pious modernity"—modern identities articulated from within religious frameworks rather than against them. These women incorporate and produce modernity while remaining committed to traditional religious practices, challenging the assumption that modern agency requires secularization. The concept of "pious modernity" suggests tradition and modernity can be conjugated in ways that neither classical modernization theory nor communitarian tradition-defense anticipated.

Postcolonial perspectives reveal that the tradition-modernity binary itself serves hegemonic functions. George (2024) examines how postcolonial scholars constructed tradition and modernity as antagonistic, viewing modernity as colonial imposition. Against this, Ambedkarite scholarship shows how B.R. Ambedkar synthesized traditional and modern elements, embracing modernity's emancipatory promise while critiquing oppressive traditional hierarchies like caste. For subordinated groups, aspects of modernity may be liberating from oppressive traditions rather than alienating from authentic culture. Gyekye (1997) develops a similar position from African philosophy, advocating critical evaluation of both traditional and modern elements based on their contribution to human flourishing—neither wholesale westernization nor uncritical traditionalism.

These perspectives converge on a crucial insight: the tradition-modernity opposition is itself a product of particular historical circumstances—specifically, European experiences of industrialization and secularization—rather than a universal analytical framework. Genuine engagement with non-Western contexts requires moving beyond this binary to recognize how traditions are continuously reinvented in modern conditions and how modernities take multiple forms shaped by civilizational inheritances.

---

The debate between tradition and rational critique remains unresolved, but its terms have been fundamentally transformed. Hermeneutic and virtue-ethical accounts convincingly demonstrate that understanding and inquiry are tradition-constituted; there is no view from nowhere from which tradition might be assessed by pure reason. Yet critical theorists rightly insist that traditions can perpetuate domination in ways that hermeneutic encounter with otherness may fail to reveal. The contemporary challenge is developing accounts of tradition that acknowledge both its enabling role—as condition of understanding and framework for inquiry—and its potential for ideological distortion, without collapsing into either naive traditionalism or abstract rationalism. Feminist and postcolonial perspectives complicate this task by revealing that both Enlightenment critique and hermeneutic rehabilitation may reproduce exclusions, while also demonstrating that transformative agency can emerge from within traditional practices rather than only through their rejection.


## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals that while scholarship on tradition spans multiple disciplines and theoretical orientations, significant lacunae remain. Four interconnected gaps invite sustained philosophical attention, each with direct implications for political philosophy's engagement with tradition.

### Gap 1: The Social Ontology of Tradition Remains Under-Theorized

Despite sophisticated work on collective intentionality and social practices, the social ontological status of tradition specifically has received surprisingly little attention. The major frameworks—Searle's (1995) collective acceptance of status functions, Gilbert's (1996) joint commitment theory, and Schatzki's (2002) practice-based approach—address social phenomena generally but rarely engage tradition as a distinctive category. Searle's framework explains how institutional facts persist through collective recognition, yet leaves unclear what constitutes a tradition's identity conditions across generational change. Gilbert's emphasis on normative commitment illuminates why traditions bind participants, but her focus on synchronic phenomena underdevelops the diachronic dimension essential to tradition. Schatzki's practice theory captures tradition's embodied, materially mediated character, yet his account of organized activities does not address what makes some practices traditional rather than merely habitual.

The temporal dimension presents the sharpest challenge. Tradition is fundamentally about persistence and transmission across generations, yet collective intentionality theory has focused predominantly on synchronic questions: what constitutes a group at a moment, not how collective entities persist through time and membership change. Brouwer, Ferrario, and Porello (2020) offer a hybrid approach integrating individual and collective modes, but their formal framework does not specifically address intergenerational transmission. Rust (2021) challenges Searle's social ontology on grounds that illuminate tradition's peculiar status: if traditions require collective acceptance, whose acceptance counts when membership continuously changes?

This gap matters for political philosophy because normative questions about tradition's authority presuppose ontological clarity about what traditions are. If we cannot specify how traditions persist as identical entities across generations, we cannot coherently ask whether their authority claims are legitimate. Integrating collective intentionality theory with practice-based accounts and cognitive science of cultural transmission (Czachesz 2018; Whitehouse 2021) represents a promising research direction.

### Gap 2: Non-Western Frameworks Are Marginalized

The literature on tradition remains strikingly Eurocentric. The core debates—Gadamer versus Habermas, tradition versus Enlightenment rationality, the conservative defense of inherited wisdom—presuppose specifically Western intellectual contexts. When non-Western traditions appear, they typically function as objects of analysis rather than sources of theoretical insight.

Allen (2016) and Getachew and Mantena (2021) argue that this marginalization is not accidental but structural: the very framing of "tradition versus modernity" emerges from European self-understanding and the experience of colonialism. The tradition-modernity binary, as Argyrou (2002) demonstrates, positions non-Western societies as "traditional" and therefore backward, awaiting modernization along Western lines. Gyekye (1997) shows how this binary distorts African philosophical engagement, which characteristically seeks synthesis rather than choosing between tradition and modernity. Tayob (2018) reveals that Islamic intellectual traditions develop their own sophisticated frameworks for relating inherited practice to critical inquiry—frameworks invisible when "tradition" is defined through opposition to Enlightenment reason.

The marginalization has two dimensions. First, comparative political theory remains underdeveloped: Confucian, Islamic, and African approaches to tradition are rarely engaged as potential resources for political philosophy (Ivanhoe 2014). Second, the liberal multiculturalism framework, despite its inclusive rhetoric, treats non-Western traditions as claims to be accommodated rather than as sources of normative theory (Turner 2018). Decolonizing engagement with tradition requires not merely including more cases but fundamentally reconceiving the conceptual vocabulary.

### Gap 3: Normative Implications of Constructivism Are Unresolved

Hobsbawm and Ranger's (1983) "invention of tradition" thesis demonstrated that many apparently ancient practices are modern political constructions. Subsequent historical work has extended this finding: Jones (2017) and Bourke (2018) show that even "the conservative tradition" associated with Burke is a nineteenth-century invention; Prickett (2002) reveals how Romantic intellectuals constructed notions of tradition in response to Enlightenment critique. Handler and Linnekin (1984) argue that the genuine/spurious distinction itself is untenable—all traditions involve symbolic reconstruction.

Yet this constructivist consensus sits uneasily with normative political philosophy, which continues to ask evaluative questions about tradition's authority. Otto and Pedersen (2005) attempt synthesis, arguing that constructivism and continuity claims are compatible: traditions can be constructed and genuinely continuous with the past. Beckstein (2016) develops criteria for "authentic continuation" that acknowledge development while preserving identity. But neither fully resolves the normative puzzle: if traditions are constructed to serve present purposes, what grounds remain for their authoritative claims?

Two positions require philosophical development. First, traditions might be evaluated consequentially—by their effects on human flourishing rather than their origins. Second, traditions might derive authority from their capacity for self-criticism and rational development (MacIntyre 1988), regardless of whether they were constructed. Neither position has been systematically elaborated in relation to the constructivist literature. The gap is politically urgent: if constructivism entails debunking, then appeals to tradition in democratic politics are ideological mystification; if not, we need clearer criteria for evaluation.

### Gap 4: Tradition in Pluralist Democratic Contexts

Liberal multiculturalism, the dominant framework for addressing tradition in contemporary political theory, faces persistent challenges. Kymlicka (2017) defends the framework as the most compelling approach to state-minority relations, but critics identify structural limitations. Turner (2018) argues that multiculturalism relies on essentialized conceptions of culture that misrepresent how people actually relate to traditions. Getachew and Mantena (2021) contend that even inclusive multiculturalism remains Western-centric, treating non-Western political thought as an "other" to accommodate rather than engage substantively.

More fundamentally, Turner (2012) identifies a "liberal paradox": liberalism requires social solidarity to function, yet its individualism undermines traditional communal sources of solidarity. The Westphalian settlement and Lockean liberalism, he argues, are increasingly inadequate for managing conflicting religious traditions in multicultural societies. Deliberative democracy offers a procedural response, but it may bracket precisely the substantive tradition-based claims that require address.

Political pluralism (Muniz-Fraticelli 2014) represents an alternative, recognizing that associations possess legitimate authority not derived from state recognition but from internal structures and members' practices. This framework takes tradition-based authority seriously without requiring liberal endorsement. Yet pluralism requires clearer criteria for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate tradition-based claims—criteria the current literature does not adequately provide.

The deliberative and pluralist responses also share a limitation: they lack mechanisms for determining when traditions warrant transformation or rejection rather than accommodation. Democratic theory needs frameworks that can critically evaluate tradition-based claims without either imposing liberal hegemony or collapsing into relativism.

### Synthesis

These four gaps are systematically interconnected. The ontological question—what are traditions?—informs the normative question—when do they deserve authority? Both shape the political question—how should pluralist democracies engage tradition-based claims? Non-Western frameworks may offer resources for all three that Western philosophy has overlooked, precisely because they have developed outside the tradition-versus-modernity framing that structures European thought.

Addressing these gaps requires integrative theoretical work: combining social ontology with normative theory, engaging non-Western sources as contributors rather than cases, developing evaluative criteria that acknowledge construction, and articulating democratic frameworks for tradition-based claims. Such integration would advance both the conceptual clarity and political applicability of political philosophy's engagement with tradition.


## Conclusion

This review has traced how the concept of tradition operates across multiple literatures in political and cultural thought, revealing both productive tensions and significant lacunae. What emerges is neither a unified concept nor mere equivocation, but a family of meanings united by tradition's distinctive claim: that the past exercises normative authority over the present through practices of transmission and continuation.

The definitional landscape spans from Shils's maximally broad conception of tradition as anything transmitted from past to present to Beckstein's (2016) more demanding criteria requiring explicit transmission, claimed continuity, and capacity for authentic development. This conceptual range is not merely terminological; it reflects deeper disagreements about tradition's ontological status—whether traditions are collective intentional states, organized practices, or institutional facts constituted through collective acceptance (Searle 1995; Gilbert 1989). The sharp distinction between tradition and adjacent concepts like custom and convention reveals what is distinctive: traditions claim non-arbitrary authority derived from historical sources, whereas customs operate tacitly and conventions resolve coordination problems without historical grounding.

The central debate organizing this literature concerns tradition's relationship to rational critique. Gadamer's (1989) hermeneutic philosophy demonstrates that understanding is always tradition-constituted—we interpret from within horizons shaped by effective history, such that prejudice enables rather than obstructs genuine understanding. MacIntyre (1988) develops a parallel account of tradition-constituted rationality, arguing that standards of rational justification are internal to traditions while maintaining that traditions can rationally assess themselves through epistemological crises and engage rivals. Against these rehabilitations, Habermas (1990) insists that hermeneutic approaches lack resources for identifying systematically distorted communication and ideological tradition. The question remains unresolved: can critique function without resources external to tradition, or does genuine critique require standing outside the traditions it evaluates?

Neither naive traditionalism nor abstract Enlightenment rationalism proves adequate. The constructivist challenge—that traditions are invented rather than organically continuous (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983)—undermines essentialist accounts without necessarily delegitimating tradition's authority claims. If all traditions involve symbolic reconstruction, then evaluation must proceed on grounds other than authenticity of origins. Meanwhile, the "tradition of post-tradition" (Turner 2021) reveals that critiques of tradition constitute their own authoritative lineages, suggesting we cannot fully escape tradition even in diagnosing its end.

Four interconnected gaps invite integrative theoretical work. First, the social ontology of tradition remains under-theorized: philosophical analyses of collective intentionality rarely address tradition explicitly, while sociological treatments lack rigorous ontological foundations for explaining how traditions persist across generational turnover. Second, non-Western frameworks for understanding tradition's relationship to reason and critique are marginalized; the literature treats Confucian, Islamic, and African intellectual traditions as objects of analysis rather than sources of theory (Getachew and Mantena 2021). Third, the normative implications of constructivism remain unresolved—if all traditions are constructed, what grounds remain for evaluating tradition-based claims? Fourth, frameworks for engaging tradition in pluralist democracies require further development; liberal multiculturalism (Kymlicka 2017) and political pluralism (Muniz-Fraticelli 2014) offer competing approaches without fully resolving how democracies can distinguish legitimate tradition-based claims from those warranting critique.

These gaps are not independent but form a constellation. The ontological question—what kind of thing is a tradition?—informs the normative question—when do traditions deserve authority?—which shapes the political question—how should pluralist democracies engage tradition-based claims? Research addressing these questions could contribute by developing rigorous social ontology of tradition that integrates collective intentionality theory with sociology; engaging non-Western intellectual traditions as sources of theory rather than merely case studies; articulating normative criteria that acknowledge construction while preserving space for evaluation; and proposing democratic frameworks capable of adjudicating among competing tradition-based claims without imposing liberal hegemony or collapsing into relativism. The concept of tradition thus remains contested not because of conceptual confusion, but because it names a persistent problem at the intersection of epistemology, social ontology, and political philosophy—one that contemporary theory has yet to resolve.

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals that while scholarship on tradition spans multiple disciplines and theoretical orientations, significant lacunae remain. Four interconnected gaps invite sustained philosophical attention, each with direct implications for political philosophy's engagement with tradition.

### Gap 1: The Social Ontology of Tradition Remains Under-Theorized

Despite sophisticated work on collective intentionality and social practices, the social ontological status of tradition specifically has received surprisingly little attention. The major frameworks—Searle's (1995) collective acceptance of status functions, Gilbert's (1996) joint commitment theory, and Schatzki's (2002) practice-based approach—address social phenomena generally but rarely engage tradition as a distinctive category. Searle's framework explains how institutional facts persist through collective recognition, yet leaves unclear what constitutes a tradition's identity conditions across generational change. Gilbert's emphasis on normative commitment illuminates why traditions bind participants, but her focus on synchronic phenomena underdevelops the diachronic dimension essential to tradition. Schatzki's practice theory captures tradition's embodied, materially mediated character, yet his account of organized activities does not address what makes some practices traditional rather than merely habitual.

The temporal dimension presents the sharpest challenge. Tradition is fundamentally about persistence and transmission across generations, yet collective intentionality theory has focused predominantly on synchronic questions: what constitutes a group at a moment, not how collective entities persist through time and membership change. Brouwer, Ferrario, and Porello (2020) offer a hybrid approach integrating individual and collective modes, but their formal framework does not specifically address intergenerational transmission. Rust (2021) challenges Searle's social ontology on grounds that illuminate tradition's peculiar status: if traditions require collective acceptance, whose acceptance counts when membership continuously changes?

This gap matters for political philosophy because normative questions about tradition's authority presuppose ontological clarity about what traditions are. If we cannot specify how traditions persist as identical entities across generations, we cannot coherently ask whether their authority claims are legitimate. Integrating collective intentionality theory with practice-based accounts and cognitive science of cultural transmission (Czachesz 2018; Whitehouse 2021) represents a promising research direction.

### Gap 2: Non-Western Frameworks Are Marginalized

The literature on tradition remains strikingly Eurocentric. The core debates—Gadamer versus Habermas, tradition versus Enlightenment rationality, the conservative defense of inherited wisdom—presuppose specifically Western intellectual contexts. When non-Western traditions appear, they typically function as objects of analysis rather than sources of theoretical insight.

Allen (2016) and Getachew and Mantena (2021) argue that this marginalization is not accidental but structural: the very framing of "tradition versus modernity" emerges from European self-understanding and the experience of colonialism. The tradition-modernity binary, as Argyrou (2002) demonstrates, positions non-Western societies as "traditional" and therefore backward, awaiting modernization along Western lines. Gyekye (1997) shows how this binary distorts African philosophical engagement, which characteristically seeks synthesis rather than choosing between tradition and modernity. Tayob (2018) reveals that Islamic intellectual traditions develop their own sophisticated frameworks for relating inherited practice to critical inquiry—frameworks invisible when "tradition" is defined through opposition to Enlightenment reason.

The marginalization has two dimensions. First, comparative political theory remains underdeveloped: Confucian, Islamic, and African approaches to tradition are rarely engaged as potential resources for political philosophy (Ivanhoe 2014). Second, the liberal multiculturalism framework, despite its inclusive rhetoric, treats non-Western traditions as claims to be accommodated rather than as sources of normative theory (Turner 2018). Decolonizing engagement with tradition requires not merely including more cases but fundamentally reconceiving the conceptual vocabulary.

### Gap 3: Normative Implications of Constructivism Are Unresolved

Hobsbawm and Ranger's (1983) "invention of tradition" thesis demonstrated that many apparently ancient practices are modern political constructions. Subsequent historical work has extended this finding: Jones (2017) and Bourke (2018) show that even "the conservative tradition" associated with Burke is a nineteenth-century invention; Prickett (2002) reveals how Romantic intellectuals constructed notions of tradition in response to Enlightenment critique. Handler and Linnekin (1984) argue that the genuine/spurious distinction itself is untenable—all traditions involve symbolic reconstruction.

Yet this constructivist consensus sits uneasily with normative political philosophy, which continues to ask evaluative questions about tradition's authority. Otto and Pedersen (2005) attempt synthesis, arguing that constructivism and continuity claims are compatible: traditions can be constructed and genuinely continuous with the past. Beckstein (2016) develops criteria for "authentic continuation" that acknowledge development while preserving identity. But neither fully resolves the normative puzzle: if traditions are constructed to serve present purposes, what grounds remain for their authoritative claims?

Two positions require philosophical development. First, traditions might be evaluated consequentially—by their effects on human flourishing rather than their origins. Second, traditions might derive authority from their capacity for self-criticism and rational development (MacIntyre 1988), regardless of whether they were constructed. Neither position has been systematically elaborated in relation to the constructivist literature. The gap is politically urgent: if constructivism entails debunking, then appeals to tradition in democratic politics are ideological mystification; if not, we need clearer criteria for evaluation.

### Gap 4: Tradition in Pluralist Democratic Contexts

Liberal multiculturalism, the dominant framework for addressing tradition in contemporary political theory, faces persistent challenges. Kymlicka (2017) defends the framework as the most compelling approach to state-minority relations, but critics identify structural limitations. Turner (2018) argues that multiculturalism relies on essentialized conceptions of culture that misrepresent how people actually relate to traditions. Getachew and Mantena (2021) contend that even inclusive multiculturalism remains Western-centric, treating non-Western political thought as an "other" to accommodate rather than engage substantively.

More fundamentally, Turner (2012) identifies a "liberal paradox": liberalism requires social solidarity to function, yet its individualism undermines traditional communal sources of solidarity. The Westphalian settlement and Lockean liberalism, he argues, are increasingly inadequate for managing conflicting religious traditions in multicultural societies. Deliberative democracy offers a procedural response, but it may bracket precisely the substantive tradition-based claims that require address.

Political pluralism (Muniz-Fraticelli 2014) represents an alternative, recognizing that associations possess legitimate authority not derived from state recognition but from internal structures and members' practices. This framework takes tradition-based authority seriously without requiring liberal endorsement. Yet pluralism requires clearer criteria for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate tradition-based claims—criteria the current literature does not adequately provide.

The deliberative and pluralist responses also share a limitation: they lack mechanisms for determining when traditions warrant transformation or rejection rather than accommodation. Democratic theory needs frameworks that can critically evaluate tradition-based claims without either imposing liberal hegemony or collapsing into relativism.

### Synthesis

These four gaps are systematically interconnected. The ontological question—what are traditions?—informs the normative question—when do they deserve authority? Both shape the political question—how should pluralist democracies engage tradition-based claims? Non-Western frameworks may offer resources for all three that Western philosophy has overlooked, precisely because they have developed outside the tradition-versus-modernity framing that structures European thought.

Addressing these gaps requires integrative theoretical work: combining social ontology with normative theory, engaging non-Western sources as contributors rather than cases, developing evaluative criteria that acknowledge construction, and articulating democratic frameworks for tradition-based claims. Such integration would advance both the conceptual clarity and political applicability of political philosophy's engagement with tradition.

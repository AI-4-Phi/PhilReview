====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain investigates how tradition functions as a social phenomenon,
addressing its ontological status, mechanisms of transmission and
maintenance, sources of authority, and relationship to collective agency
and identity. The literature reveals four main theoretical positions:
(1) Collective intentionality accounts (Gilbert, Tuomela, Searle) that
ground tradition in shared intentions and we-attitudes; (2) Practice-based
approaches (Schatzki, MacIntyre) that see tradition as constituted by
socially organized activities; (3) Social institutional theories (Miller,
List & Pettit) that analyze tradition through group agency and collective
responsibility; and (4) Hybrid approaches (Brouwer et al.) that integrate
individual and collective dimensions. The foundational works establish that
tradition cannot be reduced to aggregates of individual beliefs but has
emergent social ontological properties. Recent work explores how traditions
are maintained through ritual practices, material culture, and
intergenerational transmission mechanisms.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the question "What is tradition?" from a
social ontological perspective, establishing that tradition is not merely
an epistemic or normative phenomenon but has distinctive social-ontological
features. The collective intentionality literature illuminates how
traditions are constituted by shared attitudes and commitments among group
members. The practice-based approaches reveal how traditions are embodied
in concrete social activities rather than abstract beliefs. The social
institutional frameworks explain how tradition relates to collective agency,
authority structures, and group identity. This provides the conceptual
infrastructure for understanding tradition as a social entity with its own
ontological status.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited attention to the temporal dimension of tradition—how social
ontological status changes across generations. Few works integrate social
ontology with mechanisms of cultural transmission. Insufficient engagement
with non-Western traditions and Indigenous concepts of collective being.
Little discussion of how digital technologies alter the social ontology of
tradition. The relationship between individual agency and collective
tradition remains undertheorized in most accounts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Key debates center on reductionism vs. emergentism regarding tradition's
social ontological status, and on the priority of individual vs. collective
intentionality. Pay attention to how different theories handle the
persistence of traditions across time and changes in membership. Consider
synthesizing collective intentionality approaches with practice-based
accounts to capture both the mental and material dimensions. The tension
between tradition as constraining and as enabling collective agency warrants
careful analysis.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Collective Intentionality Theory: 4 papers - Tradition grounded in
  shared intentions, joint commitments, and we-mode reasoning
- Practice-Based Social Ontology: 3 papers - Tradition constituted by
  organized social practices with internal standards
- Social Institutional Theory: 3 papers - Tradition as institutional
  structure enabling collective agency and responsibility
- Hybrid/Integrative Approaches: 2 papers - Combining individual and
  collective dimensions

  author = {Searle, John R.},
  title = {The Construction of Social Reality},
  year = {1995},

  doi = {10.2307/2077133},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle develops a theory of social ontology based on
  collective intentionality and constitutive rules. Social facts are
  created through collective assignment of status functions via the
  formula "X counts as Y in context C." Argues that institutional facts
  (including traditions) exist only through collective recognition and
  acceptance, distinguishing "we-intentions" from individual intentions.
  Social reality is both objective (independent of individual attitudes)
  and ontologically subjective (dependent on collective attitudes).

  RELEVANCE: Provides the foundational framework for understanding
  tradition as socially constructed yet objectively real. Searle's
  status function account explains how traditions acquire authority
  through collective recognition. His distinction between brute and
  institutional facts illuminates tradition's dependence on collective
  intentionality rather than physical properties. However, leaves open
  questions about temporal persistence and intergenerational transmission
  that are central to tradition.

  POSITION: Establishes social constructionism grounded in collective
  intentionality—most influential account of social ontology for analyzing
  tradition as institutional phenomenon.

@book{gilbert1996living,
  author = {Gilbert, Margaret},
  title = {Living Together: Rationality, Sociality, and Obligation},
  year = {1996},
  publisher = {Rowman \& Littlefield},
  address = {Lanham, MD},
  isbn = {978-0847683154},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gilbert develops "plural subject theory" arguing that
  collective phenomena require joint commitment rather than individual
  intentions. When individuals form a plural subject, they create
  obligations and entitlements that cannot be unilaterally revoked.
  Social practices including traditions are constituted by such joint
  commitments, which bind participants together normatively. Emphasizes
  that collective intentionality involves obligations of joint
  commitment, not mere aggregation of individual attitudes.

  RELEVANCE: Gilbert's plural subject account directly addresses how
  traditions bind participants across time. Joint commitment explains
  tradition's normative force—why members feel obligated to maintain
  practices. Her emphasis on non-reductionism supports viewing tradition
  as having emergent social ontological properties. The concept of joint
  commitment illuminates how traditions persist despite membership
  changes and generational turnover, though Gilbert does not explicitly
  theorize temporal extension.

  POSITION: Plural subject theory—strongest non-reductionist account of
  collective intentionality, essential for understanding tradition's
  binding normative character.

  address = {University Park, PA},
  isbn = {978-0271021898},
  doi = {10.5860/choice.40-3946},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schatzki develops practice-based social ontology arguing
  that social life is organized by practices—embodied, materially
  mediated arrays of human activity. Practices are constituted by
  practical understandings, rules, and teleoaffective structures
  (ends-projects-emotions). Social phenomena are not primarily mental
  states but organized activities. Practices have temporal organization
  and are sites where individual and social intersect.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative to intentionality-based accounts by
  grounding tradition in organized practices rather than collective
  beliefs. Schatzki's framework illuminates how traditions are embodied
  and materially mediated, not just mentally represented. His emphasis on
  practical understanding explains how traditions are transmitted through
  participation rather than explicit instruction. The teleoaffective
  dimension captures tradition's role in organizing purposes and emotions
  across generations. Leaves open questions about how practices acquire
  and maintain identity across transformations.

  POSITION: Practice-based social ontology—most systematic philosophical
  account of social practices, essential for non-mentalist approaches to
  tradition.

  address = {London},
  isbn = {978-0415228145},
  doi = {10.4324/9780203977453},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Edited collection establishing "the practice turn" as
  major reorientation in social theory. Contributors argue that social
  phenomena should be analyzed as practices—organized nexuses of actions
  and sayings. Practices are sites where knowledge, meaning, activity,
  and identity are constituted. Represents move away from structuralism
  and toward understanding social reality through concrete activities.
  Includes contributions from philosophy, sociology, and science studies.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes theoretical foundation for practice-based
  understanding of tradition. Multiple contributors show how practices
  carry meaning across time and constitute social order. Relevant to
  understanding tradition not as static entity but as ongoing
  accomplishment through practice. The volume's interdisciplinary scope
  demonstrates practice theory's applicability across domains. However,
  limited explicit discussion of tradition per se and temporal
  persistence of practices.

  POSITION: Programmatic statement of practice turn in social theory,
  providing conceptual resources for analyzing tradition as organized
  social practice.

  number = {2},
  pages = {174--202},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393103033002002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schatzki articulates "societist" social ontology where
  social phenomena are ontologically distinct from individuals yet not
  substances or structures over and above practices. Social order consists
  of practice-arrangement bundles. Rejects both methodological
  individualism and holism in favor of practice-based emergence. Social
  phenomena are real yet dependent on organized activities.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies ontological status of tradition as neither reducible
  to individuals nor existing as independent entity. Practice-arrangement
  bundles explain how traditions combine organized activities with material
  settings. Schatzki's "societism" provides middle ground between reductive
  and inflationary accounts of tradition's ontological status. Addresses
  how social phenomena persist through temporal extension of practices.

  POSITION: Articulates distinctive middle position on social ontology
  between individualism and holism, applicable to tradition's ontological
  status.

  number = {S1},
  pages = {85--105},
  doi = {10.1111/J.2041-6962.2006.TB00032.X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: List and Pettit develop functionalist account of group
  agency. Groups can be agents when they meet functional criteria:
  representational states, motivational states, and capacity to process
  information and act. Group agency supervenes on but is not reducible to
  individual states. Groups can have attitudes and intentions distinct
  from members' attitudes through aggregation procedures. Argues groups
  are genuine agents capable of belief, desire, and intentional action.

  RELEVANCE: Provides framework for understanding how traditions enable
  collective agency. Groups structured by traditions can have collective
  intentions and responsibilities irreducible to members. Their
  supervenience thesis explains how traditions persist through membership
  changes—collective properties depend on but transcend individual
  properties. However, focus on synchronic groups leaves questions about
  diachronic collective agency across generations that traditions involve.

  POSITION: Functionalist group agency theory—influential account showing
  how collectives can be genuine agents, applicable to tradition-bearing
  groups.

  number = {1},
  pages = {176--193},
  doi = {10.1111/J.1475-4975.2006.00134.X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller develops individualist account of collective
  responsibility compatible with recognizing collective agency. Argues
  that while collective responsibility exists, it ultimately derives from
  individuals' joint actions and institutional roles. Emphasizes
  institutional mechanisms that coordinate individual actions into
  collective outcomes. Collective entities have moral agency when
  individual members act jointly in institutional framework.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates how traditions involve collective responsibility
  for maintaining and transmitting practices. Institutional analysis
  explains how traditions create roles and responsibilities across
  generations. Miller's account shows how individual agents can bear
  responsibility for collective traditions without denying tradition's
  supra-individual character. Relevant to understanding how tradition's
  authority operates through institutionalized individual responsibilities.

  POSITION: Moderate individualist account of collective responsibility,
  offering middle ground between reductive individualism and strong
  collectivism regarding tradition.

  pages = {1787--1818},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-020-02938-z},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Brouwer et al. propose hybrid account integrating
  individual-mode and we-mode collective intentionality. Argues that
  collective phenomena often involve both modes simultaneously rather than
  exclusively one or the other. Develops formal framework combining
  Searle's and Tuomela's approaches. Collective intentions can have both
  individual and irreducibly collective components.

  RELEVANCE: Hybrid account offers nuanced understanding of tradition
  involving both individual commitments and irreducibly collective
  attitudes. Explains how individuals can participate in traditions through
  personal reasons while tradition has collective properties transcending
  individuals. Addresses apparent tension between individual agency and
  collective binding in traditional practices. Recent contribution showing
  continued development of collective intentionality theory.

  POSITION: Integrative hybrid approach attempting to synthesize major
  theories of collective intentionality, applicable to complex structure
  of tradition.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduction to special issue exploring connections
  between collective responsibility and social ontology. Argues that
  questions about collective responsibility presuppose answers to social
  ontological questions about group existence and agency. Different
  conceptions of social ontology yield different accounts of collective
  responsibility. Emphasizes need to integrate normative and ontological
  dimensions of collective phenomena.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes connection between social ontological status of
  traditions and responsibility for maintaining them. Shows that debates
  about traditional authority presuppose social ontological positions.
  Relevant to understanding how traditions impose responsibilities across
  generations. Frames collective responsibility as requiring social
  ontological foundation, directly applicable to tradition's normative
  dimensions.

  POSITION: Programmatic work establishing connection between social
  ontology and collective responsibility, applicable to tradition's
  normative and ontological aspects.

  pages = {5475--5502},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-020-02597-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops formal deontic logic for collective agency,
  exploring what can be expressed about collective obligations and
  collective actions. Examines reducibility questions—whether collective
  deontic concepts reduce to individual ones. Provides formal framework
  for analyzing structure of collective agency and collective obligations.
  Shows limits of expressing collective notions in individual terms.

  RELEVANCE: Formal analysis illuminates logical structure of collective
  aspects of tradition. Addresses whether tradition's collective
  obligations reduce to individual obligations—central question for
  tradition's social ontology. The expressivity results show that some
  collective aspects of tradition cannot be captured by individual-level
  descriptions alone. Provides precise tools for analyzing tradition's
  collective normative structure.

  POSITION: Formal approach to collective agency and obligation,
  demonstrating irreducibility of collective to individual in certain
  contexts, applicable to tradition's structure.

  pages = {141--157},
  doi = {10.1093/OXFORDHB/9780198747871.013.7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how rituals contribute to cultural transmission,
  drawing on cognitive science of religion and memory studies. Argues
  rituals are not just static preservers but active mechanisms generating
  memory and transmission. Distinguishes different modes of religiosity
  (doctrinal vs. imagistic) with distinct transmission mechanisms.
  Proposes model of inheritance systems incorporating actions, artifacts,
  and epigenetics in ritual transmission.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses critical gap in philosophical literature on
  mechanisms of tradition transmission. Shows how ritual practices
  maintain traditions through embodied memory rather than propositional
  content alone. Illuminates material and bodily dimensions of tradition
  often neglected in philosophical accounts. Connects social ontology to
  cognitive mechanisms, though primarily focused on religious traditions.

  POSITION: Cognitive-cultural approach to transmission mechanisms,
  enriching philosophical accounts with empirical insights about how
  traditions are maintained.

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780199646364.003.0006},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Whitehouse applies Waddington's epigenetic landscape
  concept to ritual evolution, explaining how rituals develop and transmit
  cultural patterns. Argues ritual operates at multiple levels:
  cognitive-developmental, social-historical, and biological. Different
  ritual forms (frequent low-arousal vs. rare high-arousal) have distinct
  transmission mechanisms and social effects. Provides evolutionary
  framework for understanding ritual's role in cultural transmission.

  RELEVANCE: Offers scientific perspective on ritual's role in maintaining
  traditions across time. Evolutionary approach illuminates why certain
  transmission mechanisms are stable and effective. Connects social
  ontology of tradition to biological and cognitive substrates. However,
  evolutionary focus may bracket normative questions central to
  philosophical understanding of tradition. Complements philosophical
  accounts with empirical mechanisms.

  POSITION: Evolutionary-cognitive approach to ritual transmission,
  providing empirical grounding for philosophical theories of how
  traditions persist.

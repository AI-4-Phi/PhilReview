This chapter analyses subsidiarity from a historical and theological point of view, starting from Scripture and the Patristic age, through the Middle Ages, and up to contemporary times, with its formulation in the context of the Social Doctrine of the Church. The analysis will then be read in terms of relational ontology and anthropology to show the deep connection of subsidiarity with freedom and gift, not only in moral, but foremost in ontological and syntactic terms, which are essential for interreligious dialogue and cooperation in the post-modern framework.",

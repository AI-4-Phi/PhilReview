## Conclusion

This review has traced how the concept of tradition operates across multiple literatures in political and cultural thought, revealing both productive tensions and significant lacunae. What emerges is neither a unified concept nor mere equivocation, but a family of meanings united by tradition's distinctive claim: that the past exercises normative authority over the present through practices of transmission and continuation.

The definitional landscape spans from Shils's maximally broad conception of tradition as anything transmitted from past to present to Beckstein's (2016) more demanding criteria requiring explicit transmission, claimed continuity, and capacity for authentic development. This conceptual range is not merely terminological; it reflects deeper disagreements about tradition's ontological status—whether traditions are collective intentional states, organized practices, or institutional facts constituted through collective acceptance (Searle 1995; Gilbert 1989). The sharp distinction between tradition and adjacent concepts like custom and convention reveals what is distinctive: traditions claim non-arbitrary authority derived from historical sources, whereas customs operate tacitly and conventions resolve coordination problems without historical grounding.

The central debate organizing this literature concerns tradition's relationship to rational critique. Gadamer's (1989) hermeneutic philosophy demonstrates that understanding is always tradition-constituted—we interpret from within horizons shaped by effective history, such that prejudice enables rather than obstructs genuine understanding. MacIntyre (1988) develops a parallel account of tradition-constituted rationality, arguing that standards of rational justification are internal to traditions while maintaining that traditions can rationally assess themselves through epistemological crises and engage rivals. Against these rehabilitations, Habermas (1990) insists that hermeneutic approaches lack resources for identifying systematically distorted communication and ideological tradition. The question remains unresolved: can critique function without resources external to tradition, or does genuine critique require standing outside the traditions it evaluates?

Neither naive traditionalism nor abstract Enlightenment rationalism proves adequate. The constructivist challenge—that traditions are invented rather than organically continuous (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983)—undermines essentialist accounts without necessarily delegitimating tradition's authority claims. If all traditions involve symbolic reconstruction, then evaluation must proceed on grounds other than authenticity of origins. Meanwhile, the "tradition of post-tradition" (Turner 2021) reveals that critiques of tradition constitute their own authoritative lineages, suggesting we cannot fully escape tradition even in diagnosing its end.

Four interconnected gaps invite integrative theoretical work. First, the social ontology of tradition remains under-theorized: philosophical analyses of collective intentionality rarely address tradition explicitly, while sociological treatments lack rigorous ontological foundations for explaining how traditions persist across generational turnover. Second, non-Western frameworks for understanding tradition's relationship to reason and critique are marginalized; the literature treats Confucian, Islamic, and African intellectual traditions as objects of analysis rather than sources of theory (Getachew and Mantena 2021). Third, the normative implications of constructivism remain unresolved—if all traditions are constructed, what grounds remain for evaluating tradition-based claims? Fourth, frameworks for engaging tradition in pluralist democracies require further development; liberal multiculturalism (Kymlicka 2017) and political pluralism (Muniz-Fraticelli 2014) offer competing approaches without fully resolving how democracies can distinguish legitimate tradition-based claims from those warranting critique.

These gaps are not independent but form a constellation. The ontological question—what kind of thing is a tradition?—informs the normative question—when do traditions deserve authority?—which shapes the political question—how should pluralist democracies engage tradition-based claims? Research addressing these questions could contribute by developing rigorous social ontology of tradition that integrates collective intentionality theory with sociology; engaging non-Western intellectual traditions as sources of theory rather than merely case studies; articulating normative criteria that acknowledge construction while preserving space for evaluation; and proposing democratic frameworks capable of adjudicating among competing tradition-based claims without imposing liberal hegemony or collapsing into relativism. The concept of tradition thus remains contested not because of conceptual confusion, but because it names a persistent problem at the intersection of epistemology, social ontology, and political philosophy—one that contemporary theory has yet to resolve.

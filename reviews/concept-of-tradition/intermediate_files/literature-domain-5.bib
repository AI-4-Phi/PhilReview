====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Sociological theories of tradition span from classical formulations in Weber's
typology of authority to contemporary debates about tradition in late modernity.
Max Weber's conceptualization of traditional authority as one of three ideal types
of legitimate domination established the foundational framework, distinguishing
tradition-oriented action from rational and charismatic forms. Edward Shils
developed the most systematic sociological theory of tradition in his 1981 book,
arguing that tradition involves the transmission of patterns across generations
and constitutes part of the sacred dimension of society. Eric Hobsbawm and Terence
Ranger challenged essentialist accounts through their "invention of tradition"
thesis, demonstrating how apparently ancient traditions are often modern constructs
serving contemporary political purposes. Anthony Giddens analyzed tradition in the
context of reflexive modernization and post-traditional society, arguing that late
modernity involves the detraditionalization of social life while simultaneously
creating new forms of tradition. Recent scholarship examines the continuing role
of tradition in contemporary society, questioning simplistic narratives of
detraditionalization and exploring how tradition operates under conditions of
globalization and reflexivity.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential sociological frameworks for understanding how
traditions are conceptualized, legitimated, maintained, and transformed in modern
societies. Weber's authority typology, Shils's theory of the sacred, Hobsbawm's
constructivist approach, and Giddens's analysis of post-traditional society offer
competing and complementary perspectives crucial for analyzing the concept of
tradition across political philosophy and social theory.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Weber, Shils, and Giddens receive substantial attention, there is less
contemporary engagement with integrating these classical frameworks with recent
developments in practice theory, social ontology, and cultural sociology. The
relationship between sociological and philosophical accounts of tradition remains
undertheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the tensions between essentialist and constructivist
approaches to tradition, the role of reflexivity in modern tradition, and how
sociological theories inform broader philosophical debates about the normative
status of tradition.

KEY_POSITIONS:

  sacred, and contrasted with rational-legal and charismatic forms
- Shils's sacred tradition: 6 papers - Tradition as transmission of sacred
  patterns essential to social integration
- Hobsbawm's invention thesis: 5 papers - Traditions as modern political
  constructs serving legitimation functions

@book{weber1978economy,
  author = {Weber, Max},
  title = {Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology},
  year = {1978},
  publisher = {University of California Press},
  address = {Berkeley},
  editor = {Roth, Guenther and Wittich, Claus},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Weber presents his comprehensive sociology of domination (Herrschaft), distinguishing three pure types of legitimate authority: rational-legal, traditional, and charismatic. Traditional authority rests on belief in the sanctity of age-old rules and powers, with obedience owed to the person who occupies the traditionally sanctioned position of authority. Weber analyzes various forms of traditional authority, from gerontocracy and patriarchalism to patrimonialism and feudalism, showing how each type structures social action and legitimates power through appeals to custom and precedent.

  RELEVANCE: This work provides the foundational sociological framework for understanding tradition as a basis of legitimate authority and social action. Weber's typology remains essential for political philosophy debates about the normative grounds of authority and the tension between tradition and rationalization. His account of traditional action as distinct from value-rational and instrumentally rational action offers crucial conceptual resources for analyzing how tradition operates as both constraint and justification in political life. The work connects directly to debates about whether tradition can provide legitimate grounds for authority in modern societies.

  POSITION: Represents the classical sociological position that tradition constitutes a distinct form of social legitimation based on sacred continuity rather than rational-legal procedures or charismatic breakthrough, while arguing that traditional authority faces increasing pressure from rationalization processes.

@book{shils1981tradition,
  author = {Shils, Edward},
  title = {Tradition},
  year = {1981},
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shils develops the most comprehensive sociological theory of tradition, arguing that tradition involves anything transmitted or handed down from the past to the present and encompasses not just beliefs but practices, institutions, and material objects. He contends that tradition is essential to social order because it connects individuals to the sacred center of society and provides continuity across generations. Tradition is not static but involves selective transmission, modification, and periodic renewal. Shils distinguishes various types of traditions (substantive, personal, primordial) and analyzes institutional bearers of tradition including universities, religious communities, and legal systems.

  RELEVANCE: Shils's work offers the most sustained sociological defense of tradition's continuing importance in modern society, directly challenging narratives of inevitable secularization and detraditionalization. For political philosophy, his account of tradition as inherently connected to the sacred dimension of collective life provides resources for understanding why traditions carry normative weight beyond their instrumental utility. His analysis of how traditions change while maintaining continuity addresses the philosophical problem of whether tradition can accommodate rational criticism and adaptation. The work is essential for debates about whether modern liberal societies can or should maintain traditions.

  POSITION: Represents a conservative-functionalist position arguing that tradition is not merely residual from premodern society but constitutes an essential, continuing basis of social integration and meaning, even (or especially) in modern contexts where it faces challenges from rationalization and individualization.

@book{hobsbawm1983invention,
  author = {Hobsbawm, Eric and Ranger, Terence},
  title = {The Invention of Tradition},
  year = {1983},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9781107295636},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hobsbawm and Ranger demonstrate that many traditions appearing to be ancient are actually of recent origin and often deliberately invented for political purposes. "Invented tradition" refers to practices claiming or appearing to have continuity with the past but actually established through formal or informal repetition and ritual. The authors show how traditions were invented to establish social cohesion, legitimate institutions and authority, and socialize individuals into particular values and behaviors. Case studies include the British monarchy's invented ceremonial, Scottish Highland traditions, and African colonial governance. The work challenges essentialist views that treat traditions as natural or timeless.

  RELEVANCE: This work profoundly influenced debates about tradition by exposing the constructedness of what appear to be primordial customs. For political philosophy, it raises critical questions about whether constructed traditions can legitimately ground political authority or identity. The "invention" thesis challenges conservative arguments appealing to ancient wisdom or organic development, suggesting instead that traditions serve contemporary political interests. However, the work also opens questions about whether all traditions are equally invented and whether invention necessarily delegitimates tradition. Essential for understanding the relationship between tradition, power, and political legitimacy.

  POSITION: Represents a critical-constructivist position that demystifies tradition by revealing its political functions and recent origins, challenging both romantic conservatism and naive appeals to ancient wisdom while raising questions about tradition's epistemic and normative status.

  author = {Hobsbawm, Eric},
  title = {Introduction: Inventing Traditions},
  year = {2012},
  journal = {The Invention of Tradition},
  pages = {1--14},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9781107295636.001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In this introductory essay, Hobsbawm defines "invented tradition" as a set of practices governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rules of a ritual or symbolic nature, seeking to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past. He distinguishes invented tradition from genuine historical tradition and from convention or routine. Hobsbawm argues that invented traditions emerge especially during periods of rapid social transformation when old traditions no longer function and new ones must be created to establish social cohesion, legitimate new institutions, and socialize individuals into changed belief systems.

  RELEVANCE: This essay provides the theoretical framework for the invention of tradition thesis, specifying the conditions under which traditions are deliberately constructed and the social functions they serve. For philosophical analysis of tradition, Hobsbawm's distinction between invented and genuine tradition raises questions about what makes some traditions authentic and others spurious, whether this distinction itself is sustainable, and what normative implications follow from tradition's constructed character. The account connects to debates in political philosophy about the relationship between history, memory, and political legitimacy.

  POSITION: Elaborates the constructivist critique of tradition by showing how apparently ancient practices emerge from modern political needs, while acknowledging that not all traditions are equally invented and that genuine historical continuity exists alongside deliberate innovation.

@book{giddens1991modernity,
  author = {Giddens, Anthony},
  title = {Modernity and Self-Identity: Self and Society in the Late Modern Age},
  year = {1991},
  publisher = {Polity Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Giddens analyzes how late modernity transforms the relationship between self and society through reflexivity, disembedding mechanisms, and the transformation of intimacy. He argues that in late modernity, tradition loses its hold because practices are no longer justified by their pastness but must be reflexively examined and chosen. The self becomes a reflexive project requiring continuous revision in light of new information and possibilities. Trust in abstract systems and expert knowledge replaces trust in tradition and local community. However, tradition doesn't simply disappear but operates differently, becoming something individuals consciously choose to maintain rather than unreflexively follow.

  RELEVANCE: This work fundamentally reframes debates about tradition by showing how reflexivity transforms rather than eliminates tradition's role in modern life. For political philosophy, Giddens's account suggests that tradition can no longer serve as an unreflective basis for authority but must justify itself in terms comprehensible to reflexive agents. His analysis of post-traditional society raises questions about whether chosen traditions can perform the same social functions as inherited ones and whether reflexivity ultimately corrodes or transforms tradition's normative force. Essential for understanding tradition in pluralistic, democratic societies where justification cannot simply appeal to pastness.

  POSITION: Represents a reflexive modernization approach arguing that late modernity involves detraditionalization through increased reflexivity, but tradition persists in transformed ways as individuals and communities consciously choose to maintain certain practices while subjecting them to ongoing critical examination.

@book{beck1994reflexive,
  author = {Beck, Ulrich and Giddens, Anthony and Lash, Scott},
  title = {Reflexive Modernization: Politics, Tradition and Aesthetics in the Modern Social Order},
  year = {1994},
  publisher = {Polity Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.2307/3341775},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The three authors present complementary accounts of reflexive modernization as modernity's confrontation with its own consequences and limitations. Giddens's contribution focuses specifically on tradition in post-traditional society, arguing that tradition becomes open to discursive justification rather than resting on formulaic truth. In dialogic democracy, tradition must engage with other traditions and submit to interrogation. Beck analyzes risk society where traditional certainties dissolve. Lash examines aesthetic reflexivity. Together they argue that reflexive modernization transforms but doesn't eliminate tradition, creating new forms of traditionalism and new relationships between tradition and innovation.

  RELEVANCE: This collaborative work provides the most influential account of how tradition operates under conditions of late modernity and globalization. Giddens's chapters on post-traditional society directly address how tradition can function when it loses its taken-for-granted character and must justify itself dialogically. For political philosophy, this raises questions about whether dialogically defended tradition retains tradition's distinctive character or becomes something else entirely. The work connects to debates about deliberative democracy, multiculturalism, and the possibility of rationally justified tradition that addresses MacIntyre's critique of liberal rationality.

  POSITION: Represents the reflexive modernization school arguing that late modernity involves the radicalization of modernity's own principles, transforming tradition from unreflective inheritance into consciously chosen and dialogically defended practices that must justify themselves in public discourse.

  volume = {37},
  number = {2},
  pages = {139--162},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393107299685},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs provides a comprehensive analysis of Edward Shils's multifaceted theory of tradition, identifying four distinct perspectives within Shils's work: pragmatic (tradition as useful knowledge accumulated over time), Burkean (tradition embodying collective wisdom), veridical (tradition as transmitting truth about reality), and evolutionist (tradition as selected through social evolution). Jacobs shows how Shils synthesizes these perspectives while emphasizing tradition's connection to the sacred and its role in social integration. The article also examines Shils's typology of traditions and his account of institutional bearers.

  RELEVANCE: This article is essential for understanding the most systematic sociological theory of tradition and its internal complexities. Jacobs's identification of multiple strands within Shils's thought helps explain both the richness and tensions in Shils's account. For political philosophy, the article illuminates how sociological defenses of tradition can draw on various normative and epistemological commitments, from pragmatist to conservative to realist grounds. Understanding Shils's framework is crucial for evaluating whether tradition can provide rational justification for practices beyond appeals to mere pastness or authority.

  POSITION: Explicates and systematizes Shils's position that tradition is essential to social order, connecting individuals to sacred centers and transmitting valuable knowledge, while showing the multiple theoretical foundations underlying this conservative-functionalist stance.

@article{rust2018traditional,

  title = {Traditional Action and Traditional Authority},
  year = {2018},
  journal = {Max Weber Studies},
  volume = {18},
  number = {2},
  pages = {159--185},
  doi = {10.1353/max.2018.0000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rust challenges standard interpretations of Weber's concept of traditional action, arguing it is neither merely habitual nor value-rational but involves subjectively meaningful behavior rendered intelligible through shared exemplars and precedents found in "documents of tradition." Traditional action has its own form of rationality based on appeal to authoritative examples rather than calculation or adherence to abstract principles. Rust extends this analysis to Weber's account of traditional authority, showing how the master's legitimacy derives from exemplars and precedents rather than just rules. This interpretation reveals important limits to standard models of social ontology that privilege rule-following.

  RELEVANCE: This article significantly refines our understanding of Weber's account of tradition, showing that traditional action involves a distinctive form of practical reasoning rather than unreflective habit. For political philosophy, Rust's analysis suggests that tradition provides a form of justification through exemplars that cannot be reduced to either instrumental rationality or deontological principle-following. This has implications for debates about practical reason, the sources of normativity, and whether tradition can ground rational action. The article also challenges social ontologies based solely on constitutive rules, suggesting traditional statuses involve exemplar-based practices.

  POSITION: Develops a sophisticated interpretation of Weberian traditional authority showing how tradition operates through exemplars and precedents, offering a form of practical rationality distinct from both instrumental calculation and value-rationality, thereby defending tradition's epistemic credentials.

  number = {4},
  pages = {312--342},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393120986244},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rust argues that Weber's typology of legitimate authority reveals limitations in Searle's "Standard Model" of social ontology. While Searle's account of status functions and constitutive rules accurately describes legal-rational authority, it fails to capture traditional and charismatic forms. Traditional authority doesn't rest primarily on rules but on exemplars, precedents, and the "documents of tradition." Searle's universalist claim that he has provided "the structure of human civilization" actually describes only one way of being a civilization—the modern, rational-legal form—while obscuring how traditional societies and informal social statuses actually function.

  RELEVANCE: This article is crucial for connecting sociological theories of tradition to contemporary debates in social ontology and philosophy of social science. Rust shows that if Weber's typology is correct, then influential philosophical accounts of social reality are incomplete or parochial, designed to explain modern legal-rational societies but inadequate for understanding tradition-based social orders. For political philosophy, this suggests that theories of authority, legitimacy, and political obligation may need to recognize fundamentally different forms of social constitution beyond rule-following and status functions. The article challenges the universalist pretensions of much analytic social philosophy.

  POSITION: Uses Weber's authority typology to critique contemporary social ontology, arguing that traditional authority operates through exemplars and precedents rather than constitutive rules, revealing limits of rule-based accounts of social reality.

  volume = {45},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--24},
  doi = {10.1007/S11186-015-9263-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Szelenyi applies Weber's theory of domination to analyze post-communist societies, arguing that Weber actually identified four rather than three types: the standard legal-rational, traditional, and charismatic types, plus a fourth called "Wille der Beherrschten" (will of the dominated). The article also distinguishes between patrimonial and prebendal forms of traditional authority. Analyzing legitimation in communist and post-communist regimes, Szelenyi shows how various forms of authority combine and compete, with some post-communist systems developing illiberal, prebendal quasi-democratic structures that blend legal forms with traditional and personal loyalties.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates the continuing relevance of Weberian authority theory for understanding contemporary political systems, including how traditional forms persist or reemerge in ostensibly modern contexts. For political philosophy, Szelenyi's analysis shows that the relationship between tradition and modern legal-rational authority is more complex than simple succession or replacement narratives suggest. Traditional and patrimonial elements can be reasserted within formally legal-rational structures, raising questions about whether modern institutions truly transcend tradition or merely reconfigure it. The article is valuable for understanding tradition's role in contemporary authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.

  POSITION: Extends Weber's framework to show how traditional forms of authority (particularly patrimonialism and prebendalism) persist and combine with legal-rational structures in post-communist contexts, demonstrating tradition's ongoing political salience beyond simple modernization narratives.

  number = {2},
  pages = {125--145},
  doi = {10.1111/0735-2751.00072},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Turner assesses Edward Shils's contributions to sociology, arguing that while Shils developed important insights about tradition, charisma, intellectuals, and the sacred, his work resisted systematization and often stood against prevailing sociological trends. Shils emphasized consensual elements in society when conflict theory dominated, defended tradition when modernization theory predicted its demise, and analyzed the sacred in increasingly secular academic contexts. Turner shows how Shils's insistence on tradition's continuing importance, even in modern societies, challenged both functionalist and critical paradigms in sociology.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides essential context for understanding Shils's theory of tradition within broader developments in sociological theory. Turner's analysis helps explain why Shils's defense of tradition, despite its sophistication, remained marginal to mainstream sociology dominated by modernization and secularization narratives. For political philosophy, the article illuminates the tensions between sociological accounts emphasizing tradition's decline and those, like Shils's, arguing for its persistence and necessity. Understanding these sociological debates is crucial for assessing whether philosophical defenses of tradition face empirical challenges from social science.

  POSITION: Evaluates Shils as a major but underappreciated sociological theorist whose defense of tradition's continuing significance challenged dominant narratives of modernization, secularization, and rationalization, while acknowledging limitations in his systematic theorization.

  volume = {97},
  number = {385},
  pages = {273--290},
  doi = {10.2307/540610},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Handler and Linnekin argue against the essentialist view that divides traditions into genuine (authentic, ancient, continuously transmitted) and spurious (invented, recent, contrived) categories. Drawing on symbolic anthropology, they contend that all tradition is symbolically constructed in the present through selective interpretation of the past. What appears as continuity always involves creative reinterpretation. Authenticity is itself a symbolic concept used within traditions rather than an objective criterion for evaluating them. The authors show how even "authentic" traditions undergo continuous reconstruction as they are transmitted and adapted.

  RELEVANCE: This article represents an important anthropological contribution to debates about tradition's authenticity and construction. For political philosophy, it challenges binary oppositions between genuine and invented tradition, suggesting instead that all traditions involve ongoing symbolic construction and reinterpretation. This raises difficult questions for political theories that depend on distinguishing legitimate traditional authority from spurious appeals to fabricated histories. However, the article's radical constructivism may overcorrect by making it impossible to distinguish between traditions with genuine historical depth and recently created practices, potentially undermining normative assessments of tradition.

  POSITION: Advances a symbolic-constructivist position arguing that the genuine/spurious distinction cannot be maintained because all traditions involve continuous symbolic reconstruction in the present, challenging both essentialist and simple invention theses.

  volume = {39},
  number = {3},
  pages = {5--28},
  doi = {10.5840/TRADDISC2012/201339338},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Moodey traces how Edward Shils and Michael Polanyi moved beyond Parsons and Shils's earlier "Action Frame of Reference" to develop more nuanced accounts of tradition's role in human action. Both came to see that methodological individualism and the pattern variables framework inadequately captured how tradition structures and enables meaningful action. They developed accounts showing tradition as not merely constraining but as providing the tacit framework making purposive action possible, connecting individuals to communities and to sources of meaning that cannot be reduced to individual choice or instrumental rationality.

  RELEVANCE: This article illuminates important developments in mid-century social theory regarding how tradition relates to agency and rationality. For political philosophy, Moodey's account shows how sophisticated theorists moved beyond seeing tradition merely as irrational constraint to understanding it as enabling condition for rational action. This connects to debates about whether tradition and rational autonomy are opposed or complementary, and whether liberal theory requires or excludes traditional frameworks. The article is particularly valuable for understanding how defenses of tradition can be compatible with acknowledging human agency and purposive action.

  POSITION: Explicates Shils's and Polanyi's evolution toward viewing tradition as an enabling framework for rational action rather than its obstacle, challenging both methodological individualism and simple opposition between tradition and rationality.

  number = {3},
  pages = {38--42},
  doi = {10.5840/TRADDISC2012/201339340},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grosby responds to Moodey's article by emphasizing that while Shils and Polanyi advanced understanding of tradition's role in action, they built on Weber's recognition that tradition persists even in modern rationalized societies. Weber already recognized tradition's ongoing significance in law and religion despite rationalization pressures. Grosby argues that the crucial insight from Shils and Polanyi is that traditions necessarily persist because they provide frameworks for meaning and action that cannot be entirely replaced by instrumental rationality, even in modern conditions of globalization.

  RELEVANCE: This brief commentary helps situate Shils's and Polanyi's contributions in relation to Weber's foundational work and contemporary issues. For political philosophy, Grosby's emphasis on tradition's necessity even under modern conditions challenges simplistic progress narratives and supports the view that political orders cannot function solely on instrumental or procedural rationality. The piece connects sociological insights about tradition to broader questions in political theory about the sources of meaning, solidarity, and legitimate authority in pluralistic modern societies.

  POSITION: Emphasizes continuity from Weber through Shils and Polanyi in recognizing tradition's necessary and ongoing role even in modern rationalized societies, countering narratives of inevitable secularization and detraditionalization.

  number = {1},
  pages = {3--29},
  doi = {10.1017/S0010417500018247},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Deringil applies Hobsbawm and Ranger's "invention of tradition" framework to the late Ottoman Empire, showing how Ottoman rulers deliberately created new ceremonies, symbols, and historical narratives while claiming ancient precedent. These invented traditions aimed to bolster legitimacy, create loyalty, and project modern statehood while maintaining Islamic credentials. The article demonstrates how tradition invention served modernization projects, with rulers using supposedly ancient practices to justify contemporary reforms and centralization. This revealed the paradox of using tradition to legitimate anti-traditional changes.

  RELEVANCE: This historical case study demonstrates the practical application and utility of the invention of tradition thesis for understanding how political actors strategically deploy tradition. For political philosophy, it provides concrete evidence of how appeals to tradition can mask innovation and serve contemporary political purposes rather than preserving genuine continuity. The Ottoman case is particularly valuable because it shows how even in ostensibly traditional societies, rulers consciously manufactured traditions to achieve modern state-building goals, raising questions about when and whether tradition can provide non-instrumental grounds for authority and legitimacy.

  POSITION: Applies Hobsbawm's invention thesis to show how late Ottoman elites deliberately created traditions to legitimate modernizing reforms, demonstrating that tradition invention is not unique to European nationalism but a widespread state-building strategy.

  title = {Tradition and Agency: Tracing Cultural Continuity and Invention},
  year = {2005},
  publisher = {Aarhus University Press},
  address = {Aarhus},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Otto and Pedersen seek to move beyond the polarized debate between essentialist and constructivist approaches to tradition by developing a framework recognizing both cultural continuity and inventive agency. They argue that traditions involve genuine transmission of practices and meanings while also undergoing continuous modification through agents' creative appropriation and adaptation. The volume examines various cases showing how tradition and innovation interrelate, with agents drawing on received cultural resources to address new circumstances. Neither pure continuity nor pure invention adequately captures how tradition actually operates.

  RELEVANCE: This edited volume represents an important attempt to synthesize insights from both sides of the tradition debates. For political philosophy, the framework suggests that arguments about tradition need not choose between viewing it as static inheritance or pure construction, but can recognize both dimensions. This has implications for assessing tradition's normative force: traditions can embody accumulated wisdom (genuine transmission) while also reflecting power relations and strategic choices (invention). The work provides conceptual resources for avoiding false dichotomies in debates about tradition's role in political justification.

  POSITION: Proposes a synthetic approach recognizing both genuine cultural continuity and inventive agency in tradition, avoiding the extremes of essentialism and radical constructivism while acknowledging the complex interplay between transmission and innovation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume comprehensively examines Edward Shils's contributions to social thought, including his theories of tradition, intellectuals, civil society, and the sacred. Contributors analyze Shils's insistence on society's consensual elements and sacred dimensions even in secular modernity, his conflicts with value-free sociology, and his defense of tradition against modernization narratives. The volume places Shils's work in conversation with figures like Weber, Durkheim, and Parsons while assessing his continuing relevance for understanding contemporary social and political issues.

  RELEVANCE: This collection provides the most comprehensive recent treatment of Shils's social thought and its continuing significance. For political philosophy, the volume demonstrates how Shils's sociological defense of tradition connects to broader questions about meaning, solidarity, and legitimate authority in modern societies. Multiple chapters explore how Shils's account of tradition as sacred and consensual relates to political theory debates about liberalism, conservatism, and communitarianism. Essential for understanding the most systematic sociological theory of tradition and its philosophical implications.

  POSITION: Recovers and evaluates Shils's distinctive contribution to social thought, particularly his defense of tradition's continuing necessity in modern society through its connection to the sacred and its role in social integration, positioning him as an important but underappreciated theorist.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Breuer provides a comprehensive analysis of Weber's sociology of domination (Herrschaft), clarifying the relationship between domination and power, and explaining the three pure types of legal, traditional, and charismatic domination along with their organizational structures. He shows how Weber's framework remains relevant for analyzing contemporary forms of domination, including tendencies toward weakening legal formalism and the emergence of new forms of charismatic and traditional authority. The article addresses common misinterpretations and demonstrates the framework's continued applicability across diverse scientific and cultural research fields.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides authoritative clarification of Weber's domination typology and demonstrates its continuing value for political analysis. For political philosophy, Breuer's analysis shows how Weber's framework can illuminate contemporary phenomena including populism, personalistic leadership, and the reassertion of traditional forms of legitimation within ostensibly modern political systems. The article helps political theorists avoid misusing Weber's concepts while drawing on the framework's insights about different bases of legitimate authority and their relationship to freedom, equality, and rationality.

  POSITION: Systematically explicates Weber's domination typology while defending its continuing relevance for analyzing both modern and contemporary forms of political authority, showing how the framework can illuminate current challenges to legal-rational domination.

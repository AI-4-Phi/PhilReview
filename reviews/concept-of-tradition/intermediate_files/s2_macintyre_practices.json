      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper explores the relationship between two aspects of the social and political thought of Alasdair MacIntyre. The first is what MacIntyre has to say about the politics of social institutions, especially the distinction which MacIntyre makes in After Virtue between practices and institutions. The second is MacIntyre\u2019s views regarding utopianism in politics. I argue that MacIntyre\u2019s assessment of the merits and demerits of utopianism in politics has changed significantly between the publication of After Virtue in 1981 and the publication of Ethics in the Conflicts of Modernity in 2016. From being a pessimistic critic of utopianism in politics (\u201cutopianism of the future\u201d), MacIntyre has come to support a specific form of utopianism, which he has called \u201cutopianism of the present,\u201d but which might better be described as \u201crealistic utopianism.\u201d This form of utopianism is practical and small-scale. It focuses on the institutions of civil society rather than on the state, or on an attempt to initiate large-scale social and political transformation of society as a whole, of the kind that is traditionally associated with radical politics. MacIntyre\u2019s most recent views might also, therefore, be associated with the idea of prefigurative utopianism, as this is understood by scholars who work in the area of utopian studies.",

      "abstract": "Initiatives intended to support and advance the scholarship of teaching have become common in Canada as well as internationally. Nonetheless, the notion of a scholarship of teaching remains contested and has been described as under-theorized. In this conceptual study, I contribute to the ongoing \u201ctheory debate\u201d in the scholarship of teaching, applying a philosophical lens. I propose that Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s account of \u201cpractices,\u201d including concepts of virtue, standards of excellence, internal goods, and transformation, offers a useful theoretical framework by which to identify the nature and defend the purposes and desired outcomes of this domain of scholarship. I argue that the moral virtues of justice, courage, and truthfulness, identified by MacIntyre as fundamental to all social practices, are essential also for meaningful engagement in the practice of the scholarship of teaching, but that two additional and overarching virtues are needed: authenticity and phronesis.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the adoption of moral philosophy and in particular normative ethics, to clarify the concept of \u201cgood\u201d evaluation of \u201cresearch practices\u201d. Using MacIntyre (1985)\u2019s notion of a practice we argue that research is a form of social practice. As a result of this characterization, we claim that research practice typically requires three typologies of researcher: the leader, the good researcher and the honest researcher. Reflecting on what is a \u201cgood\u201d research practice and on what is the role of researchers in it provides insight into some aspects of both the self-assessment process and how this promotes individual improvement. Moreover, this kind of reflection helps us to describe the functions (missions) of the research practices. A \u201cgood\u201d evaluation should take into account all the building constituents of a \u201cgood\u201d research practice and should be able to discriminate between good and bad research practices, while enforcing the functions of good research practices. We believe that these reflections may be the starting point for a paradigm shift in the evaluation of research practices which replaces an evaluation centred on products with an evaluation focused on the functions of these practices. In the last sections of the paper, we introduce and discuss an important aspect for the implementation of the proposed framework. This relates to the assessment of the virtues of researchers involved in a good research practice. Some examples of questions and preliminary items to include in a questionnaire for the assessment of Virtues in Research Practices are also provided.",

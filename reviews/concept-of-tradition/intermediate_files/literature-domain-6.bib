====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The tradition-modernity debates represent one of the most significant theoretical and empirical discussions in social theory since the mid-20th century. Classical modernization theory, dominant from the 1950s-1970s, posited a linear trajectory whereby traditional societies would inevitably give way to modern ones, characterized by secularization, rationalization, and the decline of traditional forms of authority and community. This paradigm was fundamentally challenged beginning in the 1980s-1990s by three major theoretical developments: (1) the reflexive modernization thesis of Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens, which argued that modernity itself becomes tradition-like under conditions of reflexivity; (2) the multiple modernities framework of Shmuel Eisenstadt, which demonstrated that non-Western societies develop distinct forms of modernity that incorporate rather than replace traditional elements; and (3) postmodern and postcolonial critiques that rejected the tradition-modernity binary altogether as a product of Eurocentric thinking.

The secularization thesis—a core component of classical modernization theory—predicted the inevitable decline of religion with modernization. However, empirical research since the 1990s has comprehensively challenged this prediction, showing persistent religiosity in modern societies and even religious resurgence in some contexts. This has led to theories of "post-secular society" (Habermas) and recognition that secularization patterns vary significantly across different societal contexts.

Recent scholarship emphasizes the dialectical and contested nature of tradition-modernity relations. Rather than a simple displacement, contemporary analyses focus on: how traditions are reinvented and mobilized in modern contexts; how "post-traditional" societies retain traditional elements in transformed ways; how globalization creates new tensions between local traditions and global modernizing forces; and how the very categories of "tradition" and "modernity" are themselves contested and culturally specific. The debate has moved from essentialist characterizations to processual and relational understandings of both concepts.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is directly relevant to understanding how "tradition" itself is conceptualized in relation to its putative opposite, "modernity." The debates reveal that tradition cannot be understood as a static residue of the past but must be grasped in dynamic relation to processes of social change, modernization, and globalization. This challenges any attempt to define tradition in isolation from its historical and sociological context.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive literature on Western European and North American cases, and growing work on Asian contexts (especially through the multiple modernities framework), there remains relatively limited philosophical engagement with how these sociological debates should inform normative political philosophy. Additionally, the literature would benefit from more systematic engagement with how digital technologies and climate change are reshaping tradition-modernity dynamics.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the shift from unilinear modernization narratives to more complex, plural, and dialectical understandings of tradition-modernity relations. Key to this is showing how reflexive modernization, multiple modernities, and postcolonial critiques each challenge but also complement one another. The persistence of tradition in modernity—whether as revival, reinvention, or transformation—should be understood as a central rather than anomalous feature of contemporary societies.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Reflexive Modernization (Beck, Giddens, Lash): 12 papers - Modernity becomes self-reflexive, creating "post-traditional" societies where tradition persists in transformed, chosen forms
- Multiple Modernities (Eisenstadt): 4 papers - Non-Western societies develop distinct modernities incorporating traditional elements rather than converging on Western model
- Secularization Critique: 8 papers - Empirical challenges to secularization thesis showing persistence and transformation of religion in modern societies
- Postcolonial Critique: 3 papers - Rejection of tradition-modernity binary as Eurocentric construction

@book{beck1994reflexive,
  author = {Beck, Ulrich and Giddens, Anthony and Lash, Scott},
  title = {Reflexive Modernization: Politics, Tradition and Aesthetics in the Modern Social Order},
  year = {1994},
  publisher = {Polity Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This foundational text argues that late modernity is characterized by "reflexive modernization"—a process whereby the achievements and institutions of industrial modernity (the welfare state, nuclear family, occupational system) become problematized and transformed by modernity's own dynamism. Beck emphasizes the emergence of "risk society" where manufactured uncertainties dominate; Giddens analyzes the "post-traditional" society where traditions lose their taken-for-granted character and must be explicitly chosen and justified; Lash explores "reflexive aestheticization" of social life. The key claim is that modernity does not simply displace tradition but creates new forms of traditionality and new modes of relating to tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This work fundamentally reframes the tradition-modernity debate by showing that "post-traditional" society is not traditionless but relates to tradition in a qualitatively different way—through reflexive choice rather than unreflective acceptance. This is crucial for understanding how tradition functions in contemporary political philosophy, where appeals to tradition must be explicitly defended rather than merely assumed. The concept of "reflexive modernization" helps explain how traditions can be simultaneously weakened (as unquestioned authorities) and strengthened (as consciously chosen identities).

  POSITION: Represents the reflexive modernization thesis, which occupies a middle ground between classical modernization theory (predicting tradition's disappearance) and communitarian defenses of tradition (treating it as stable and given). Highly influential across sociology, political theory, and social philosophy.

  title = {The Theory of Reflexive Modernization: Problematic, Hypotheses and Research Programme},
  journal = {Theory, Culture \& Society},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {20},
  number = {2},
  pages = {1--33},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276403020002001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This programmatic statement elaborates and defends the theory of reflexive modernization against critics. The authors distinguish between three types of modernization: simple modernization (tradition to industrial modernity), reflexive modernization (industrial modernity to risk society), and normative modernization (political projects of modernity). They argue that reflexive modernization involves unintended consequences and side effects of industrial modernization that undermine its own foundations, leading to "individualization," "globalization," and the transformation of politics into "subpolitics." Crucially, they emphasize that reflexivity is not primarily cognitive but structural—modernization reflexively transforms its own conditions.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides crucial conceptual clarification of reflexive modernization theory, distinguishing it from postmodernism and showing its continued commitment to Enlightenment ideals. For tradition studies, it demonstrates how traditions are not simply eliminated but "disembedded" and "re-embedded" in new institutional contexts. The concept of "individualization" is particularly important for understanding how traditional community forms give way to choice-based associations, yet how this very process creates new dependencies and new forms of tradition.

  POSITION: Represents a developed statement of the reflexive modernization research program, showing its evolution beyond the 1994 book and responding to various critiques.

@article{eisenstadt2000multiple,
  author = {Eisenstadt, Shmuel N.},
  title = {Multiple Modernities},
  journal = {Daedalus},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {129},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--29},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Eisenstadt challenges the classical assumption that modernization necessarily leads to convergence on a Western model, instead proposing that there are "multiple modernities"—distinct patterns of modernity shaped by different cultural programs and civilizational backgrounds. He argues that while modernity originated in the West, its crystallization in different societies has been shaped by specific cultural premises and historical experiences, particularly religious traditions (Christian, Islamic, Confucian, Hindu, Buddhist). These cultural programs are not merely "traditional residues" but actively shape the institutional contours of modernity. The pattern of Western modernity is thus one among many possible patterns, not a universal template.

  RELEVANCE: This framework fundamentally challenges the tradition-modernity binary by showing that "tradition" (understood as civilizational and cultural programs) does not disappear with modernization but rather shapes the specific form that modernity takes in different contexts. For political philosophy, this implies that appeals to tradition cannot be dismissed as inherently anti-modern, nor can modern political institutions be understood in abstraction from their civilizational contexts. The multiple modernities framework also challenges Eurocentric assumptions that have dominated both modernization theory and much political theory.

  POSITION: Represents the multiple modernities paradigm, which has become highly influential in comparative sociology, historical sociology, and area studies. Offers an alternative to both classical modernization theory and postmodern rejection of modernity.

@book{fox2008world,
  author = {Fox, Jonathan},
  title = {A World Survey of Religion and the State},
  year = {2008},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511993039},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Based on comprehensive quantitative analysis of 175 governments worldwide from 1990-2002, Fox demonstrates that government involvement in religion is ubiquitous and increased during this period. Only a minority of states—including a minority of democracies—maintain separation of religion and state. The book documents four forms of government involvement: official state religions, preferential treatment of some religions, religious discrimination against minorities, and religious legislation. These findings directly contradict predictions of modernization and secularization theory, which expected religion's public role to decline with development.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical work provides crucial evidence against the secularization thesis, a core component of classical modernization theory that predicted religion would decline with modernization. The persistence and even growth of government-religion entanglement challenges simplistic narratives of tradition (religion) giving way to modernity (secular rationality). For political philosophy, it demonstrates that normative theories must grapple with the empirical reality that most modern states do not conform to strict church-state separation. The data shows tradition-modernity relations are far more complex than linear displacement models suggest.

  POSITION: Represents empirical challenge to secularization theory within the sociology of religion, showing through cross-national quantitative data that modernization does not necessarily lead to religious decline or privatization.

@article{casanova2011cosmopolitanism,
  author = {Casanova, Jos\'{e}},
  title = {Cosmopolitanism, the Clash of Civilizations and Multiple Modernities},
  journal = {Current Sociology},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {59},
  number = {2},
  pages = {252--267},
  doi = {10.1177/0011392110391162},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Casanova examines three alternative frameworks for understanding global order: cosmopolitanism (based on theories of universal secular modernization), Huntington's "clash of civilizations" (emphasizing permanent incompatibility between civilization-based modernities), and Eisenstadt's "multiple modernities" (recognizing different civilizational paths to modernity). He argues that cosmopolitan theories, while universalist, remain tied to secularist assumptions that view resistant religions as dangerous fundamentalism. The multiple modernities framework offers a superior alternative by recognizing the continuing relevance of world religions while avoiding Huntington's essentialist civilizational determinism.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis helps situate debates about tradition and modernity within broader frameworks of global theory. It shows how different theoretical approaches to modernity carry different normative implications for how we understand and evaluate traditional (especially religious) claims in modern societies. For political philosophy, it suggests that neither secular universalism nor civilizational particularism adequately captures the complex relationship between traditional religious identities and modern political forms. The article demonstrates the continuing salience of religious traditions in shaping modern political orders.

  POSITION: Builds on multiple modernities framework while engaging with debates about secularization, cosmopolitanism, and civilizational analysis. Represents sophisticated sociological approach to religion in modern societies.

@article{pollack2007religious,
  author = {Pollack, Detlef and Pickel, Gert},
  title = {Religious Individualization or Secularization? Testing Hypotheses of Religious Change—The Case of Eastern and Western Germany},
  journal = {British Journal of Sociology},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {58},
  number = {4},
  pages = {603--632},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1468-4446.2007.00168.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using 50 years of German data, Pollack and Pickel test two competing theories of religious change: the secularization thesis (modernization leads to religious decline) and the individualization thesis (traditional institutionalized religion is replaced by subjective, non-church spirituality). They find that individualized non-church religiosity remains marginal and is interwoven with traditional Christian religiosity rather than replacing it. The rise of individualized religion cannot compensate for losses in institutional religiosity. They conclude that religious individualization is only a component within a predominant secularization process, not an alternative to it.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical study provides crucial nuance to debates about tradition and modernity by showing that the transformation of tradition takes specific forms that vary by context. While it supports secularization in the German case, it demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of religious change (decline vs. transformation vs. privatization). For political philosophy, it suggests that claims about tradition's "persistence" must specify what form that persistence takes—individualized spiritual seeking is qualitatively different from traditional institutional religiosity and has different political implications.

  POSITION: Represents careful empirical sociology of religion that tests competing theoretical frameworks. Supports secularization theory over individualization theory for the German case while acknowledging regional variation.

  author = {Pollack, Detlef and Rosta, Gergely},
  title = {Religion and Modernity: An International Comparison},
  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198801665.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive comparative study examines religious change in Western and Eastern Europe, the United States, South Korea, Poland, Russia, and the spread of Pentecostalism in Europe, the US, and Brazil. Against recent scholarly skepticism about secularization theory, Pollack and Rosta argue that modernization processes—particularly functional differentiation, individualization, and pluralization—do inhibit religious participation and belief, even in cases often cited as counterexamples (Poland, Russia, USA, South Korea). They show that these societies display clear signs of religious decline when examined carefully, supporting a revised secularization thesis.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the most comprehensive recent empirical investigations of the secularization thesis, directly addressing the tradition-modernity relationship through the lens of religion. By examining diverse cases (not just Western Europe), it tests whether modernity necessarily undermines tradition. The finding that even seemingly religious modern societies show signs of decline suggests that the tension between modernity and (religious) tradition may be deeper than multiple modernities theorists acknowledge. For political philosophy, it raises difficult questions about whether appeals to religious tradition can remain viable in modern pluralistic societies undergoing these structural transformations.

  POSITION: Represents sophisticated neo-secularization theory that responds to critiques while defending core insights about modernization's effects on religion. Important empirical contribution to debates about modernity and tradition.

  title = {Conjugating the Modern/Religious, Conceptualizing Female Religious Agency: Contours of a 'Post-Secular' Conjuncture},
  journal = {Theory, Culture \& Society},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {25},
  number = {6},
  pages = {51--67},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276408095544},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bracke examines how young Evangelical and Islamic women in the Netherlands articulate faith-centered perspectives that incorporate and produce modernity rather than opposing it. She argues for rethinking the modern-secular and religious-traditional binaries that structure much social theory. Drawing on ethnographic research, she shows how these women construct a "pious modern" that challenges assumptions linking modernization with secularization. This requires reconceptualizing both agency and subjectivity beyond secular assumptions embedded in feminist and critical theory. The "post-secular" marks a new disarticulation between the modern and the secular.

  RELEVANCE: This article challenges the assumption that tradition (especially religious tradition) is necessarily opposed to or undermined by modernity. Instead, it shows how religious actors actively construct modern identities and practices from within religious frameworks. For political philosophy, this problematizes any theory that treats tradition and modernity as mutually exclusive or that assumes modern political participation requires secularization. The concept of "pious modernity" suggests that tradition and modernity can be conjugated in ways that neither classical modernization theory nor communitarian tradition-defense anticipated.

  POSITION: Represents feminist post-secular scholarship that challenges both secularization theory and secular assumptions in critical theory. Draws on ethnographic research to rethink theoretical categories.

  journal = {The Historical Journal},

  volume = {55},
  number = {1},
  pages = {161--194},
  doi = {10.1017/s0018246x11000586},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This historiographical review demonstrates that historical research across multiple periods and themes has produced findings radically inconsistent with the sociological secularization thesis. Clark argues that the secularization model—which located the beginnings of secularization in early modernity and saw its completion in the 19th-20th centuries—is finally untenable. He proposes a broader, more historical conception of "religion" that can accommodate both persistent religiosity and undoubted changes in religious behavior. The article shows how an older historical scenario linking early modern rationalization to eventual religious decline fails to match empirical evidence.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides crucial historical perspective on the secularization thesis, showing that what appeared as a coherent "grand narrative" from a mid-20th century sociological vantage point collapses when confronted with detailed historical evidence. For understanding tradition and modernity, this suggests that the very periodization underlying modernization theory (a transition from "traditional" to "modern" society) may be historiographically flawed. It demonstrates the importance of empirical historical research for evaluating theoretical claims about tradition-modernity relations.

  POSITION: Represents historical critique of sociological secularization theory from within historical scholarship. Part of broader "religious turn" in historiography that challenges earlier narratives of inevitable secularization.

@article{woodhead2008gendering,

  title = {Gendering Secularization Theory},
  journal = {Social Compass},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {55},
  number = {2},
  pages = {187--193},
  doi = {10.1177/0037768607089738},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Woodhead argues that secularization theory successfully explains male disaffiliation from Christianity following industrialization but ignores women's different experience of modernization. While men moved into paid labor outside the home, women remained responsible for unpaid care work within it. Women's entrance into paid labor since the 1960s has not relieved them of traditional care duties. Women's patterns of religious affiliation and disaffiliation are best understood in relation to their working lives and their negotiation between domestic employment and paid labor. Taking gender seriously reveals both strengths and limitations of secularization theory.

  RELEVANCE: This gendered analysis reveals that the tradition-modernity transition was experienced differently by men and women, challenging universal narratives of secularization and modernization. It demonstrates that "tradition" (here, traditional gender roles and religious participation) persists and transforms in gendered ways that standard modernization theories miss. For political philosophy, this suggests that any adequate account of tradition must attend to how it is gendered and how gender shapes both the preservation and transformation of traditional practices. The article shows the importance of intersectional analysis for understanding tradition-modernity relations.

  POSITION: Represents feminist sociology of religion that both engages with and critiques secularization theory by introducing gender as a central analytical category.

  number = {2},
  pages = {248--266},
  doi = {10.1080/13688790.2024.2304472},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: George examines how Ashis Nandy and other postcolonial scholars constructed tradition and modernity as antagonistic, viewing modernity as a colonial imposition. Against this, she presents Ambedkarite scholarship showing how B.R. Ambedkar synthesized tradition and modernity, incorporating modern liberalism's promise of individual liberation while not dismissing the communal collective self constructed by traditions. The article questions whether postcolonial theory's anxiety about modernity prevents it from claiming modernity's emancipatory potential. Ambedkar demonstrates a middle ground between rejecting modernity as colonial and accepting it uncritically.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates how the tradition-modernity binary itself can be a product of colonial power relations and how postcolonial critiques sometimes over-correct by romanticizing tradition. Ambedkar's position—embracing modernity's emancipatory dimensions while criticizing oppressive traditional hierarchies (caste)—offers an alternative to both modernization theory and anti-modern postcolonialism. For political philosophy, this suggests that tradition and modernity need not be antagonistic and that the binary itself may obscure more complex possibilities for synthesis. The Ambedkarite position shows how subordinated groups may have strong reasons to embrace aspects of modernity against oppressive traditions.

  POSITION: Represents postcolonial and Dalit political thought that critiques both colonial modernity and oppressive traditional hierarchies, seeking a synthetic position.

@book{gyekye1997tradition,
  author = {Gyekye, Kwame},
  title = {Tradition and Modernity: Philosophical Reflections on the African Experience},
  year = {1997},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gyekye offers a philosophical interpretation of the African cultural experience in relation to tradition and modernity. He argues against both uncritical embrace of Western modernity and romanticized defense of African tradition. Instead, he proposes a critical approach that evaluates both traditional and modern elements based on their contribution to human flourishing. Gyekye addresses concrete problems in postcolonial African states: ethnicity and nation-building, the relationship of tradition to modernity, political authority and legitimation, corruption, and threats to traditional values from rapid social change. He advocates for selective retention of valuable traditional practices while embracing beneficial modern innovations.

  RELEVANCE: This work exemplifies philosophical engagement with tradition-modernity relations from a non-Western perspective, showing how the debate plays out differently in postcolonial contexts. Gyekye's moderate position—neither wholesale acceptance of Western modernity nor reactionary defense of all tradition—demonstrates that tradition and modernity can be evaluated critically and synthesized selectively. For political philosophy, this provides a model for how to navigate tradition-modernity tensions in a normatively sophisticated way that avoids both Eurocentrism and cultural relativism. The African experience reveals that tradition-modernity is not merely an analytical question but a practical political challenge.

  POSITION: Represents African philosophy's engagement with tradition-modernity debates, offering a moderate position between wholesale westernization and uncritical traditionalism.

@article{gross2002past,
  author = {Gross, David},
  title = {The Past in Ruins: Tradition and the Critique of Modernity},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {University of Massachusetts Press},
  address = {Amherst},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gross examines how tradition has been conceptualized, criticized, and appropriated in Western thought from the Enlightenment through postmodernity. He analyzes nine different strategies for relating to tradition in modernity: from outright rejection (Enlightenment rationalism) to romantic revival, from conservative defense to radical subversion. Gross shows how modernity's relationship to tradition has been dialectical rather than simply antagonistic—even modernist movements that claimed to break with tradition often created new traditions. He explores how thinkers have sought to "reappropriate tradition through its traces" and develop "subversive genealogies" that critique modernity from within traditional resources.

  RELEVANCE: This intellectual history provides essential context for understanding how "tradition" has been constructed as a concept in relation to modernity. It reveals that neither tradition nor modernity are stable categories but rather contested concepts that have been defined and redefined through their mutual opposition. For political philosophy, this genealogical approach shows that appeals to tradition are never simple returns to a pre-modern past but always involve selective interpretation and reappropriation. The book demonstrates that the critique of modernity has often drawn on traditional resources, complicating simple narratives of tradition's obsolescence.

  POSITION: Represents intellectual history and critical theory approach to tradition-modernity debates, influenced by Benjamin, Adorno, and genealogical methods.

  journal = {Journal of Mediterranean Studies},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {12},
  number = {1},
  pages = {23--42},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argyrou argues that the tradition-modernity binary itself is a product of European hegemony and functions to reproduce hierarchical relations between "modern" European societies and "traditional" Mediterranean ones. Drawing on Cypriot ethnography, he shows how the discourse of tradition vs. modernity positions non-Western or peripheral European societies as backward and in need of modernization. This discourse conceals power relations by presenting cultural differences as temporal stages. The very categories of tradition and modernity are thus ideological constructs that serve hegemonic purposes rather than neutral analytical tools.

  RELEVANCE: This postcolonial critique reveals that the tradition-modernity opposition itself may be a mechanism of power rather than a descriptive framework. For political philosophy, this suggests that uncritical use of the tradition-modernity binary may reproduce problematic hierarchies. The article demonstrates the importance of examining how concepts of tradition and modernity function politically and ideologically, not just analytically. It challenges the assumption that these categories are culturally neutral or universally applicable, showing how they emerged from specific European historical experiences and projects of domination.

  POSITION: Represents postcolonial and critical anthropological critique of tradition-modernity binary as ideological construct serving hegemonic purposes.

  year = {2015},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1163/9789004301078},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Duara examines how Asian religious and philosophical traditions (particularly from Sinosphere civilizations—China, Korea, Japan) can contribute to addressing the sustainability crisis of global modernity. He argues that the transcendent ideals embedded in Asian traditions—emphasizing harmony with nature, cyclical time, and interdependence—offer resources for reimagining modernity's relationship with the natural world. However, he also critically examines how these traditions were transformed by nationalist modernization projects in the 20th century. Duara advocates for a "dialogical transcendence" that critically retrieves traditional cosmological and ethical resources while engaging with modern concerns.

  RELEVANCE: This work demonstrates how traditional resources (Asian religious and philosophical traditions) can be critically appropriated to address distinctively modern problems (environmental crisis). It challenges the assumption that tradition is merely backward-looking or that modernity requires complete abandonment of traditional worldviews. For political philosophy, it suggests that normative resources for addressing contemporary challenges may be found in dialogue between traditional and modern thought, rather than privileging one over the other. The book shows how tradition-modernity is not merely a historical or sociological question but has profound implications for urgent global challenges.

  POSITION: Represents effort to retrieve traditional resources for contemporary problems, influenced by both multiple modernities framework and environmental humanities. Offers dialogical approach to tradition-modernity relations.

  volume = {36},
  pages = {69--89},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102629},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmermans and Epstein develop a sociological framework for understanding standards and standardization as tools for regulating and organizing social life in modernity. Against assumptions that standardization produces global convergence, they show through diverse empirical cases that standards have multiple, often unintended consequences. Standardization processes must be understood in their specific social, political, and economic contexts. The spread of standards does not produce a "standard world" but rather generates new forms of variation, resistance, and adaptation. Standards are sites of contestation where power relations are enacted and challenged.

  RELEVANCE: While not explicitly about tradition and modernity, this article illuminates how modernization processes work through standardization while producing heterogeneous outcomes rather than convergence. It helps explain how global modernity can coexist with persistent local traditions—standardization does not eliminate variation but reconfigures it. For understanding tradition in modern societies, this framework suggests that even universal modern institutions (standards, bureaucracies, markets) are always implemented through particular cultural contexts that shape their meaning and effects. The persistence of "non-standard" traditional practices within standardized modern institutions becomes intelligible.

  POSITION: Represents sociology of organizations and science/technology studies approaches to modernity, emphasizing heterogeneity within globalization processes.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780197547045.003.0004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Inglehart presents an evolutionary theory of modernization that explains value change as driven by changes in existential security. Throughout history, most people lived near starvation, but postwar prosperity and welfare states in advanced industrial societies launched an intergenerational shift from survival values to self-expression values. This is linked to secularization: as existential security increases, people have less need for the security provided by religion. However, Inglehart's theory is more nuanced than classical secularization theory—it predicts that societies with low existential security will remain religious even if economically developing, explaining persistent religiosity in the USA and much of the developing world.

  RELEVANCE: This revised modernization theory offers a more sophisticated account of tradition-modernity relations than classical versions. Rather than predicting universal convergence on secular modernity, it explains variation in religious persistence based on existential security. This helps explain why some modern societies secularize while others remain religious, and why within societies, more secure groups (educated, wealthy) tend to be less religious. For political philosophy, it suggests that tradition's (especially religion's) persistence or decline is not merely cultural but rooted in material conditions of security and development.

  POSITION: Represents neo-modernization theory incorporating insights from value change research and responding to critiques of classical modernization theory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Prickett examines how European intellectuals in the 18th-19th centuries invented and reinvented concepts of "tradition" in response to modernity. Rather than tradition being a stable inheritance from the past, he shows how figures like Herder, Schleiermacher, Coleridge, Newman, and Arnold actively constructed notions of Christian tradition, national tradition, and cultural tradition as responses to Enlightenment rationalism and social change. These "invented traditions" were attempts to provide continuity and meaning in conditions of rapid modernization. Prickett reveals the modern origins of what presented itself as ancient tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This intellectual history demonstrates that "tradition" itself is often a modern construction—a product of modernity's anxieties and needs rather than a pre-modern inheritance. This complicates political philosophical appeals to tradition by showing that what appears as ancient and unchanging is often recently invented. The book reveals the dialectical relationship between tradition and modernity: modernity generates need for tradition, and tradition is reinvented to serve modern purposes. For understanding the concept of tradition, this work shows that tradition is not simply what is handed down but what is actively constructed, often in reaction to social change.

  POSITION: Represents intellectual history and literature approach showing invention/construction of tradition in modernity, influenced by Hobsbawm and Ranger's "invented traditions" thesis.

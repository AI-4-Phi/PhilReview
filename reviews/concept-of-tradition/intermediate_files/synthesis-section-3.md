## Tradition, Rationality, and Authority

The relationship between tradition and rational critique constitutes the central tension in philosophical treatments of tradition. Since the Enlightenment, political philosophy has grappled with a fundamental question: Does rationality require transcending tradition, or is all rational inquiry necessarily tradition-constituted? This section traces how the Enlightenment framed tradition as prejudice opposed to autonomous reason, examines hermeneutic and virtue-ethical rehabilitations of tradition, considers critical theory's insistence that such rehabilitations remain inadequate for ideology-critique, and explores how the tradition-modernity binary itself has been contested by reflexive modernization theory, multiple modernities scholarship, and postcolonial perspectives.

### The Enlightenment Critique and Its Legacy

The Enlightenment positioned tradition as the primary obstacle to human emancipation. Kant's sapere aude demanded that individuals exercise their own reason rather than defer to inherited authority, framing tradition as tutelage from which rational agents must liberate themselves. As Dostal (2016) demonstrates, this Enlightenment stance generated what Gadamer would later identify as a "prejudice against prejudice"—the unexamined assumption that genuine understanding requires freedom from traditional commitments.

Yet the Enlightenment critique of tradition has its own genealogy that complicates any simple opposition between tradition and reason. Folkers (2016) traces how Foucault's genealogical investigations reveal that critique itself emerged from specific historical practices—particularly religious techniques of conscience examination that became secularized in Enlightenment demands for autonomous reason. Critique, on this account, is not a timeless standpoint outside tradition but rather an ethos with its own history, what Foucault characterizes as "permanent critique." The paradox is inescapable: the tradition of critiquing tradition is itself a tradition.

This paradox becomes particularly acute when viewed from non-Western perspectives. Allen (2016) argues that Frankfurt School critical theory, despite its critique of Enlightenment, remains complicit in Eurocentric progress narratives that privilege Western modernity as the telos of human emancipation. The very framing of tradition versus reason, she contends, universalizes a specifically European problematic. Tayob (2018) reinforces this point through analysis of Islamic intellectual history, showing how Muslim modernists from Muhammad Abduh to Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd developed critical relationships to tradition that do not conform to Kantian Enlightenment frameworks. These alternative critical traditions suggest that the opposition between tradition and rational critique may be parochial rather than universal—a product of particular European historical experiences rather than a necessary structure of rational inquiry.

### Hermeneutic and Virtue-Ethical Rehabilitation

Against the Enlightenment's dismissal, hermeneutic philosophy and virtue ethics rehabilitated tradition as enabling rather than obstructing rational understanding. Gadamer's (1989) philosophical hermeneutics argues that the Enlightenment harbored an unexamined prejudice—the assumption that understanding requires liberation from tradition. On the contrary, Gadamer contends, prejudice (Vorurteil) and belonging to tradition are conditions of possibility for understanding rather than obstacles to it. Effective-historical consciousness (wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstsein) reveals that we always understand from within traditions; this situatedness is not a limitation to overcome but the ground from which genuine understanding proceeds.

Warnke (1987) clarifies how Gadamer's position avoids both Enlightenment foundationalism and relativism. Effective-historical consciousness enables critical reflection on tradition, not mere passive acceptance. Understanding involves a "fusion of horizons" between interpreter and tradition, in which prejudgments are tested and revised through encounter with what is other. The hermeneutic circle—the movement between part and whole, between prejudgment and revision—provides resources for critique from within tradition rather than from an impossible standpoint outside it.

MacIntyre (1988) develops a parallel account of "tradition-constituted rationality" within an Aristotelian-Thomist framework. Against liberal Enlightenment claims to tradition-independent rationality, MacIntyre argues that all rational inquiry occurs within traditions that supply standards of justification, paradigmatic texts, and modes of argument. Different traditions—Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal—possess incommensurable conceptions of justice and rationality. Yet MacIntyre denies that this entails relativism. Traditions can be rationally compared: one tradition proves superior to another when it can explain why the rival tradition encountered problems it could not solve by its own lights, while the superior tradition resolves those problems.

D'Andrea (2017) and Lutz (2004) explicate how MacIntyre's account allows for rational progress within traditions through epistemological crises—moments when a tradition's resources prove inadequate and must be fundamentally revised. Such crises can be resolved through creative reformulation that preserves continuity while addressing novel challenges. Crucially, as Kuna (2005) emphasizes, traditions can learn from rivals and even acknowledge their own rational defeat. Tradition-constituted rationality thus accommodates both the embeddedness of reason in particular traditions and the possibility of tradition-transcending rational judgment.

Beam (1998) notes both convergences and divergences between Gadamer's hermeneutic approach and MacIntyre's virtue-ethical account. Both share a common critique of Enlightenment rationalism's pretension to tradition-independent reason; both rehabilitate tradition as resource rather than obstacle. Yet Gadamer emphasizes the linguisticality and ontological character of understanding, while MacIntyre focuses on moral traditions, practices, and the virtues required for sustaining rational inquiry.

### Critical Theory and Feminist Challenges

Despite the sophistication of hermeneutic and virtue-ethical rehabilitations, critical theory maintains that these approaches cannot adequately address tradition's ideological functions. Habermas (1990) crystallizes this objection: Gadamer's hermeneutics fails to account for systematically distorted communication and the ways tradition can embody relations of domination invisible from within. While Gadamer correctly identifies tradition's role in understanding, he provides no resources for ideology-critique—for recognizing when traditions perpetuate oppression under the guise of wisdom.

Forst (2023) articulates the Frankfurt School's central concern: critical theory aims to uncover forms of social domination ideologically presented as rationality—what Adorno termed "the unreason of the dominant reason." Traditions can function as such ideology, naturalizing contingent power arrangements and foreclosing emancipatory alternatives. The question is whether critique can function without resources external to tradition—whether Gadamer's encounter with otherness within tradition provides sufficient distance for recognizing systematic distortion.

Feminist theory intensifies this challenge while complicating simple oppositions. Benhabib (1992) develops "situated universalism" as an alternative to both liberal abstraction from social situatedness and communitarian imprisonment within tradition. Critical reflection, she argues, emerges from within traditions but can achieve universalist moral perspective through communicative rationality. Gender analysis reveals that both Enlightenment liberalism and communitarian defenses of tradition have excluded women's perspectives—the supposedly universal liberal subject is gendered masculine, while "tradition" has often meant patriarchal inheritance.

Allen (2008) synthesizes Frankfurt School critical theory with Foucauldian analytics of power to show how subjects are constituted through traditional norms and power relations. Autonomy, on this account, cannot mean standing outside tradition but rather involves critical engagement with the very traditions and power structures that shape us. The critical subject is always already tradition-formed; critique transforms tradition from within rather than transcending it entirely.

Yet postcolonial feminist perspectives challenge whether critique must always take the form of liberal rejection. Mahmood, as analyzed by Velji (2024), critiques "teleological feminism" that assumes agency only manifests as resistance to traditional norms. Through ethnography of Egyptian piety movements, Mahmood reveals how women cultivate agency through traditional Islamic practices rather than against them. Karoui (2020) similarly shows how feminist scholars like Fatima Mernissi recover progressive resources from classical Islamic tradition to challenge patriarchal interpretations from within. These interventions suggest that the critical feminist relationship to tradition need not replicate Enlightenment rejection; immanent transformation may be as emancipatory as oppositional overcoming.

### Tradition and Modernity Revisited

The binary opposition between tradition and modernity—which structures the debates traced above—has itself been contested by social theory since the 1990s. Reflexive modernization theory, multiple modernities scholarship, and postcolonial critique each challenge the assumption that modernity simply displaces tradition.

Beck, Giddens, and Lash (1994) argue that late modernity involves not tradition's elimination but its transformation. In "post-traditional" society, traditions lose their taken-for-granted character and must be explicitly chosen and justified. This "reflexive modernization" creates new modes of relating to tradition: rather than unreflective acceptance, modern subjects consciously appropriate, revise, or reject inherited practices. Tradition persists, but its authority must now be actively defended rather than assumed. Giddens (1991) emphasizes that this does not mean traditions disappear; rather, they are "disembedded" and "re-embedded" in new contexts, their continuation requiring reflexive justification.

Eisenstadt's (2000) multiple modernities framework challenges the assumption that modernization produces convergence on a Western model. Different civilizations—shaped by distinct religious traditions (Christian, Islamic, Confucian, Hindu, Buddhist)—develop distinctive patterns of modernity that incorporate rather than replace traditional elements. Western modernity is thus one pattern among many, not a universal template. This framework fundamentally challenges the tradition-modernity binary: "tradition" (understood as civilizational and cultural programs) does not disappear with modernization but shapes the specific form modernity takes in different contexts.

Bracke (2008) extends this analysis through ethnographic research on young Evangelical and Islamic women in the Netherlands who construct "pious modernity"—modern identities articulated from within religious frameworks rather than against them. These women incorporate and produce modernity while remaining committed to traditional religious practices, challenging the assumption that modern agency requires secularization. The concept of "pious modernity" suggests tradition and modernity can be conjugated in ways that neither classical modernization theory nor communitarian tradition-defense anticipated.

Postcolonial perspectives reveal that the tradition-modernity binary itself serves hegemonic functions. George (2024) examines how postcolonial scholars constructed tradition and modernity as antagonistic, viewing modernity as colonial imposition. Against this, Ambedkarite scholarship shows how B.R. Ambedkar synthesized traditional and modern elements, embracing modernity's emancipatory promise while critiquing oppressive traditional hierarchies like caste. For subordinated groups, aspects of modernity may be liberating from oppressive traditions rather than alienating from authentic culture. Gyekye (1997) develops a similar position from African philosophy, advocating critical evaluation of both traditional and modern elements based on their contribution to human flourishing—neither wholesale westernization nor uncritical traditionalism.

These perspectives converge on a crucial insight: the tradition-modernity opposition is itself a product of particular historical circumstances—specifically, European experiences of industrialization and secularization—rather than a universal analytical framework. Genuine engagement with non-Western contexts requires moving beyond this binary to recognize how traditions are continuously reinvented in modern conditions and how modernities take multiple forms shaped by civilizational inheritances.

---

The debate between tradition and rational critique remains unresolved, but its terms have been fundamentally transformed. Hermeneutic and virtue-ethical accounts convincingly demonstrate that understanding and inquiry are tradition-constituted; there is no view from nowhere from which tradition might be assessed by pure reason. Yet critical theorists rightly insist that traditions can perpetuate domination in ways that hermeneutic encounter with otherness may fail to reveal. The contemporary challenge is developing accounts of tradition that acknowledge both its enabling role—as condition of understanding and framework for inquiry—and its potential for ideological distortion, without collapsing into either naive traditionalism or abstract rationalism. Feminist and postcolonial perspectives complicate this task by revealing that both Enlightenment critique and hermeneutic rehabilitation may reproduce exclusions, while also demonstrating that transformative agency can emerge from within traditional practices rather than only through their rejection.

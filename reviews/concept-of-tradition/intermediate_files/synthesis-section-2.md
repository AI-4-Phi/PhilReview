## Contested Definitions and Ontologies of Tradition

The concept of tradition resists univocal definition. Across philosophical, sociological, and anthropological literatures, "tradition" names phenomena ranging from the broadest category of inherited culture to highly specific practices claiming authoritative continuity with a valued past. These definitional variations are not merely semantic; they carry distinct ontological commitments and political implications that shape how tradition figures in debates about authority, rationality, and social change.

### Definitional Spectrum and Conceptual Distinctions

At the broadest end of the definitional spectrum, Edward Shils (1981) treats tradition as encompassing "anything transmitted or handed down from the past to the present," including beliefs, practices, institutions, and material objects. This maximally inclusive definition captures tradition's role in social continuity but threatens to dissolve the concept into mere cultural inheritance, leaving unclear what distinguishes tradition from habit, custom, or convention. As Jacobs (2007) reconstructs, Shils synthesizes multiple perspectives on tradition's value: pragmatic (useful accumulated knowledge), Burkean (embodied collective wisdom), veridical (transmission of truth), and evolutionist (products of social selection). Yet this very richness generates tensions about which properties are essential.

Martin Beckstein (2016) offers a more exacting analysis, arguing that traditions are distinguished by three features: claimed continuity with the past, explicit transmission between generations, and capacity for authentic development. Unlike mere customs, traditions involve reflexive awareness of their historical lineage and normative authority derived from that lineage. Beckstein's central insight concerns how traditions can change while remaining the same: authentic continuation requires that modifications be "comprehensible as developments of the tradition's core commitments rather than breaks from them" (Beckstein 2016, 502). This resolves the apparent paradox that living traditions must evolve to survive, yet evolution threatens their identity.

The distinction between tradition and custom proves analytically crucial. Kenneth Olwig (2001) captures this through a memorable formulation: custom is "time out of mind" while tradition is "mind out of time." Customs are tacit, embedded practices whose origins recede into unreflective antiquity; traditions are explicitly thematized inheritances, consciously transmitted as authoritative. This distinction carries normative weight: customs may embody practical wisdom accumulated through trial and error, while traditions involve claims about what the past demands of the present. Political philosophy has not sufficiently attended to this difference, often treating "tradition" and "custom" as synonymous when they name distinct social phenomena with different relationships to rational critique.

The relationship between tradition and convention further clarifies tradition's distinctive features. David Lewis's (1969) canonical analysis defines conventions as arbitrary solutions to coordination problems, sustained by mutual expectations rather than inherent authority. Conventions are self-enforcing equilibria: I drive on the right because I expect you to, and you expect me to. Andrei Marmor (2009) extends this by distinguishing "deep conventions" (constitutive rules creating new possibilities) from "surface conventions" (mere coordination devices). Traditions differ from both: they are not arbitrary but claim non-arbitrary authority derived from their historical sources. A tradition's legitimacy purportedly derives from what it transmits, not merely from the fact that participants converge on it. Where conventions can be replaced by equally good alternatives, traditions claim irreplaceable value tied to their specific historical lineage.

### Social Ontological Status of Traditions

If traditions are real social phenomena, what kind of entities are they? Contemporary social ontology offers competing frameworks, though few directly address tradition. John Searle's (1995) influential account of institutional facts provides one approach: social entities exist through collective acceptance of status functions via the formula "X counts as Y in context C." Traditions might be understood as practices that count as authoritative inheritances within a community. Yet as Joshua Rust (2021) argues, Searle's rule-based framework is better suited to modern legal-rational authority than to traditional authority, which operates through exemplars and precedents rather than constitutive rules. Traditional legitimacy derives not from collective acceptance of a rule but from recognized continuity with authoritative paradigm cases.

Margaret Gilbert's (1996) plural subject theory offers an alternative grounding. On this view, collective phenomena are constituted by joint commitments that create obligations participants cannot unilaterally revoke. Traditions would be plural subjects whose members are jointly committed to maintaining and transmitting certain practices. This helps explain tradition's normative force: participants feel bound to continue practices because joint commitment creates genuine obligations, not merely expectations. Gilbert's framework illuminates how traditions persist despite membership turnover, since the plural subject transcends its current participants.

Theodore Schatzki's (2002) practice-based social ontology provides yet another approach. For Schatzki, social phenomena are organized arrays of human activity constituted by practical understandings, rules, and "teleoaffective structures" (ends, projects, emotions). Traditions on this view are not primarily mental states or collective beliefs but organized practices embodied in concrete activities and material arrangements. This captures how traditions are transmitted through participation rather than explicit instruction, and why they involve not just beliefs but skills, dispositions, and emotional orientations.

Recent work attempts integration. Brouwer, Ferrario, and Porello (2020) develop a "hybrid" account of collective intentionality that incorporates both individual commitments and irreducibly collective properties. Applied to tradition, this suggests that traditional practices involve both personal reasons for participation and genuinely collective features that transcend individual attitudes. Traditions may require what Raimo Tuomela (2002) calls "we-mode" engagement: participants acting as members of a tradition-bearing group rather than as isolated individuals pursuing private purposes.

What unites these approaches is recognition that traditions possess emergent social properties not reducible to individual mental states. But what remains undertheorized is the temporal dimension: how traditions maintain identity across generational turnover, how transmission mechanisms sustain collective properties over time, and whether the same social ontological frameworks adequate for synchronic collective phenomena can capture tradition's essentially diachronic character.

### Construction, Invention, and Authenticity

The "invention of tradition" thesis challenges essentialist accounts that treat traditions as organic inheritances gradually evolved from time immemorial. Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger's (1983) influential collection demonstrates that many apparently ancient traditions are modern political constructions: the Scottish Highland tradition, British royal ceremony, and colonial administrative practices all involved deliberate invention claiming false antiquity. Hobsbawm defines "invented tradition" as practices "seeking to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past" (Hobsbawm 2012, 1). The political function is clear: invented traditions legitimate institutions, establish social cohesion, and socialize individuals into desired behaviors by borrowing the authority of a fabricated past.

Richard Handler and Jocelyn Linnekin (1984) radicalize this critique, arguing that the genuine/spurious distinction cannot be maintained because all tradition involves symbolic construction in the present. What appears as continuity always involves selective interpretation and creative reinterpretation. "Authenticity" is not an objective property but a category used within traditions to validate certain practices over others. If this is correct, even traditions with genuine historical depth are continuously reconstructed rather than passively inherited.

This constructivist consensus has been extended to intellectual traditions themselves. Richard Bourke (2018) and Emily Jones (2017) have demonstrated that "Burkean conservatism" as a political tradition was largely a nineteenth-century invention, retrospectively constructing Edmund Burke as founder of a coherent conservative doctrine he never articulated. Stephen Prickett (2002) traces similar dynamics in how religious and literary traditions have been invented and reinvented to serve present purposes while claiming ancient pedigree.

Yet radical constructivism generates its own difficulties. If all traditions are equally constructed, what grounds remain for tradition's normative authority? One response, developed by Ton Otto and Poul Pedersen (2005), seeks synthesis: traditions involve both genuine transmission and inventive appropriation, with agents drawing on inherited resources to address new circumstances. Neither pure continuity nor pure invention captures how tradition actually operates. Beckstein (2016) provides philosophical resources here: the question is not whether traditions change but whether changes count as authentic continuation or rupture. Criteria for authentic development can acknowledge construction while preserving space for normative assessment.

The constructivist challenge reveals that tradition's authority cannot rest solely on claimed antiquity, since such claims may be fabricated. But it does not follow that construction delegitimates tradition entirely. Traditions might be evaluated by their consequences, internal coherence, or capacity for self-criticism rather than their origins. This unresolved tension between sociological constructivism and normative political philosophy shapes subsequent debates about whether and when traditions deserve authority.

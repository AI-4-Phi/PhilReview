====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses foundational philosophical analyses of tradition as a
concept. The literature reveals several key debates: (1) the necessary and
sufficient conditions for distinguishing tradition from related concepts like
custom, convention, habit, and practice; (2) the role of temporality, continuity,
and transmission in constituting traditions; and (3) the relationship between
tradition and rationality, authority, and innovation. Three major positions emerge:
conservative approaches that emphasize tradition's authority and continuity (Burke,
Oakeshott, Shils); hermeneutic approaches that view tradition as the condition
of understanding (Gadamer, Ricoeur); and critical approaches that examine tradition's
role in power and legitimation (Arendt, MacIntyre). Recent work (Beckstein 2016,
Jacobs 2007) attempts systematic conceptual analysis, addressing tensions between
tradition's static (continuity) and dynamic (living) aspects.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These foundational analyses are essential for establishing clear conceptual
boundaries for the research project. They provide the philosophical vocabulary
and distinctions needed to compare how different disciplinary literatures
(political philosophy, sociology, political science) define and operationalize
the concept of tradition. The debate over "living traditions" (Beckstein 2016)
directly addresses how traditions can change while remaining the same, a core
puzzle for understanding tradition's role in political philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is rich literature on tradition in hermeneutic and conservative
political philosophy, there is surprisingly little systematic conceptual analysis
in analytic philosophy. The relationship between tradition and social ontology
(collective intentionality, group agency) remains under-theorized. Few works
explicitly compare tradition to related concepts like convention or practice in
detail.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize synthesis around three axes: (1) definitional criteria (what makes
something a tradition?); (2) ontological status (what kind of thing is a tradition?);
(3) normative significance (what authority do traditions possess?). Use Beckstein
(2016) and Shils (1981) as anchors for systematic conceptual analysis, then map
other positions onto this framework.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Conservative accounts (8 papers): Tradition as authoritative inheritance
- Hermeneutic accounts (6 papers): Tradition as condition of understanding
- Critical accounts (4 papers): Tradition as contested and constructed

  author = {Beckstein, Martin},
  title = {The concept of a living tradition},
  journal = {European Journal of Social Theory},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {20},

  doi = {10.1177/1368431016668185},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beckstein provides the most systematic contemporary analysis of tradition,
  arguing that traditions are socially valuable precisely because they are "living"—capable
  of authentic continuation through evolution. He distinguishes traditions from mere customs
  by their claim to continuity with the past and their requirement of explicit transmission.
  The central paradox: traditions must change to remain authentic, yet change threatens
  their identity as the "same" tradition. Beckstein resolves this through criteria for
  authentic continuation: changes must be comprehensible as developments of the tradition's
  core commitments rather than breaks from them.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is foundational for the research project because it offers the most
  detailed contemporary conceptual analysis of tradition. Beckstein's distinction between
  tradition and custom/convention clarifies what conceptual work "tradition" does that other
  concepts cannot. His analysis of "living traditions" directly addresses how traditions can
  be both conservative (maintaining continuity) and dynamic (evolving), a tension central to
  understanding tradition's role in political philosophy. The paper also bridges analytic and
  continental approaches to tradition.

  POSITION: Analytic conceptual analysis with hermeneutic influences. Beckstein argues for
  tradition as a distinct social form characterized by claimed continuity, explicit transmission,
  and capacity for authentic development.

  volume = {37},
  number = {2},
  pages = {139--162},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393107300085},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs reconstructs Edward Shils' pioneering theory of tradition from his 1981
  book Tradition. Shils provided the first systematic conceptual treatment of tradition in
  sociology, arguing that tradition encompasses anything handed down or transmitted from the past,
  from beliefs to practices to material objects. Jacobs identifies four perspectives in Shils'
  multifaceted account: pragmatic (tradition as useful inheritance), Burkean (tradition as
  embodied wisdom), veridical (tradition as carrier of truth), and evolutionist (tradition as
  product of selection). Shils emphasized tradition's institutional bearers and typology of
  traditions (personal, societal, cultural, etc.).

  RELEVANCE: Shils' work represents the foundational sociological treatment of tradition and
  directly influences later conceptual analyses (including Beckstein). For a project surveying
  how tradition is defined across disciplines, Shils is essential as the reference point for
  sociological approaches. Jacobs' reconstruction helps clarify Shils' sometimes ambiguous
  definitions and typology. The tension between Shils' broad definition (anything transmitted)
  and narrower definitions (only certain kinds of transmissions) mirrors debates across the
  literature.

  POSITION: Sociological functionalism with conservative sympathies. Shils views tradition as
  central to social order and continuity, emphasizing its positive functions while acknowledging
  its plurality and institutional embedding.

@incollection{alexander2013three,
  author = {Alexander, James},
  title = {Three Rival Views of Tradition (Arendt, Oakeshott and MacIntyre)},
  booktitle = {Oakeshott on History},
  editor = {Coats, Wendell John},
  year = {2013},
  publisher = {Imprint Academic},
  address = {Exeter},
  pages = {187--210},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander compares three major twentieth-century philosophical treatments
  of tradition by Hannah Arendt, Michael Oakeshott, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Each theorist sees
  tradition as central to understanding human existence but diagnoses modernity's problem with
  tradition differently. Arendt views tradition as a broken thread connecting past to present,
  Oakeshott sees tradition as the medium of political activity itself (not an object but a
  mode of engagement), and MacIntyre argues for tradition-constituted rationality where rational
  inquiry always proceeds within and between traditions. These three views represent distinct
  ways of conceiving tradition's relationship to reason and modernity.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis is valuable for the research project because it maps key
  theoretical positions in political philosophy's treatment of tradition. It shows how different
  understandings of tradition track different accounts of modernity, rationality, and political
  life. For a project examining how tradition is conceptualized, Alexander's framework helps
  identify the stakes: is tradition a thing (Arendt), a mode (Oakeshott), or a framework
  (MacIntyre)? These are fundamentally different ontologies with different implications.

  POSITION: Comparative analysis identifying three rival ontologies of tradition: tradition
  as object (Arendt), tradition as practice (Oakeshott), tradition as framework for rationality
  (MacIntyre).

@article{leiviska2015relevance,
  author = {Leiviskä, Anniina},
  title = {The Relevance of Hans-Georg Gadamer's Concept of Tradition to the Philosophy of Education},
  journal = {Educational Theory},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {65},
  number = {5},
  pages = {581--600},
  doi = {10.1111/EDTH.12135},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Leiviskä argues that Gadamer's hermeneutic concept of tradition is fundamentally
  non-conservative despite its reputation. For Gadamer, tradition is not a body of inherited
  content but the condition of possibility for understanding itself—we always understand from
  within traditions, but this situatedness enables rather than constrains critical reflection.
  Tradition allows reflective reappropriation through encounter with other horizons (including
  the horizons of the past). Leiviskä shows how this connects to Aristotelian phronesis: a
  situated, practical rationality that depends on belonging to traditions while remaining
  critically open.

  RELEVANCE: Gadamer's hermeneutic concept of tradition is one of the most influential in
  twentieth-century philosophy, fundamentally reshaping how tradition is understood in relation
  to reason. For the research project, Gadamer represents the hermeneutic position that tradition
  is not opposed to critical thinking but is its precondition. This contrasts sharply with
  Enlightenment views of tradition as authority to be overcome. Leiviskä's clarification that
  Gadamer's view is non-conservative helps distinguish hermeneutic from conservative approaches.

  POSITION: Hermeneutic phenomenology. Tradition as condition of understanding and horizon of
  interpretation, compatible with critical reflection through encounter with otherness.

@book{lewis1969convention,
  author = {Lewis, David},
  title = {Convention: A Philosophical Study},
  year = {1969},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewis provides the canonical analytic philosophical account of convention,
  defining conventions as solutions to coordination problems that arise from common knowledge
  of mutual expectations. Conventions are arbitrary regularities in behavior that persist
  because everyone expects everyone else to conform and prefers to conform given that expectation.
  Lewis grounds conventions in game-theoretic equilibria and distinguishes them from social
  norms, traditions, and natural laws. Conventions are self-sustaining through mutual expectation
  rather than enforcement or inherent authority.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on convention rather than tradition, Lewis' analysis is crucial
  for conceptually distinguishing these terms. The SEP entry on Convention notes that "convention"
  and "traditional" are often used interchangeably, but Lewis shows they are distinct: conventions
  are arbitrary solutions to coordination problems, while traditions claim non-arbitrary authority
  from the past. This distinction helps clarify what makes tradition a distinct concept. Lewis'
  framework also raises the question: can traditions be understood as conventions? Or do they
  require different conceptual resources?

  POSITION: Analytic philosophy of language and action. Convention as coordination equilibrium
  based on common knowledge and mutual expectations, distinguished from tradition by arbitrariness
  and lack of historical authority claims.

@article{marmor2009social,
  author = {Marmor, Andrei},
  title = {Social Conventions: From Language to Law},
  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Marmor extends Lewis' account of convention while addressing its limitations.
  He argues that conventions are not merely coordination equilibria but are constitutive rules
  that create new forms of activity and social reality. Marmor distinguishes "deep conventions"
  (constitutive rules like chess rules) from "surface conventions" (coordination devices).
  He explores how conventions differ from customs, which are non-arbitrary regularities justified
  by past practice, and from norms, which have moral or rational force independent of conventional
  practice.

  RELEVANCE: Marmor's work is essential for distinguishing convention from related concepts,
  particularly custom and tradition. His account of deep conventions as constitutive (creating
  new possibilities) versus surface conventions as coordinative helps map the conceptual space.
  For the research project, this raises the question: are traditions more like customs (justified
  by past practice) or like deep conventions (constitutive of forms of life)? Marmor's distinction
  between arbitrary conventions and non-arbitrary customs parallels discussions of tradition's
  claimed authority.

  POSITION: Legal and social philosophy extending Lewis. Conventions as constitutive rules
  and coordination devices, distinguished from customs by arbitrariness and from norms by
  dependence on practice.

@book{gilbert1989social,
  author = {Gilbert, Margaret},
  title = {On Social Facts},
  year = {1989},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gilbert develops her influential "plural subject" account of social phenomena,
  arguing that collective phenomena (including conventions, social norms, and group beliefs)
  are constituted by joint commitments. When people form a plural subject, they commit together
  to uphold certain beliefs, intentions, or practices as a body. This joint commitment creates
  obligations and normative expectations that cannot be reduced to individual commitments.
  Gilbert critiques Lewisian accounts of convention as unable to capture the normative force
  and obligation characteristic of many social practices.

  RELEVANCE: Gilbert's plural subject theory is foundational for social ontology and raises
  important questions for understanding tradition. If traditions are social phenomena, do they
  require joint commitments among participants? Or can traditions exist through aggregated
  individual participation without collective commitment? Gilbert's emphasis on normativity
  and obligation in social practices suggests traditions may have a social ontology similar to
  conventions or social norms. For a project on the concept of tradition, Gilbert provides
  conceptual resources for understanding tradition's social reality.

  POSITION: Social ontology and philosophy of social science. Plural subject theory emphasizing
  joint commitment as constitutive of social phenomena including conventions and collective
  practices.

@book{searle1995construction,
  author = {Searle, John R.},
  title = {The Construction of Social Reality},
  year = {1995},
  publisher = {Free Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle provides a systematic account of social ontology, arguing that
  institutional facts (money, property, marriage) are created through collective intentionality
  and constitutive rules of the form "X counts as Y in context C." Social reality is constructed
  through collective recognition and acceptance of status functions. Unlike Gilbert, Searle
  emphasizes collective intentionality (we-intentions) rather than joint commitments, and he
  grounds institutional reality in human intentionality without requiring explicit agreements.
  Status functions persist through collective acceptance even when individual participants change.

  RELEVANCE: Searle's framework is widely used in social ontology and raises questions about
  tradition's ontological status. Are traditions institutional facts constituted by collective
  acceptance? If so, what is the "X counts as Y" structure? Perhaps: "This practice (X) counts
  as authoritative tradition (Y) in our community (C)"? Searle's emphasis on collective acceptance
  and status functions helps explain how traditions can persist across generations despite
  changing participants. His framework is essential for situating tradition within contemporary
  social ontology debates.

  POSITION: Social ontology emphasizing collective intentionality and constitutive rules.
  Institutional facts created through collective assignment of status functions, persisting
  through collective acceptance.

@book{tuomela2002philosophy,
  author = {Tuomela, Raimo},
  title = {The Philosophy of Social Practices: A Collective Acceptance View},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Tuomela develops a comprehensive account of social practices as sustained by
  collective acceptance. He distinguishes between I-mode (individual mode) and we-mode (collective
  mode) attitudes and actions. In we-mode, individuals act as group members, committing to group
  reasons and goals. Social practices, including traditions, are sustained through collective
  acceptance of constitutive and regulative rules. Tuomela emphasizes that social practices
  require participants to act as group members rather than merely as individuals pursuing private
  goals.

  RELEVANCE: Tuomela's we-mode framework provides conceptual resources for understanding how
  traditions are collectively sustained. If traditions are social practices requiring collective
  acceptance, then participants must adopt we-mode attitudes: acting as members of the tradition-
  bearing community rather than as isolated individuals. This helps explain tradition's normative
  force and its persistence across individual lifecycles. Tuomela's framework connects tradition
  to social ontology debates about collective intentionality and raises questions about what
  kind of collective acceptance is required for tradition.

  POSITION: Social ontology emphasizing collective acceptance and we-mode sociality. Social
  practices sustained through participants acting as group members and collectively accepting
  constitutive norms.

  year = {2012},
  publisher = {Springer},
  address = {Dordrecht},
  pages = {271--288},
  doi = {10.1007/978-94-007-5600-7_13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Salice examines social ontology from the phenomenological realist tradition
  (Reinach, Scheler, Stein), showing how this tradition offers distinctive resources for
  understanding social entities. Phenomenological realists emphasize the sui generis character
  of social acts and entities, irreducible to individual mental states or aggregations. Social
  acts like promising create objective obligations and social relations with their own ontological
  status. This tradition emphasizes the normative and obligatory character of social phenomena.

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about tradition, Salice's reconstruction of phenomenological
  social ontology provides alternative conceptual resources to the dominant Anglo-American
  frameworks (Gilbert, Searle, Tuomela). If traditions are understood as social entities with
  normative force, the phenomenological tradition offers tools for analyzing their sui generis
  character. This is particularly relevant because hermeneutic accounts of tradition (Gadamer)
  are rooted in phenomenology, suggesting connections between phenomenological social ontology
  and hermeneutic accounts of tradition.

  POSITION: Phenomenological realism in social ontology. Social acts and entities as sui generis
  with irreducible normative and obligatory character, drawing on Reinach, Scheler, and Stein.

@article{olwig2001time,

  journal = {International Journal of Heritage Studies},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {7},
  number = {4},
  pages = {339--354},
  doi = {10.1080/13581650120105543},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Olwig distinguishes "custom" from "tradition" in environmental heritage contexts.
  Custom is embedded practice, tacit and evolving organically through everyday life ("time out
  of mind"). Tradition is explicitly thematized inheritance, consciously transmitted and claimed
  as authoritative ("mind out of time"). This distinction challenges romantic notions that conflate
  the two, showing that what we call "tradition" often involves modern invention and conscious
  construction rather than organic continuity. Olwig applies this to heritage conservation,
  arguing that treating living customs as traditions can freeze and distort them.

  RELEVANCE: Olwig's distinction between custom and tradition is conceptually important for
  the research project. It challenges the common conflation of these terms and suggests they
  name different social phenomena: custom as unreflective practice embedded in everyday life,
  tradition as reflexive claim about authoritative inheritance. This resonates with Beckstein's
  distinction between tradition and custom based on explicit transmission and claimed continuity.
  For political philosophy, this distinction matters: customs may be sites of practical wisdom
  (Oakeshott), while traditions may be sites of authority claims and contestation (Arendt).

  POSITION: Heritage studies and cultural geography. Sharp distinction between organic custom
  (tacit, evolving) and invented tradition (explicit, constructed), applied to environmental
  and cultural heritage.

@article{grad2016tradition,

  title = {Tradition as a Communication System: A Pragmatic Approach},
  journal = {Dialogue and Universalism},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {26},
  number = {1},
  pages = {129--141},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grad analyzes tradition as a communication system with a rational structure.
  Drawing on pragmatics and language game theory (Wittgenstein), he argues that traditions
  function as rule-governed communication systems within closed communities. Traditions establish
  defined principles of communication for members and rules of inclusion for potential new
  members. The rational structure of tradition lies in its systematic organization of meaning
  and practice, not in the content of what is transmitted. This shifts focus from tradition's
  content to its structural properties as a communication system.

  RELEVANCE: Grad's pragmatic approach offers a distinctive angle on tradition, focusing on
  its communicative and rule-governed character. This connects tradition to debates about
  linguistic convention (Lewis) while emphasizing tradition's closure and membership boundaries
  (unlike open linguistic conventions). For the research project, this raises questions about
  tradition's relationship to Wittgensteinian forms of life and language games. It also suggests
  tensions: if traditions are closed communication systems, how do they evolve? How do outsiders
  gain access?

  POSITION: Pragmatic philosophy of language. Tradition as rational communication system with
  language-game structure, emphasizing rules and closure rather than content or transmission.

  number = {2},
  pages = {12--18},
  doi = {10.30525/2592-8813-2021-2-3},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Balabushka traces the evolution of the concept of tradition across multiple
  disciplinary perspectives (philosophy, ethnology, religion, art history, ethnography). The
  paper analyzes different types and classifications of tradition, showing how the concept has
  been theorized differently in national versus foreign historiography. Tradition is presented
  as the result of material and spiritual socio-cultural heritage that determines national
  identity and statehood, constituted by collective human activity. The paper uses historical-
  retrospective and systematic methods to map the concept's development.

  RELEVANCE: This synthetic overview helps situate tradition within broader cultural studies
  and heritage discourses. While less philosophically rigorous than other entries, it demonstrates
  how tradition functions as a concept across multiple disciplines beyond philosophy. For a
  project surveying how tradition is defined across fields, Balabushka's multidisciplinary
  perspective shows the concept's complexity and disciplinary variation. It also highlights
  tradition's connection to identity and collective memory, themes important in political
  philosophy.

  POSITION: Cultural studies and historiography. Tradition as syncretic concept spanning

  number = {6},
  pages = {531--554},
  doi = {10.1177/00483931211016046},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Turner traces the intellectual history of "post-traditional" discourse in
  sociology, showing how the concept of post-tradition itself became a tradition. Starting
  with Weber's disenchantment thesis and moving through critical theory and reflexive modernization
  theory (Giddens, Beck), Turner reveals the paradox: critiques of tradition create their own
  authoritative lineages. Post-traditional theorists inherit and transmit particular ways of
  diagnosing modernity's relationship to tradition. Turner exposes the concept's variations
  and motivations, questioning whether post-traditional society is possible or merely an
  ideological self-description of modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Turner's genealogy of post-traditional discourse is crucial for understanding
  contemporary debates about tradition. It shows how "tradition" functions as a contested
  category in social theory, with different theorists using it to mark the boundary between
  modern and pre-modern society. For political philosophy, this raises questions about whether
  tradition is necessarily pre-modern or whether it persists (perhaps transformed) in modernity.
  Turner's work also demonstrates reflexive irony: the "tradition of post-tradition" suggests
  we cannot fully escape tradition even in diagnosing its end.

  POSITION: Historical sociology and intellectual history. Genealogical critique of post-
  traditional discourse, revealing its own traditional structure and questioning the possibility
  of genuinely post-traditional society.

  pages = {608--620},
  doi = {10.21638/spbu17.2021.401},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sokolov and Kuznetsov analyze the correlation between philosophical methodology
  in modernity and the problematization of tradition in the humanities. They argue that tradition
  became a starting point for developing humanitarian knowledge and contributed to philosophical
  research's methodological expansion. Tracing from Romantic fascination with antiquity through
  19th century attempts to rationally reconstruct religious and historical texts, they show how
  tradition's problematization shaped disciplinary development (history, psychology, linguistics).
  The paper connects phenomenology, hermeneutics (Dilthey, Husserl), and structuralism through
  their shared engagement with tradition. They provocatively suggest that even anti-rationalist
  traditionalism (Guenon) reproduces modern methodological patterns.

  RELEVANCE: This paper illuminates how "tradition" became a methodological problem for modern
  philosophy and human sciences. It shows that tradition is not simply an object of study but
  a concept that shaped disciplinary self-understanding and method. For a project on how
  tradition is conceptualized, this highlights that disciplinary commitments and methodological
  orientations structure how tradition is defined. The connection between hermeneutic philosophy
  and tradition scholarship is particularly important for understanding Gadamer's influence.

  problem constitutive of modern humanities, connecting phenomenology, hermeneutics, and

  doi = {10.21638/spbu17.2024.212},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzing tradition through René Guénon's traditionalism, Karimov and Bekbaev
  argue that tradition enables intercultural and interreligious dialogue. For Guénon, tradition
  has exoteric (social order) and esoteric (spiritual truth) dimensions. The esoteric essence,
  comprehended through intellectual intuition beyond rational thought, reveals coincidences
  between religious traditions across cultures. Western modernity's anti-traditionalism
  (materialism, egalitarianism, individualism) represents a civilizational crisis, resolvable
  only through reviving tradition via Eastern religious experience. The authors examine how
  tradition functions as a connecting factor between cultures through shared spiritual realities.

  RELEVANCE: While representing a particular metaphysical position (perennialist traditionalism),
  this paper illustrates one influential understanding of tradition as trans-cultural spiritual
  reality accessible through non-rational intuition. This contrasts sharply with social-scientific
  and hermeneutic approaches that view traditions as particular, culturally-embedded formations.
  For a comprehensive survey of how tradition is conceptualized, including traditionalist
  metaphysics helps map the full conceptual space, even if this position is marginal in
  contemporary political philosophy.

  title = {Tradition: Concept and Claim},
  year = {2010},
  publisher = {St. Augustine's Press},
  address = {South Bend, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pieper provides a philosophical-theological analysis of tradition, arguing
  that authentic tradition ultimately refers to sacred tradition going back to divine revelation.
  He distinguishes genuine tradition from mere convention or custom by tradition's claim to
  transmit truth from a primordial source. Tradition is not simply what is handed down, but what
  is authoritatively handed down as true and binding. Pieper emphasizes tradition's claim to
  truth and its grounding in a founding event or revelation that establishes its authority.
  This connects tradition to questions of truth, authority, and the relationship between human
  culture and transcendent reality.

  RELEVANCE: Pieper represents the theological-metaphysical approach to tradition, important
  for understanding how tradition is conceptualized in religious contexts and in thinkers
  influenced by religious thought. His emphasis on tradition's claim to truth (not merely its
  facticity as transmitted) raises philosophical questions about tradition's epistemological
  status. For political philosophy, Pieper's account highlights tensions between secular and
  religious understandings of tradition. His work is cited in contemporary philosophical
  discussions (see PhilPapers results), showing ongoing influence.

  POSITION: Thomistic philosophical theology. Tradition as authoritative transmission of truth
  from primordial revelation, distinguished from custom by its truth-claim and sacred origin.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Fernand Dumont's concept of "mediating institutions" and Himani
  Bannerji's critique of multiculturalism, Melançon examines how philosophy can mediate between
  diverse traditions in contexts of cultural plurality. Dumont saw philosophy as referring to
  a tradition of radical self-questioning, a second-order tradition that reflects on first-order
  traditions. However, Dumont's framework addressed Quebec's social changes without adequately
  accounting for multiple coexisting traditions. Melançon brings Dumont into dialogue with
  Bannerji's critique of hegemonic tradition-protection, seeking non-hegemonic mediation between
  sets of traditions. The paper addresses how traditions can coexist and interact without
  domination.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses a crucial problem for contemporary political philosophy: how
  to think about tradition in pluralistic, multicultural societies. It goes beyond single-
  tradition frameworks (MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality) to ask about relationships
  between traditions. The concept of mediating institutions and philosophy's role as second-order
  tradition is philosophically rich. For the research project, this illustrates how tradition
  is being reconceptualized to address contemporary political challenges of diversity, moving
  beyond older conservative or hermeneutic models.

  POSITION: Critical social theory drawing on Dumont and Bannerji. Philosophy as mediating
  institution between traditions, addressing tradition in pluralistic contexts and critiquing
  hegemonic tradition-protection.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ambord examines Gadamer's hermeneutic account of tradition and its political
  implications. He shows how Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition responds to Enlightenment
  critiques while avoiding conservative traditionalism. For Gadamer, tradition is not a body
  of static content but the historical dimension of understanding itself—we understand by
  applying past meanings to present situations. This makes tradition enabling rather than
  constraining. Ambord explores how this hermeneutic conception influences political thought,
  particularly debates about tradition's role in legitimating or challenging political orders.

  RELEVANCE: This paper helps clarify Gadamer's influence on contemporary political philosophy's
  treatment of tradition. It shows how hermeneutic philosophy transformed tradition from an
  object of conservative reverence or Enlightenment critique into a condition of understanding.
  For the research project, this is essential for mapping the hermeneutic position alongside
  conservative and critical approaches. Ambord's focus on political implications also directly
  addresses how philosophical concepts of tradition connect to political theory.

  POSITION: Hermeneutic philosophy (Gadamer). Tradition as enabling condition of understanding
  and application, neither conservative valorization nor Enlightenment rejection, with political
  implications for legitimacy and critique.

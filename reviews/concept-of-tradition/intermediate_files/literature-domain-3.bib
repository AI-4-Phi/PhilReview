====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses liberal, progressive, and critical theoretical perspectives
that question, critique, or seek to transform tradition. It includes Enlightenment
rationalism's critique of tradition as obstacle to reason and progress; the Frankfurt
School's analysis of tradition and authority (Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas); feminist
critiques of tradition as patriarchal inheritance; and liberal arguments for
subordinating tradition to rational justification and individual autonomy.

The key positions span from Enlightenment thinkers who viewed tradition as
"prejudice" requiring critical scrutiny, to Frankfurt School theorists who analyzed
how tradition serves ideological functions under capitalism, to feminist scholars
who critique tradition as vehicle of patriarchal oppression while sometimes
rehabilitating counter-traditions. Recent work explores how these critical perspectives
intersect with postcolonial theory, care ethics, and debates over liberal autonomy.

Major debates include: the relationship between critique and tradition (can critique
function without traditional resources?); whether liberal autonomy requires rejection
of tradition or can accommodate it; how feminist critique navigates between rejecting
patriarchal traditions and affirming women's counter-traditions; and whether critical
theory's Enlightenment inheritance limits its emancipatory potential.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for understanding how tradition has been theorized as an
obstacle to human emancipation and rational progress. It provides the critical
counterpoint to conservative and communitarian defenses of tradition, showing how
tradition can function as ideology, domination, and patriarchal control. These
perspectives are crucial for mapping the full conceptual landscape of tradition
in contemporary political philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Frankfurt School perspectives are well-represented, there is limited coverage
of second and third-generation critical theorists beyond Habermas. Additionally,
intersectional feminist critiques that combine race, class, and gender analyses
of tradition could be stronger. The relationship between liberal critique and
non-Western traditions also merits further investigation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain, emphasize how critical perspectives reveal the
power dimensions embedded in tradition. Highlight the tension between critique
as an Enlightenment inheritance and critique of the Enlightenment tradition itself.
Consider how feminist scholars navigate this tension by both critiquing patriarchal
traditions and affirming alternative genealogies. The Frankfurt School's immanent
critique methodology offers important resources for thinking about tradition
critically while acknowledging critique's own situatedness.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Enlightenment Rationalism: 4 papers - Tradition as prejudice requiring critical examination
- Frankfurt School Critical Theory: 5 papers - Tradition as ideological formation under capitalism
- Feminist Critique: 6 papers - Tradition as patriarchal while recovering counter-traditions
- Liberal Autonomy: 3 papers - Tradition subordinated to individual rational choice

@article{folkers2016daring,
  author = {Folkers, Andreas},
  title = {Daring the Truth: Foucault, Parrhesia and the Genealogy of Critique},
  journal = {Theory, Culture \& Society},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {33},
  pages = {3--28},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276414558885},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Foucault's genealogy traces critique from ancient parrhesia (truth-telling) through Enlightenment to liberal critique of the state, revealing critique as an ethos of "permanent critique" rather than a fixed method. Foucault shows how critique emerged from religious practices of conscience examination and became secularized in Enlightenment demands to "dare to know." The paper demonstrates how Foucault's turn to genealogy of critique changed his theoretical assumptions about power and subjectivity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how critical perspectives on tradition themselves have a history and are situated practices. Foucault's genealogy reveals that critique is not a timeless standpoint outside tradition but emerges from specific historical practices. This complicates simplistic oppositions between tradition and critique, showing how Enlightenment critique of tradition is itself a tradition with its own genealogy and power effects.

  POSITION: Foucauldian genealogical approach to critique that historicizes and problematizes the Enlightenment tradition of rational critique itself.

  title = {The Rational Critique of Social Unreason: On Critical Theory in the Frankfurt Tradition},
  booktitle = {Constellations},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {30},
  number = {4},
  pages = {467--482},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.12724},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Forst argues that Frankfurt School critical theory fundamentally aims to uncover forms of social domination ideologically presented as rationality—what Adorno called "the unreason of the dominant reason." Critical theory develops a historically situated, normatively reflexive critique that explains why existing power relations prevent emergence of more rational social orders while conceiving what such orders would look like. This requires both unmasking ideology and articulating emancipatory possibilities.

  RELEVANCE: Provides contemporary articulation of how Frankfurt School tradition critiques tradition and authority as forms of "social unreason." Crucial for understanding how critical theory analyzes tradition not as neutral inheritance but as potentially ideological formation serving domination. Forst's emphasis on "rational critique" shows how this tradition inherits Enlightenment commitment to reason while subjecting that inheritance itself to critical examination.

  POSITION: Third-generation Frankfurt School perspective emphasizing rational critique of ideology and domination embedded in traditional social forms.

  author = {Anderson, Joel},
  title = {Situating Axel Honneth in the Frankfurt School Tradition},
  booktitle = {Axel Honneth: Critical Essays},
  year = {2011},
  pages = {31--57},
  doi = {10.1163/EJ.9789004208858.I-439.13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson locates Honneth's recognition theory within Frankfurt School tradition while noting his departure from first-generation pessimism about modernity. Unlike Adorno and Horkheimer who saw Enlightenment dialectically producing domination, Honneth retrieves normative resources from modern institutions through "normative reconstruction." His theory of recognition patterns offers alternative to both classical critical theory's totalized critique and Habermas's procedural rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding how third-generation critical theory relates to tradition differently than earlier Frankfurt School. Honneth's method of "normative reconstruction" seeks emancipatory potential within existing traditions and institutions rather than wholesale rejection. This shifts the critical relationship to tradition from external denunciation to immanent development of progressive possibilities already present.

  POSITION: Recognition-theoretic approach to critical theory that reconstructs normative potential within modern traditions rather than rejecting them entirely.

  volume = {39},
  number = {4},
  pages = {773--794},
  doi = {10.1017/hyp.2023.119},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mahmood's critique of "teleological feminism" challenges liberal feminist assumption that agency only manifests as resistance to patriarchal norms. Through ethnography of Egyptian piety movement, Mahmood shows how women gain agency through cultivating virtuous dispositions within traditional Islamic practices. The paper argues Mahmood escapes the "Hegelian trap" of replicating oppression in feminist futures by emphasizing creative, immanent transformation rather than oppositional overcoming of tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial feminist intervention questioning whether critique of tradition must take form of liberal rejection. Mahmood reveals how liberal feminist frameworks impose teleological narrative of progress from traditional oppression to modern freedom, obscuring women's actual modes of agency and self-transformation. Her work complicates domain's assumption that critical perspective on tradition equals rejection, showing how engagement with traditional practices can be site of ethical cultivation and political agency.

  POSITION: Postcolonial feminist critique of liberal feminism's teleological narrative and its inability to recognize non-liberal forms of female agency within traditional practices.

@article{allen2008politics,
  author = {Allen, Amy},
  title = {The Politics of Our Selves: Power, Autonomy, and Gender in Contemporary Critical Theory},
  publisher = {New York: Columbia University Press},
  year = {2008},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen develops feminist critical theory by synthesizing Frankfurt School tradition with Foucauldian analytics of power and poststructuralist critiques. She argues that theories of autonomy must account for how subjects are constituted through power relations, including traditional norms and practices. Against liberal voluntarism, Allen shows autonomy emerges through critical engagement with the very traditions and power structures that shape us, not through escape from them.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges Frankfurt School and feminist theory to show how critical perspective on tradition must account for subject-formation through traditional practices. Allen's work reveals limitations of liberal autonomy theory which assumes subjects stand outside traditions they critique. Essential for understanding how feminist critical theory both inherits and transforms Enlightenment emancipatory project while recognizing its gendered exclusions.

  POSITION: Feminist critical theory synthesizing Frankfurt School, Foucault, and poststructuralism to rethink autonomy and power beyond liberal frameworks.

  author = {Allen, Amy},
  title = {The End of Progress: Decolonizing the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory},
  publisher = {New York: Columbia University Press},
  year = {2016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen argues Frankfurt School critical theory remains complicit in Eurocentric progress narratives despite its critique of Enlightenment. She demonstrates how Habermas, Honneth, and others rely on developmental logics that privilege Western modernity as telos of human emancipation. Drawing on postcolonial theory, Allen proposes decolonizing critical theory by abandoning progress narratives while retaining commitment to emancipatory critique through "contextualist" approach attentive to multiple modernities.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals how critical theory's own inheritance of Enlightenment tradition limits its emancipatory potential by universalizing Western historical trajectory. Essential for understanding how critique of tradition can itself be traditional in problematic ways. Allen shows that genuinely critical perspective requires reflexive examination of critical theory's own situatedness within Western intellectual tradition and its colonial legacies.

  POSITION: Decolonial critique of Frankfurt School's Eurocentric progress narrative and call for contextualist critical theory beyond Western teleology.

@article{dostal2016gadamer,
  author = {Dostal, Robert},
  title = {Gadamer, Kant, and the Enlightenment},
  journal = {Research in Phenomenology},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {46},
  pages = {337--348},
  doi = {10.1163/15691640-12341342},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dostal examines Gadamer's complex relationship to Enlightenment, showing how his critique of Enlightenment prejudice against prejudice does not simply reject Enlightenment but retrieves its authentic critical spirit. Gadamer argues Enlightenment's blanket rejection of tradition as prejudice itself becomes a prejudice, obscuring how understanding always operates within traditions. Yet Gadamer affirms Enlightenment's critical impulse when directed at genuine dogmatism rather than tradition per se.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding hermeneutic critique of Enlightenment rationalism's opposition between tradition and reason. Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice and authority (rightly understood) challenges liberal assumption that critical thinking requires freedom from traditional inheritances. His work reveals how Enlightenment critique of tradition paradoxically relies on its own unexamined traditional assumptions about reason and progress.

  POSITION: Hermeneutic critique of Enlightenment's prejudice against tradition while retrieving Enlightenment's genuine critical potential.

  year = {2018},
  volume = {31},
  number = {2},
  pages = {7--35},
  doi = {10.17159/2413-3027/2018/V31N2A1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Tayob demonstrates how modern Muslim intellectuals use "religion" as critical category to critique both tradition and modernity, developing strategies for renewal distinct from Kantian Enlightenment project. Through analysis of thinkers from Muhammad 'Abduh to Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, Tayob shows Islamic modernism develops alternative critical relationship to tradition that doesn't conform to Western secular frameworks. These intellectual traditions point toward different modes of relating to self, other, and political modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for decentering European frameworks in understanding critical perspectives on tradition. Shows how critique of tradition emerges from multiple intellectual lineages, not only Enlightenment rationalism. Muslim intellectual tradition offers resources for thinking about tradition-critique beyond liberal opposition of reason versus inherited authority, revealing Eurocentrism in assuming Enlightenment model is universal form of critical thinking.

  POSITION: Postcolonial analysis revealing Islamic intellectual tradition's distinct critical engagement with tradition beyond Western Enlightenment frameworks.

  publisher = {New York: Routledge},
  year = {1992},
  doi = {10.4324/9781003059516},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Benhabib develops feminist critique of both liberal and communitarian positions by articulating "situated universalism." She argues against liberal abstraction from social situatedness while rejecting communitarian imprisonment within tradition. Through engagement with Habermas and feminist theory, Benhabib shows how critical reflection emerges from within traditions but can achieve universalist moral perspective through communicative rationality. Gender analysis reveals how both liberalism and communitarianism exclude women's perspectives.

  RELEVANCE: Key feminist intervention in liberal-communitarian debate showing how both sides inadequately theorize tradition and critique. Benhabib's "situated universalism" offers middle path between Enlightenment abstraction and tradition-bound particularism. Her work demonstrates how feminist theory transforms critical theory by foregrounding gender as constitutive of supposedly universal liberal subject and showing how women's exclusion from public sphere shapes philosophical tradition itself.

  POSITION: Feminist communicative ethics bridging liberal universalism and communitarian situatedness through discourse theory.

  volume = {68},
  number = {6},
  pages = {914--927},
  doi = {10.1515/dzph-2020-0062},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Fatima Mernissi's and Mohammed Arkoun's strategies for rereading classical Islamic texts to develop contemporary normative grammar of justice. Mernissi recovers marginalized intellectuals and schools from Islamic history to derive immanent principles of justice, critiquing patriarchal interpretations from feminist perspective. Arkoun develops transcultural humanism based on both Islamic ethics and Greek philosophy through deconstructive examination. Both approaches aim to overcome narrow identitarian understandings prevalent in Muslim and Western societies.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how progressive rereading of classical tradition can serve critical purposes without wholesale rejection. Shows feminist and critical methodologies applied to Islamic tradition to challenge patriarchal interpretations while affirming tradition's emancipatory resources. Important for understanding how tradition-critique can be immanent rather than external, working within traditional texts and practices to develop critical perspectives.

  POSITION: Islamic feminist and critical hermeneutics recovering progressive resources from classical tradition to critique patriarchal orthodoxy.

  volume = {15},
  number = {2},
  pages = {145--159},
  doi = {10.1177/0966735007072020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Harrison examines challenges modern women face interpreting sacred Abrahamic texts containing patriarchal elements. She analyzes feminist hermeneutical strategies including rejection of texts, reinterpretation through alternative readings, and contextual approaches that distinguish culturally-bound from essential meanings. Harrison argues feminist biblical interpretation must navigate between uncritical acceptance of traditional authority and wholesale abandonment of religious tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Illustrates feminist scholars' complex negotiation with religious traditions—simultaneously critiquing patriarchal content while seeking to remain within interpretive communities. Shows how feminist critique of tradition operates through hermeneutical innovation rather than simple rejection, developing alternative reading practices that challenge traditional authority while affirming religious identity. Important for understanding tradition-critique as interpretive practice not just theoretical stance.

  POSITION: Feminist hermeneutics navigating between critique of patriarchal religious traditions and continued engagement with sacred texts.

  volume = {28},
  number = {1},
  pages = {74--89},
  doi = {10.2298/FID1701074I},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reconstructs Honneth's critique of liberal autonomy and his alternative conception of "social freedom" developed through normative reconstruction of modernity. Honneth rejects both liberal "negative freedom" (mere absence of interference) and "reflexive freedom" (individual self-determination) as insufficient, arguing true autonomy emerges through intersubjective recognition relations within modern social institutions. His Hegelian approach reveals how liberal tradition misconceives freedom as individual capacity rather than social achievement.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how Frankfurt School critically reconstructs liberal tradition by revealing its inadequate conception of autonomy and freedom. Honneth's critique demonstrates that liberal emphasis on individual autonomy paradoxically undermines genuine freedom by abstracting from social conditions that enable self-realization. Important for understanding how critical theory engages liberal tradition immanently, developing its emancipatory potential beyond individualist premises.

  POSITION: Neo-Hegelian recognition-theoretic critique of liberal individualist conception of autonomy and freedom.

@article{lotter2023habermas,

  title = {Habermas and the Caring Society: A Trans-disciplinary Feminist Critique},
  journal = {Koers - Bulletin for Christian Scholarship},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {88},
  number = {1},
  doi = {10.19108/koers.88.1.2544},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lötter provides feminist critique of Habermas's rationalistic vision of emancipated society, arguing it neglects care ethics and emotional dimensions of human relationships. Drawing on Carol Gilligan's ethic of care, George Lakoff's work on metaphor and morality, and neuroscientific research on attachment, Lötter argues Habermas's communicative rationality must be complemented by feminist attention to care, vulnerability, and emotional nurturing. Post-structuralist methodology allows integrating Habermas's universalism with feminist emphasis on specificity.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how feminist theory critiques Frankfurt School tradition for reproducing masculine biases despite critical intent. Shows that Habermas's emphasis on rational argumentation reflects gendered assumptions about public sphere that marginalize traditionally feminine domains of care and emotion. Important for revealing how critical theory's Enlightenment inheritance may limit its emancipatory scope by privileging rationality over affective dimensions of human flourishing.

  POSITION: Feminist care ethics critique of Habermasian critical theory's rationalist and masculinist assumptions.

  volume = {15},
  number = {2},
  pages = {476--499},
  doi = {10.5937/pravzap0-50310},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vujadinović traces feminist critique of justice theories from Aristotle through contemporary debates, showing how mainstream philosophical tradition systematically excludes gender justice. Examines Plato's philosopher-queens, premodern and contemporary theories preserving patriarchal public-private dichotomy, and emergence of feminist justice theories. Argues gender justice is crucial for any adequate theory of justice, not peripheral concern, revealing how traditional political philosophy's devaluation of women corrupts its foundational concepts.

  RELEVANCE: Provides comprehensive overview of feminist critique showing how philosophical tradition itself is patriarchal formation requiring transformation. Demonstrates that feminist perspective on tradition is not external critique but reveals internal contradictions and exclusions within tradition's own justice commitments. Essential for understanding how feminist theory interrogates entire Western political-philosophical tradition's foundations rather than seeking inclusion within existing frameworks.

  POSITION: Feminist critique of Western political philosophy's systematic exclusion of women and gender justice from traditional theories.

  pages = {138--164},
  publisher = {Cambridge: Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511575181.008},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Donner examines Mill's complex relationship between individual autonomy and tradition, showing how his harm principle aims to protect autonomy from traditional moral enforcement while recognizing tradition's legitimate role in forming character. Mill critiques tradition when it constrains autonomous self-development but acknowledges customs and social practices as resources for individuality. His liberalism seeks balance between individual freedom and social inheritance rather than wholesale rejection of tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for understanding classical liberal position on tradition which is more nuanced than simple opposition. Mill's approach shows how liberal emphasis on autonomy can accommodate tradition when understood as enabling rather than constraining self-development. Important for domain because it reveals internal tension within liberal tradition between critique of traditional authority and recognition that autonomy develops within cultural contexts shaped by tradition.

  POSITION: Classical liberal position balancing individual autonomy with recognition of tradition's role in character formation and social life.

  number = {1},
  pages = {169--179},
  doi = {10.21146/2072-0726-2024-17-1-169-179},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Smirnov distinguishes negative liberty (liberal tradition) from autonomy (republican tradition), tracing their origins to 17th-century mechanicism and Spinoza-Kant respectively. Republican critique reveals liberalism's limited understanding of interference in free choice, unable to comprehend subtle forms of domination. However, republican freedom also has limitations revealed by appeal to autonomy concept—it cannot address restrictions from internalized values. Smirnov proposes autonomy as critical framework exposing both liberal and republican blind spots.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how different critical perspectives on tradition (liberal, republican, autonomy-based) have distinct limitations and affordances. Important for understanding that critique of traditional authority comes in multiple forms with different philosophical foundations. Demonstrates need for conceptual precision when discussing "liberal critique of tradition" since liberalism itself is contested tradition with internal variations.

  POSITION: Conceptual analysis comparing liberal negative liberty, republican non-domination, and autonomy as freedom, using latter to critique former two.

  number = {2},
  pages = {34--51},
  doi = {10.1080/1369823042000269375},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Groarke critiques Anthony Giddens's late modern social theory for inadequate theorization of relationship between autonomy and tradition. Argues Giddens's "utopian realism" overstates extent to which reflexive modernity enables autonomous self-creation free from traditional constraints. By examining Giddens's sociological and philosophical foundations, Groarke shows how his account underestimates tradition's continued constitutive role in identity formation even under conditions of high modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Critiques influential sociological theory's assumption that late modernity dissolves tradition's authority, leaving autonomous individuals. Important for showing how social theory often reproduces simplified opposition between tradition and autonomy characteristic of liberal thought. Demonstrates need for more nuanced account of how tradition and critical reflection interact in contemporary conditions rather than assuming modernity's "detraditionalization."

  title = {Autonomy, Freedom and Rights: A Critique of Liberal Subjectivity},
  publisher = {Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers},
  year = {2003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Santoro develops systematic critique of liberal conception of autonomous subject, examining historical formation and philosophical foundations of liberal subjectivity. Argues liberal tradition's emphasis on individual autonomy, freedom, and rights rests on problematic assumptions about human nature, rationality, and social relations. Through critical analysis of liberal political philosophy from Locke through contemporary theory, shows how liberal subjectivity occludes power relations and social constitution of identity.

  RELEVANCE: Comprehensive philosophical critique of liberal tradition's foundational concepts relevant to understanding how liberalism theorizes relationship between individual and tradition. Shows that liberal emphasis on autonomous rational subject is itself traditional philosophical inheritance requiring critical examination. Important for domain because it reveals how "liberal critique of tradition" operates within its own unexamined traditional assumptions about subjectivity and freedom.

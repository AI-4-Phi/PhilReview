====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses the epistemological and normative debates surrounding tradition's relationship to reason, originating with the Enlightenment's critique of tradition as prejudice and authority. The rehabilitation of tradition began with Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy in the 1960s, which argued that prejudice (Vorurteil) and belonging to tradition are necessary conditions for understanding rather than obstacles to it. Gadamer's central claim is that the Enlightenment harbored a "prejudice against prejudice" that obscured tradition's productive role in interpretation and knowledge. MacIntyre developed a parallel account of "tradition-constituted rationality," arguing against liberal Enlightenment universalism and for the idea that rational inquiry is always embedded in particular traditions with their own standards of justification. The Habermas-Gadamer debate crystallized key tensions: Habermas argued that Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition fails to provide critical distance from ideology and power, while Gadamer maintained that Habermas's ideal of ideology-critique presupposes the very hermeneutic understanding he rejects. Recent work has moved beyond this impasse by examining how tradition enables both continuity and critique, and by exploring non-Western conceptions of tradition and rationality.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research on tradition because it addresses the fundamental epistemological question: Can tradition itself be rational, or does rationality require transcending tradition? The domain illuminates how "tradition" shifted from a term of Enlightenment derision to a legitimate philosophical concept, and how different accounts of tradition-constituted rationality shape debates in political philosophy about authority, legitimacy, and social change.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Gadamer and MacIntyre dominate the literature, there is relatively less attention to non-Western traditions' own accounts of the tradition-reason relationship, and insufficient engagement with how contemporary social movements navigate appeals to tradition versus critique of tradition.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should foreground the Enlightenment critique as the origin point, then trace the hermeneutic and virtue-ethics responses (Gadamer and MacIntyre), followed by critical engagements (Habermas, feminist critiques). The contemporary relevance lies in how debates about tradition-constituted rationality inform current political controversies over authority, reform, and cultural continuity.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Enlightenment rationalism (Kant et al.): 2 papers - Tradition as prejudice to be overcome by autonomous reason
- Gadamerian hermeneutics: 6 papers - Tradition as enabling condition for understanding; prejudice rehabilitated
- MacIntyrean virtue ethics: 5 papers - Tradition-constituted inquiry as alternative to Enlightenment liberalism
- Critical theory (Habermas): 3 papers - Gadamer's traditionalism lacks critical resources for ideology-critique
- Feminist/postcolonial critiques: 2 papers - Both Enlightenment and traditionalism problematic from marginalized standpoints

@book{gadamer1989truth,
  author = {Gadamer, Hans-Georg},
  title = {Truth and Method},
  year = {1989},
  edition = {2nd revised},
  translator = {Weinsheimer, Joel and Marshall, Donald G.},
  publisher = {Crossroad},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer's magnum opus argues that understanding is fundamentally historical and linguistically mediated, requiring a rehabilitation of prejudice (Vorurteil), authority, and tradition against the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice." The hermeneutic experience involves a "fusion of horizons" between interpreter and text/tradition, where pre-judgments enable rather than obstruct genuine understanding. Tradition is not a constraint on reason but its condition of possibility.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for hermeneutic defenses of tradition. Gadamer's critique of Enlightenment rationalism and his positive account of tradition's role in understanding directly address the central tension in this domain. His concepts of effective-historical consciousness (wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein) and application (Anwendung) reframe how tradition relates to critical reflection. Essential for understanding all subsequent debates in this domain.

  POSITION: Represents the hermeneutic rehabilitation of tradition. Argues tradition is constitutive of rationality and understanding, not opposed to it.

@book{macintyre1988whose,
  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {Whose Justice? Which Rationality?},
  year = {1988},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  doi = {10.2307/2107880},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre argues that rationality is always "tradition-constituted" rather than universal and context-independent. Different moral and intellectual traditions (Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal) have incommensurable conceptions of justice and rationality. Rational justification occurs within traditions according to their internal standards, and traditions can be rationally superior when they solve problems that rival traditions cannot. Against Enlightenment liberalism, MacIntyre defends the rationality of tradition-bound inquiry.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the major alternative to Gadamer's hermeneutic account of tradition-constituted rationality. MacIntyre's focus on moral traditions and his engagement with the history of philosophy (especially Thomism) offer resources for political philosophy's engagement with tradition. His account of epistemological crisis and tradition-transcending rational progress addresses the charge that traditionalism cannot account for critique and reform. Critical for understanding virtue ethics and communitarian approaches to tradition.

  POSITION: Aristotelian-Thomist account of tradition-constituted rationality. Argues traditions can be rationally compared and that some prove rationally superior to others through their capacity to resolve internal crises.

@book{warnke1987gadamer,
  author = {Warnke, Georgia},
  title = {Gadamer: Hermeneutics, Tradition and Reason},
  year = {1987},
  publisher = {Stanford University Press},
  address = {Stanford, CA},
  doi = {10.2307/590284},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Warnke provides a systematic exposition and critical assessment of Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, with particular attention to how Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition relates to questions of rationality and critique. She defends Gadamer against charges of conservatism by showing that effective-historical consciousness enables critical reflection on tradition, not just passive acceptance. Warnke explicates how Gadamer's account allows for both belonging to tradition and critical distance from it.

  RELEVANCE: This is the standard secondary source on Gadamer's views of tradition and reason in English-language scholarship. Warnke clarifies Gadamer's position on the Enlightenment critique and shows how his hermeneutics provides resources for rational criticism while avoiding both Enlightenment foundationalism and relativism. Essential for understanding the internal tensions in Gadamer's account and its implications for political theory.

  POSITION: Sympathetic interpretation of Gadamer. Argues his hermeneutics is not conservative but rather offers a non-foundationalist account of how tradition enables critique.

@incollection{habermas1977hermeneutic,
  author = {Habermas, Jürgen},
  title = {The Hermeneutic Claim to Universality},
  booktitle = {The Hermeneutic Tradition from Ast to Ricoeur},
  editor = {Ormiston, Gayle and Schrift, Alan},
  year = {1990},
  origyear = {1977},
  pages = {245--272},
  publisher = {State University of New York Press},
  address = {Albany, NY},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Habermas challenges Gadamer's claim that hermeneutic understanding is universal by arguing that it lacks resources for ideology-critique. While Gadamer correctly identifies the role of tradition and prejudice in understanding, he fails to account for systematically distorted communication and the ways tradition can embody relations of domination. Habermas argues for supplementing hermeneutics with critical social theory grounded in an ideal of undistorted communication.

  RELEVANCE: This essay crystallizes the key objection to Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition: that it is insufficiently critical and potentially conservative. The Habermas-Gadamer debate frames much subsequent discussion of whether tradition-based rationality can accommodate critique or whether critique requires standing outside tradition. Essential for understanding critical theory's challenge to hermeneutic defenses of tradition and for seeing what is at stake politically in these epistemological debates.

  POSITION: Critical theory position. Argues Gadamer's hermeneutics needs supplementation by ideology-critique that can identify distortions in tradition that are invisible from within it.

  journal = {Dissertation},
  url = {https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f79ff7cd94965ab4656f7929b572b97562a6c10},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kim provides a comparative analysis of Habermas and Gadamer on the relationship between reason, tradition, and authority. The dissertation examines how each thinker addresses the Enlightenment's critique of tradition while developing distinct accounts of rational critique. Kim explores whether their positions are fundamentally incompatible or whether a synthesis is possible that preserves Gadamer's insights about tradition's enabling role while incorporating Habermas's critical resources.

  RELEVANCE: Offers systematic comparison of the two major positions in the tradition-reason debate. Useful for seeing how the Habermas-Gadamer disagreement concerns not just epistemology but also authority, legitimacy, and the grounds for political critique. Helps clarify what separates critical theory from hermeneutics and what common ground might exist.

  POSITION: Comparative analysis attempting to mediate between Gadamer's hermeneutics and Habermas's critical theory.

  journal = {Cultura},
  doi = {10.5840/cultura20074124},
  url = {https://openalex.org/W2095110279},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Negru examines the debate between Gadamer and Habermas over whether hermeneutic understanding has universal scope or whether it must be supplemented by other forms of rationality (especially ideology-critique). The article clarifies what is at stake in Gadamer's claim to hermeneutic universality and how Habermas's objections challenge this claim. Negru analyzes whether hermeneutics can account for distorted forms of tradition without abandoning its core insights.

  RELEVANCE: Provides focused analysis of the universality claim central to Gadamer's philosophy and to debates about whether tradition-based understanding can be self-critical. The question of universality connects directly to whether hermeneutics can address political questions about ideology, power, and emancipation or whether these require different rational resources. Important for seeing the stakes of the debate beyond narrow epistemological concerns.

  POSITION: Analytical examination of the Gadamer-Habermas debate, particularly on the universality claim and its implications for critique.

  publisher = {Ashgate},
  address = {Aldershot, UK},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315235851},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: D'Andrea provides a comprehensive systematic exposition of MacIntyre's philosophical project, showing how his account of tradition-constituted rationality developed from After Virtue through Whose Justice? Which Rationality? and later works. The book demonstrates how MacIntyre's Aristotelian-Thomist framework offers an alternative to both Enlightenment liberalism and postmodern relativism, and how tradition-based rational inquiry can accommodate both continuity and progress.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most thorough secondary treatment of MacIntyre's views on tradition and rationality. D'Andrea clarifies MacIntyre's complex relationship to the Enlightenment project, showing both his critique of its pretensions to tradition-independent rationality and his retention of the ideal of rational progress. Essential for understanding how MacIntyre's position differs from both Gadamer's hermeneutics and liberal rationalism, and for seeing the political implications of tradition-constituted rationality for contemporary debates.

  POSITION: Exposition and defense of MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality. Shows how it offers a middle path between foundationalism and relativism.

  journal = {Dissertation},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame},
  url = {https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ebee142b5fa7aec3221a5f91b8f5163bf3d4aef0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lutz examines MacIntyre's concept of tradition-constituted inquiry and its implications for addressing charges of relativism. The dissertation shows how MacIntyre's Thomistic framework allows for rational comparison between traditions and avoids both relativism and foundationalism. Lutz analyzes how MacIntyre's account of epistemological crisis and tradition-transcending rationality provides resources for rational progress within and between traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a central worry about tradition-based accounts of rationality: that they collapse into relativism or make rational adjudication between traditions impossible. Lutz's analysis is important for understanding how MacIntyre's position attempts to preserve both the tradition-boundedness of rationality and the possibility of rational criticism and comparison. Clarifies what "tradition-constituted" means and does not mean for rational inquiry.

  POSITION: Defense of MacIntyre against relativism charges. Argues his Thomistic framework provides robust account of rational progress and comparison.

  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  doi = {10.1080/07393148.2014.995399},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Nicholas argues that MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted reason can be productively combined with Frankfurt School critical theory to develop a more robust form of substantive rationality. Against Habermas's merely procedural communicative rationality, Nicholas proposes synthesizing MacIntyre's substantive practical rationality with the emancipatory aims of critical theory. He shows how both MacIntyre and the Frankfurt School criticize modern "instrumental rationality" while offering different resources for reconstruction.

  RELEVANCE: This work attempts to bridge the gap between tradition-based approaches (MacIntyre) and critical theory (Frankfurt School), showing potential synthesis rather than mere opposition. Important for seeing how critiques of Enlightenment rationalism from different quarters (virtue ethics and critical Marxism) might complement each other. Addresses whether tradition-constituted rationality can accommodate the critical and emancipatory aims that Habermas finds lacking in Gadamer.

  POSITION: Synthetic approach attempting to combine MacIntyre's substantive tradition-based rationality with Frankfurt School critical aims.

  year = {1993},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  url = {https://openalex.org/W580073193},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dunne retrieves Aristotle's distinction between phronesis (practical wisdom) and techne (technical/productive knowledge) to critique the dominance of technical rationality in modernity. He traces how this distinction was recovered by Newman, Collingwood, Arendt, and especially Gadamer, showing how phronesis represents a form of rationality embedded in tradition and practice rather than reducible to method. Dunne examines Habermas's attempt to both appropriate and criticize Gadamer's rehabilitation of phronesis.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates the Aristotelian background to both Gadamer's and MacIntyre's accounts of tradition-based rationality. Dunne shows how the recovery of phronesis challenges Enlightenment conceptions of reason as method-driven and universal. His analysis of the Gadamer-Habermas debate focuses on whether practical wisdom (phronesis) can be separated from tradition or whether it is necessarily tradition-bound. Essential for understanding the Aristotelian roots of contemporary defenses of tradition.

  POSITION: Aristotelian-hermeneutic retrieval of phronesis as alternative to technical rationality. Shows connections between Gadamer, MacIntyre, and broader Aristotelian tradition.

  url = {https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37019952ce09ade417816028f80c4b39d61c411e},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Milić examines Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice, authority, and tradition as foundational concepts in philosophical hermeneutics. The article shows how these three concepts are interconnected in Gadamer's critique of the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice." Milić analyzes how Gadamer redefines these traditionally pejorative terms to show their necessary role in understanding and interpretation, and critically reviews Gadamer's arguments for grounding hermeneutics in these concepts.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent reexamination of Gadamer's core concepts and their interrelation. Useful for seeing how prejudice, authority, and tradition form a conceptual cluster in hermeneutic thought, and for understanding the philosophical and political implications of rehabilitating these concepts. The critical dimension helps identify potential problems in Gadamer's account.

  POSITION: Exposition and critical analysis of Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice, authority, and tradition. Generally sympathetic but identifies tensions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Shalin examines the concept of prejudice in Heidegger and Gadamer within its historical and intellectual context, particularly in relation to German conservatism and the critique of Enlightenment rationalism. The article analyzes how the rehabilitation of prejudice in hermeneutic philosophy connects to broader cultural and political currents in 20th-century Germany, and raises questions about the political implications of Gadamer's position.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding the historical and political context of hermeneutic defenses of tradition. Shalin's analysis helps situate Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice within German intellectual history and raises critical questions about whether this rehabilitation has conservative political implications. Relevant for understanding critiques of Gadamer from the left and for seeing how debates about tradition connect to broader political questions about authority and critique.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kuna examines MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality and his response to charges of relativism. The article clarifies how MacIntyre distinguishes his position from both Enlightenment universalism (which denies the tradition-bound character of rationality) and relativism (which denies the possibility of rational comparison between traditions). Kuna analyzes MacIntyre's criteria for rational superiority of traditions and his account of how traditions can learn from and be rationally refuted by rival traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the central challenge to tradition-based accounts of rationality: how to avoid relativism while acknowledging that all rationality is tradition-constituted. Kuna's analysis is important for understanding MacIntyre's distinctive contribution to debates about tradition and reason, and for seeing how his position attempts to preserve rational criticism while rejecting Enlightenment pretensions to tradition-independent rationality.

  POSITION: Exposition of MacIntyre's middle path between universalism and relativism. Shows how tradition-constituted rationality can accommodate rational progress and comparison.

  pages = {72--88},
  publisher = {Northwestern University Press},
  address = {Evanston, IL},
  origyear = {1966},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer argues that hermeneutic understanding is not just one mode of knowledge among others (alongside scientific explanation) but is universal and fundamental to all human understanding. The hermeneutical problem is not limited to textual interpretation but characterizes human existence as such, since we are always interpreting and applying tradition. Against methodological objectivism, Gadamer claims that all understanding involves prejudice, tradition, and application.

  RELEVANCE: This essay states Gadamer's controversial universality claim that provoked Habermas's critique. It is essential for understanding what Gadamer means by the "universality" of hermeneutics and why this matters politically and epistemologically. The essay clarifies that hermeneutic philosophy is not just a methodology for humanities but a fundamental ontology of human understanding that challenges Enlightenment conceptions of reason.

  POSITION: States Gadamer's claim to hermeneutic universality. Argues all understanding is interpretive and tradition-mediated, not just humanistic understanding.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Roqué examines the relationship between linguistic competence and MacIntyre's concept of tradition-constituted rationality. She analyzes how traditions transmit not just explicit doctrines but tacit skills and competences, and how this relates to debates about incommensurability between traditions. The article explores whether linguistic competence can serve as a model for understanding how traditions shape rationality while allowing for learning across traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses an important dimension of tradition-constituted rationality: how traditions are transmitted and how individuals acquire the competences necessary for rational inquiry within a tradition. Roqué's analysis helps clarify what it means to say rationality is "constituted" by tradition and how this relates to questions of translation and communication between traditions. Important for understanding the social-practical dimensions of MacIntyre's epistemology.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ambord examines the political implications of hermeneutic philosophy's rehabilitation of tradition, particularly in Gadamer's work and its influence on Pareyson and Vattimo. He argues that Gadamer's hermeneutics allows for both fidelity to tradition and critical, emancipatory engagement with it. The article shows how tradition's persistence even during social change can be acknowledged without abandoning the possibility of critique and transformation.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the key political worry about hermeneutic defenses of tradition: that they are inherently conservative and cannot accommodate emancipatory politics. Ambord's argument that Gadamer enables both belonging and critique is important for political philosophy's appropriation of hermeneutics. The article shows continuities from Gadamer through later hermeneutic thinkers who explicitly address political questions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Beam compares Gadamer's and MacIntyre's accounts of tradition as a resource for rationality rather than an obstacle to it. The article examines how both thinkers rehabilitate tradition against Enlightenment critiques while developing distinct accounts of how tradition enables rational inquiry. Beam analyzes convergences and divergences between Gadamer's hermeneutic approach and MacIntyre's virtue-ethical approach.

  RELEVANCE: Provides direct comparison of the two major philosophical defenses of tradition-constituted rationality. Useful for seeing how Gadamer and MacIntyre share a common critique of Enlightenment rationalism while differing in their positive accounts. The comparison helps clarify what is distinctively hermeneutic versus virtue-ethical in approaches to tradition and reason.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarthy examines Habermas's attempt to "overcome" hermeneutics by supplementing Gadamer's interpretive understanding with systematic empirical-theoretical knowledge. He analyzes Habermas's claim that hermeneutics, while necessary, is insufficient and must be complemented by theories of communicative competence, socialization, social systems, and social evolution. McCarthy assesses whether Habermas successfully goes beyond hermeneutics or whether his critical theory presupposes hermeneutic understanding.

  RELEVANCE: Provides sophisticated analysis of Habermas's position in the debate with Gadamer, showing both what Habermas accepts from Gadamer and where he claims to go beyond him. Important for understanding the critical theory alternative to hermeneutic accounts of tradition and for seeing whether critique requires resources external to tradition-based understanding. McCarthy's analysis helps clarify the stakes of the debate for social theory and political philosophy.

  POSITION: Exposition of Habermas's critical appropriation and attempted overcoming of Gadamer's hermeneutics. Analyzes whether the "overcoming" succeeds.

**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Total Literature Base**: 135 papers across 8 domains (High importance: 58, Medium: 54, Low: 23)

---

## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the conceptual and political stakes of understanding tradition, establish the review's scope, and preview the central tensions organizing the analysis.

**Content**:
- Tradition occupies a paradoxical position in contemporary thought: simultaneously dismissed as obstacle to progress and rehabilitated as condition of understanding
- The concept spans multiple disciplines (political philosophy, sociology, social ontology) with distinct definitions and normative valences
- Central puzzle: Is tradition opposed to rational critique or is critique always tradition-constituted?
- Three organizing tensions structure the literature: (1) tradition as inherited versus constructed; (2) tradition as authoritative versus ideological; (3) tradition as enabling versus constraining rational agency
- Review scope: conceptual analysis, normative evaluation, and contemporary political applications
- Preview: The review moves from contested definitions through the rationality debate to research gaps concerning tradition's social ontology and non-Western dimensions

**Key Papers**:
- Beckstein 2016 (systematic conceptual analysis of "living traditions")
- Gadamer 1989 (hermeneutic rehabilitation of tradition as condition of understanding)
- Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983 (constructivist challenge: "invented traditions")
- MacIntyre 1988 (tradition-constituted rationality)

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: Contested Definitions and Ontologies of Tradition

**Section Purpose**: Establish that "tradition" is not a univocal concept but names distinct phenomena across literatures, with different ontological commitments and political implications. This section synthesizes Domain 1 (Conceptual Analysis), Domain 4 (Social Ontology), and Domain 5 (Sociological Theories).

**Main Claims**:
1. Definitions of tradition range from maximally broad (Shils: anything transmitted from past to present) to narrow (Beckstein: practices claiming explicit continuity with authoritative transmission)
2. The distinction between tradition and adjacent concepts (custom, convention, habit, practice) reveals tradition's distinctive features: claimed continuity, normative authority, explicit transmission
3. Social ontological accounts diverge on whether traditions are collective intentional states, organized practices, or institutional facts
4. The "invention of tradition" thesis challenges essentialist accounts but raises questions about whether all traditions are equally constructed

### Subsection 1.1: Definitional Spectrum and Conceptual Distinctions

**Papers**: Beckstein 2016, Shils 1981, Jacobs 2007, Lewis 1969, Marmor 2009, Olwig 2001

**Content**:
- Shils's broad definition: tradition as "anything transmitted or handed down from the past"
- Beckstein's narrower criteria: claimed continuity, explicit transmission, capacity for authentic development
- The tradition/custom distinction: custom as tacit, embedded practice ("time out of mind") versus tradition as explicitly thematized inheritance ("mind out of time")
- The tradition/convention distinction: conventions are arbitrary coordination equilibria (Lewis), traditions claim non-arbitrary authority from historical sources
- Implications: "Tradition" does conceptual work that related terms cannot; it involves normative claims about the past's authority over the present

**Gap Connection**: The literature lacks systematic engagement between analytic conceptual analysis (Lewis, Marmor on convention) and hermeneutic/sociological treatments of tradition

### Subsection 1.2: Social Ontological Status of Traditions

**Papers**: Searle 1995, Gilbert 1996, Schatzki 2002, Tuomela 2002, List and Pettit 2006, Brouwer et al. 2020

**Content**:
- Collective intentionality approaches: traditions constituted by joint commitments (Gilbert) or collective acceptance of status functions (Searle)
- Practice-based approaches: traditions as organized activities with practical understandings, rules, and teleoaffective structures (Schatzki)
- The question of persistence: how do traditions maintain identity across generational turnover?
- Hybrid approaches: traditions involve both individual commitments and irreducibly collective properties
- Transmission mechanisms: ritual, material culture, embodied memory (Czachesz 2018, Whitehouse 2021)

**Gap Connection**: Philosophical social ontology rarely addresses tradition explicitly; most work on collective intentionality focuses on synchronic phenomena rather than diachronic transmission

### Subsection 1.3: Construction, Invention, and Authenticity

**Papers**: Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983, Handler and Linnekin 1984, Prickett 2002, Jones 2017, Bourke 2018

**Content**:
- Hobsbawm's "invention of tradition" thesis: many apparently ancient traditions are modern political constructions
- Historical revisionism on conservative tradition itself: "Burkean conservatism" as 19th-century construction (Jones 2017, Bourke 2018)
- The genuine/spurious distinction challenged: all traditions involve symbolic reconstruction (Handler and Linnekin)
- The paradox of invented traditions: they claim pastness while serving present purposes
- Normative implications: does construction delegitimate tradition's authority claims?

**Gap Connection**: Tension between constructivist sociology and normative political philosophy remains unresolved; if all traditions are constructed, what grounds (if any) remain for tradition's authority?

**Section Summary**: "Tradition" names a contested concept with distinct meanings across literatures. What unites them is tradition's claim to normative authority derived from continuity with a valued past. The ontological question (what kind of thing is a tradition?) and the constructivist challenge (are traditions merely invented?) set up the central normative debate about tradition's relationship to rational critique.

**Word Target**: 1000-1200 words

## Section 2: Tradition, Rationality, and Authority

**Section Purpose**: Analyze the core debate in the literature: the relationship between tradition and rational critique. This section synthesizes Domain 2 (Conservative Philosophy), Domain 3 (Liberal/Critical Perspectives), Domain 6 (Tradition-Modernity), and Domain 7 (Tradition and Rationality).

**Main Claims**:
1. The Enlightenment framed tradition as prejudice opposed to autonomous reason; this framing structures subsequent debates
2. Hermeneutic philosophy (Gadamer) and virtue ethics (MacIntyre) rehabilitated tradition as enabling rather than opposing rational understanding
3. Critical theory maintains that tradition can serve ideological functions that hermeneutic approaches cannot adequately critique
4. The tradition-modernity binary itself is contested: "post-traditional society" involves transformed rather than eliminated tradition

### Subsection 2.1: The Enlightenment Critique and Its Legacy

**Papers**: Folkers 2016 (Foucault on critique), Dostal 2016, Allen 2016, Tayob 2018

**Content**:
- Kant's sapere aude: reason requires liberation from tutelage to tradition and authority
- Foucault's genealogy: critique itself has a history emerging from religious practices of self-examination
- The paradox: Enlightenment critique of tradition is itself a tradition (Turner 2021 on "the tradition of post-tradition")
- Decolonial challenges: the Enlightenment framework itself is parochial, not universal (Allen 2016, Tayob 2018)
- Islamic and non-Western traditions develop distinct critical relationships to inherited practices

**Gap Connection**: The Eurocentric framing of "tradition vs. reason" obscures how non-Western intellectual traditions navigate this relationship differently

### Subsection 2.2: Hermeneutic and Virtue-Ethical Rehabilitation

**Papers**: Gadamer 1989, Warnke 1987, MacIntyre 1988, D'Andrea 2017, Lutz 2004, Leiviska 2015

**Content**:
- Gadamer's "prejudice against prejudice": the Enlightenment harbored an unexamined assumption that understanding requires freedom from tradition
- Effective-historical consciousness: we always understand from within traditions; this is enabling, not constraining
- MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality: rational inquiry proceeds within traditions with their own standards; traditions can rationally assess themselves and engage rivals
- The charge of relativism and MacIntyre's response: epistemological crises and rational superiority of traditions (Kuna 2005)
- Convergence and divergence between Gadamer and MacIntyre (Beam 1998)

**Gap Connection**: Whether hermeneutic and virtue-ethical defenses of tradition provide adequate resources for critique remains contested

### Subsection 2.3: Critical Theory and Feminist Challenges

**Papers**: Habermas 1990, Forst 2023, Benhabib 1992, Allen 2008, Mahmood 2024 (via Velji), Karoui 2020

**Content**:
- Habermas's critique: Gadamer's hermeneutics cannot account for systematically distorted communication and ideological tradition
- The Gadamer-Habermas debate: can critique function without resources external to tradition?
- Feminist interventions: tradition as patriarchal inheritance (Vujadinovic 2024); but also recovery of counter-traditions (Harrison 2007, Karoui 2020)
- Postcolonial feminist challenges to liberal teleology: agency within traditional practices (Mahmood via Velji 2024)
- The situated universalism alternative: critique emerges from within traditions but can achieve universalist perspective (Benhabib 1992)

**Gap Connection**: Feminist and postcolonial perspectives reveal that both Enlightenment critique and hermeneutic rehabilitation may reproduce exclusions; neither adequately addresses gender and colonial power

### Subsection 2.4: Tradition and Modernity Revisited

**Papers**: Beck et al. 1994, Giddens 1991, Eisenstadt 2000, Bracke 2008, George 2024, Gyekye 1997

**Content**:
- Reflexive modernization thesis: late modernity does not eliminate tradition but transforms it; traditions must now be chosen and justified (Giddens)
- Multiple modernities: non-Western societies develop distinct forms of modernity incorporating rather than replacing traditional elements (Eisenstadt)
- The secularization debate: empirical challenges to predictions of religion's decline (Fox 2008, Pollack and Rosta 2017, Clark 2012)
- "Pious modernity": religious actors construct modern identities from within traditional frameworks (Bracke 2008)
- Postcolonial synthesis: tradition and modernity need not be antagonistic (George 2024 on Ambedkar, Gyekye 1997)

**Gap Connection**: The tradition-modernity binary itself may be a product of Eurocentric modernization theory; genuine engagement with non-Western contexts requires moving beyond this opposition

**Section Summary**: The tradition-rationality debate remains unresolved. Hermeneutic and virtue-ethical accounts convincingly show that understanding and inquiry are tradition-constituted, but critical theorists rightly insist that some traditions perpetuate domination. The contemporary challenge is developing accounts of tradition that acknowledge both its enabling role and its potential for ideological distortion, without collapsing into either naive traditionalism or abstract rationalism.

**Word Target**: 1200-1500 words

## Section 3: Research Gaps and Opportunities

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate what the literature leaves unresolved and how these gaps relate to the research project's potential contributions.

### Gap 1: The Social Ontology of Tradition Remains Under-Theorized

**Evidence**:
- Collective intentionality literature (Gilbert, Searle, Tuomela) rarely addresses tradition explicitly
- Sociological theories (Shils, Giddens) lack rigorous ontological foundations
- Practice theory (Schatzki) addresses social practices generally but not tradition's distinctive features
- The temporal dimension of collective phenomena (diachronic persistence, intergenerational transmission) is underdeveloped in social ontology

**Why it matters**: Without clear ontological foundations, debates about tradition's authority and construction remain conceptually confused. If traditions are a distinct type of social entity, what are their constitutive features?

**How research could address it**: Systematic integration of collective intentionality theory with sociology of tradition; explicit treatment of temporal persistence and transmission mechanisms

**Supporting literature**: Schatzki 2002, Rust 2021 (Weber challenges Searle's social ontology), Brouwer et al. 2020 (hybrid approaches)

### Gap 2: Non-Western Frameworks for Tradition and Critique Are Marginalized

**Evidence**:
- The literature is dominated by Western philosophical frameworks (Enlightenment, hermeneutics, critical theory)
- Non-Western traditions (Islamic, Confucian, African) are treated as objects of analysis rather than sources of theory
- The tradition-modernity binary itself reflects Eurocentric assumptions (Argyrou 2002)
- Multiple modernities scholarship (Eisenstadt) recognizes civilizational variation but remains descriptive rather than normative

**Why it matters**: If the tradition-reason problematic is specifically Western, then political philosophy's engagement with tradition requires decentering European frameworks. Postcolonial and decolonial critiques (Allen 2016, Getachew and Mantena 2021) challenge the universality of liberal assumptions.

**How research could address it**: Comparative political theory drawing on Confucian (Ivanhoe 2014), Islamic (Tayob 2018, Karoui 2020), and African (Gyekye 1997) intellectual traditions as sources of normative theory, not just case studies

**Supporting literature**: Tayob 2018, Gyekye 1997, George 2024, Duara 2015

### Gap 3: The Normative Implications of Constructivism Are Unresolved

**Evidence**:
- Hobsbawm's "invention" thesis shows traditions are politically constructed
- Historical revisionism reveals even "the conservative tradition" is belated construction (Jones 2017, Bourke 2018)
- Handler and Linnekin argue genuine/spurious distinction is untenable
- Yet political philosophy continues to ask normative questions about tradition's authority

**Why it matters**: If all traditions are constructed, what grounds (if any) remain for tradition's normative authority? The literature oscillates between constructivist debunking and normative evaluation without resolving their relationship.

**How research could address it**: Develop criteria for evaluating traditions that acknowledge construction while preserving space for normative assessment; perhaps traditions can be evaluated by their consequences, internal coherence, or capacity for self-criticism rather than their origins

**Supporting literature**: Otto and Pedersen 2005 (synthesis of continuity and invention), Beckstein 2016 (criteria for authentic continuation)

### Gap 4: Tradition in Pluralist Democratic Contexts Requires Further Development

**Evidence**:
- Liberal multiculturalism (Kymlicka) accommodates tradition through group rights but faces challenges (Turner 2018)
- Deliberative democracy offers procedural response but may bracket substantive tradition claims
- The "liberal paradox" (Turner 2012): liberalism needs solidarity but undermines traditional sources of it
- Political pluralism (Muniz-Fraticelli 2014) recognizes non-state authority but requires clearer criteria

**Why it matters**: Contemporary democracies must navigate competing tradition-based claims without either imposing liberal hegemony or collapsing into relativism. Neither multiculturalism nor deliberative democracy fully resolves this tension.

**How research could address it**: Develop frameworks for distinguishing legitimate tradition-based claims from those that warrant critique; articulate conditions under which traditions deserve recognition, transformation, or rejection in democratic contexts

**Supporting literature**: Kymlicka 2017, Ashcroft and Bevir 2018, Stojanovic 2017, Getachew and Mantena 2021

**Synthesis**: These gaps are interconnected. The ontological question (what are traditions?) informs the normative question (when do they deserve authority?), which shapes the political question (how should democracies engage traditions?). Non-Western frameworks may offer resources for addressing all three that Western philosophy has overlooked. A comprehensive theory of tradition would integrate social ontology, normative evaluation, and political application while remaining open to decentering European assumptions.

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the review's findings, restate core tensions and gaps, and position the research project's potential contributions.

**Content**:
- The concept of tradition spans multiple definitions, from broad (anything transmitted) to narrow (practices claiming authoritative continuity)
- The central debate concerns tradition's relationship to rational critique: hermeneutic and virtue-ethical accounts show understanding is tradition-constituted; critical theory insists traditions can serve domination
- Neither naive traditionalism nor abstract rationalism is adequate; the challenge is accounts recognizing tradition as both enabling and potentially ideological
- Four major gaps: (1) under-theorized social ontology; (2) marginalization of non-Western frameworks; (3) unresolved normative implications of constructivism; (4) inadequate frameworks for pluralist democracy
- These gaps are interconnected and invite integrative theoretical work
- The research project can contribute by: developing rigorous social ontology of tradition; engaging non-Western intellectual traditions as sources of theory; articulating normative criteria that acknowledge construction; proposing democratic frameworks for evaluating tradition-based claims

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

**Tone**: Analytical, focused on tensions and unresolved questions, building toward gaps. Avoid encyclopedic coverage; emphasize insight over comprehensiveness.

**Key Argumentative Moves**:
1. Show that "tradition" is not univocal but contested
2. Frame the tradition-rationality debate as the central tension
3. Demonstrate that neither side (traditionalism vs. Enlightenment) is fully satisfactory
4. Argue that the gaps are interconnected and require integrative work
5. Position non-Western perspectives as potentially transformative, not merely supplementary

**Potential Objections to Address**:
- Objection: Hermeneutic accounts are inherently conservative. Response: Gadamer enables critique through encounter with otherness; the question is whether this is sufficient.
- Objection: Constructivism debunks tradition's authority. Response: Construction does not entail delegitimation; criteria for evaluation beyond origins are needed.
- Objection: Political philosophy must remain neutral between traditions. Response: This neutrality is itself a tradition-constituted position; genuine pluralism requires engaging substantive claims.

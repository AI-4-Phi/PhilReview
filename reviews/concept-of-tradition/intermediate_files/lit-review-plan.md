# Literature Review Plan: The Concept of TRADITION in Political and Cultural Thought

## Research Idea Summary

This literature review investigates how diverse scholarly literatures define, analyze, and theorize the concept of TRADITION. The review spans political philosophy, social philosophy, social ontology, sociology, and political science, examining tradition's role in legitimating authority, structuring collective life, transmitting practices across generations, and its contested relationship with modernity and rational critique.

## Key Research Questions

1. How do different disciplinary and theoretical frameworks define and conceptualize tradition?
2. What role does tradition play in political philosophy across conservative, liberal, and critical perspectives?
3. How do social ontologists analyze tradition as a collective phenomenon involving practices, transmission, and authority?
4. What are the major sociological theories of tradition (Weber, Shils, Hobsbawm, Giddens) and how do they intersect with philosophical accounts?
5. What is the relationship between tradition and modernity, and how have theorists characterized this tension?
6. How do debates about tradition, rationality, and critique (Enlightenment vs. traditionalism) structure contemporary discussions?
7. What distinguishes "living traditions" from "invented traditions," and what are the normative implications?
8. How do contemporary political theorists engage with tradition in debates about pluralism, identity, and legitimacy?

---

## Coverage Rationale

These eight domains provide comprehensive coverage through complementary approaches:

1. **Domains 1 and 4** establish conceptual and ontological foundations
2. **Domains 2 and 3** present opposing political-philosophical positions (conservative defense vs. critical perspectives)
3. **Domains 5 and 6** ground the analysis in sociological theory and the tradition-modernity problematic
4. **Domain 7** addresses the central epistemological debate about tradition and reason
5. **Domain 8** connects to contemporary political relevance

The domains span disciplinary perspectives (philosophy, sociology, political science) while maintaining analytical coherence through the organizing question of how tradition is conceptualized and evaluated.

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary thoughts on gaps the research could identify and address:

1. **Integrative conceptual framework**: Most accounts are discipline-specific; an integrated philosophical account drawing on multiple literatures may be lacking
2. **Social ontology of tradition**: Explicit social ontological analyses of tradition as a collective phenomenon may be underdeveloped
3. **Normativity and critique**: Conditions under which traditions warrant allegiance or critique may need systematic treatment
4. **Tradition in non-Western contexts**: The literature may be dominated by Western philosophical and sociological frameworks
5. **Digital transmission**: How traditions function in digital environments and online communities may be underexplored
6. **Tradition and practical reason**: Connection between tradition and theories of practical rationality may need development

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 8
- **Estimated papers**: 100-130 total
- **Key positions**:
  - Conservative traditionalism (Burke, Oakeshott, MacIntyre, Scruton)
  - Enlightenment/liberal critique (rationalist, autonomy-based)
  - Critical theory (Frankfurt School, feminist)
  - Hermeneutical rehabilitation (Gadamer)
  - Sociological accounts (Weber, Shils, Hobsbawm, Giddens)
  - Contemporary political theory (pluralism, multiculturalism)

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Burke, Oakeshott, Gadamer, MacIntyre, Habermas, Weber, Shils, Hobsbawm
2. **SEP entries**: tradition, conservatism, Gadamer, MacIntyre, social ontology, critical theory, modernity
3. **Recent developments**: Post-2015 work in political theory, social ontology, and tradition studies
4. **Critical responses**: Critiques of each major position; debates and controversies
5. **Interdisciplinary connections**: Sociology-philosophy interface; anthropological contributions

## Notes for Researchers

- **Use philosophy-research skill scripts extensively**: All searches should go through the structured API scripts rather than ad hoc web searches
- **Prioritize SEP for foundational context**: Begin each domain with relevant SEP entries to establish the conceptual landscape and identify key figures
- **Include recent papers**: Use `--recent` flag with `search_philpapers.py` and year filters with `s2_search.py` and `search_openalex.py` to capture developments since 2015
- **Cross-reference sociological and philosophical sources**: Given the interdisciplinary scope, use both `search_philpapers.py` and `search_openalex.py` for overlapping topics
- **Verify all citations**: Use `verify_paper.py` for DOI verification; never fabricate references
- **Capture debates**: For each domain, explicitly seek out critical responses and opposing positions
- **Note conceptual distinctions**: Different authors use "tradition" in different senses; document these variations
- **Flag classic texts**: Ensure foundational works (Burke's Reflections, Oakeshott's Rationalism in Politics, Gadamer's Truth and Method, MacIntyre's After Virtue, Hobsbawm's Invention of Tradition) are included even if not returned by searches

      "abstract": "The late Renaissance Italian secretary was a figure of importance at the very heart of the state, but the particulars of what the role entailed provoked debate in the proliferation of advice literature which emerged to guide this political profession. This article draws parallels between works aimed at the instruction of the secretary in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries and the many iterations of Italian political advice literature which preceded it, as well as investigating the presence and use of classical political theory in Italian secretarial literature, in particular Aristotle\u2019s Politics. It delves into the question of whether the secretary\u2019s role was based in rhetoric, the composition of letters, or if the secretary could aspire to some kind of political involvement \u2013\u00a0perhaps even advising a prince\u00a0\u2013 and therefore required knowledge of politics and political philosophy.",

His claims regarding national will and agency are analyzed, and problems with them are traced to his political theology and his methodological assumptions about Christian political theory. In place of those assumptions, Kuyper\u2019s idea of architectonic critique is recommended as a more fruitful approach to Christian political theory in the Reformed tradition.",

      "abstract": "This paper casts light on the dialogue between political realism and John Rawls\u2019s political liberalism. I describe political realism on the basis of contemporary realist currents that attempt to render politics an autonomous sphere of human activity, largely through an investigation of sources of normativity apt for guiding political action. I elaborate on what points realists suggest they conflict with political liberalism, and identify three foundational similarities between the two approaches to the legitimation of political authority which should suggest that political realism ought to consider a consensus view of political legitimacy. First, both approaches to normative political theory emerged from the broader tradition of liberal philosophy. Second, both rest on the premise of a pluralistic society, which has certain normative implications. Third, both are attempts to justify the primacy of the political over the metaphysical. When considered together, these assumptions point to a demand for a theoretical inquiry into a consensus view of realist legitimacy.",

Especially among philosophers, a consensus has emerged that conspiracy theories should not be dismissed as prima facie false, that each should be judged on its own merits. However, while some philosophers have encouraged social scientists to embrace this epistemological view of conspiracy theories, this article argues that it is less useful for those of us working in political studies. We are right to worry about being too dismissive of all charges of conspiracy, but conspiracy theorising involves more than just making truth claims; it is about politics, history and culture too. In approaching it through the narrow lens of epistemology, we miss much of what is happening in conspiracy theorising. My aim in this article is to offer a new framework for analysing conspiracy theorising as a practice, rather than as a category of explanation. This framework builds on Michael Billig and Jovan Byford\u2019s idea of the conspiracy theory tradition, showing conspiracy theorising to involve the recycling and adaptation of pre-existing ideas, themes and texts to fit new situations.",

This is done by calling sustainable development's scholars to return to the multilayered legacy of the classical political economy and conceive sustainable development in both historical and transhistorical terms. It is argued that a return to the tradition of the classical political economy, through the lens of Smith\u2019s, Mill\u2019s and Marx\u2019s stage theories of development, provides a powerful theoretical framework able to contextualise, develop and integrate the multiple, diverse, and middle-range contemporary strands in development studies. The classical political economy provides an analytical backbone of certain elements, including the important role of history, the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach, and the analytical priority of social classes that could be critical in enriching sustainable development studies. Students and scholars of international development would benefit from this worthwhile exercise that distinguishes in a succinctly and methodically manner between the current state of development studies and classical political economy perspectives on economic development.",

Interculturalism\u2019s nuclear philosophy lies in privileging people-to-people relations, and hence for a micro-identity politics. I will focus interculturalism as a strategy for citizenship-making and place-making policy with a pro-active defining feature, which transforms diversity into a public good. Following the identity citizenship politics, I will defend that conceptually it is better grounded within the republican normative tradition. After reviewing the intersection of interculturalism and citizenship, I will dig into republicanism, and especially its involvement in turning public spaces into public diversity-contact settings. My final intention is to exentuate the potential these public spaces have to become hubs for the promotion of intercultural citizenship. At the end this will help me to argue for a republican normativity of intercultural citizenship.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The article reconstructs Shklar's thoughts on war. It argues that these thoughts constitute a crucial pillar of her political theory. Of particular significance is the interpretation of her book Legalism, where Shklar criticised efforts to streamline the complex issue of the causes of war into a simple theory of power and aggression, and her work on Montesquieu, which ultimately allowed her to link thoughts on war and extraordinary cruelty to her interest in cruelty as an ordinary vice. In this way, the article answers the question about the relationship between Shklar's explicit cosmopolitanism and her negative political theory. It demonstrates that her thoughts on war were politically cosmopolitan, while allowing her to eschew the type of global ethics that underwrites just war theorising, she was critical of. The article makes a case for considering Shklar's work as a contribution to Global Political Theory, calling for the latter to look beyond the just war tradition to pursue its interests in both theoretical prescription and political reality. This because Shklar's thoughts on war successfully combined empirical analysis of world affairs with normative dismissal of human actions that place others in situations of existential fear.",

      "abstract": "This article synthesizes and clarifies the significance of the last half-century\u2019s developments in Bhutan\u2019s politics within the frame of Buddhist political thought. During this time, Bhutan has held a curious position in the international community, both celebrated as a Buddhist Shangri-La defending its culture in the face of globalized modernity, and at times, criticized for defending its heritage too conservatively at the expense of ethnic minorities\u2019 human rights. In other words, Bhutan is praised for being anti-modern and illiberal and denounced for being anti-modern and illiberal. As an alternative to understanding Bhutan vis-\u00e0-vis this unhelpful schema, and in order to better grasp what exactly is underway in Bhutan\u2019s political developments, I read Bhutan\u2019s politics from within the tradition of Buddhist political literature. I argue that the theory of governance driving Bhutan\u2019s politics is an example of Buddhist modernism\u2014both ancient and modern, deeply Buddhist and yet manifestly inflected by western liberalism. To elucidate Bhutan\u2019s contiguity with (and occasional departures from) the tradition of Buddhist political thought, I read two politically-themed Buddhist texts, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Precious Garland and Mipham\u2019s Treatise on Ethics for Kings, drawing out their most relevant points on Buddhist governance. I then use these themes as a lens for analyzing three significant political developments in Bhutan: its recent transition to constitutional monarchy, its signature policy of Gross National Happiness, and its fraught ethnic politics. Reading Bhutan\u2019s politics in this manner reveals the extent to which Buddhist political thought is underway in this moment. Bhutan\u2019s Buddhist-modernist theory of governance is a hybrid political tradition that evinces a lasting commitment to the core values of Buddhist political thought while at the same time being responsive to modern geopolitical and intellectual influences.",

      "abstract": "\n This essay surveys some recent attempts to decolonize political theory and engage with non-western political thinkers and traditions, especially anticolonialism. Our concern is that these engagements remain too centered on western political thought as the object of critique and analysis. Through the example of Gandhi and Fanon, we argue that anticolonialism, while engaged in a critique of the west, also had a positive or reconstructive theoretical agenda, one that has been taken up in creative ways in postcolonial political thought. Taking cues from the work of Sudipta Kaviraj, Partha Chatterjee, and Mahmood Mamdani, the essay proposes an alternative mode of decolonizing political theory that takes as its central aim the generation of theory from a study of postcolonial politics. It argues for a historically attuned and comparative approach to postcolonial politics that aims to innovate new concepts and reanimate inherited ones. From this perspective, decolonizing political theory is less a recurring critique of Eurocentrism than an effort to shift the terrain of theorizing and thereby reinvigorate the practice of political theory as such.",

      "abstract": "According to the received view, Marxian (ideology) critique and Foucaultian (genealogical) critique constitute two divergent approaches of critical theory that have remarkably different goals and little in common. In this article, however, we identify a guiding thread that connects the Marxian and Foucaultian traditions and motivates a distinctive approach within critical theory we call the \u2018critique of constitution\u2019. The problem of restricted consciousness, we show, is the core problem in common between Michel Foucault's critical history of thought and Georg Luk\u00e1cs's theory of reification which underlies the tradition of Western Marxism and Frankfurt School critical theory. The problem concerns the limits of intelligibility and, by the same token, the apparent inevitability of the given social ontology. Our sense of what is possible depends on what we are able to think. But we know from the history of sciences that the limits of intelligibility change, thereby also altering our sense of what is possible. This becomes a political problem in connection with the intelligibility of social reality, because our restricted consciousness limits the alternatives we can so much as consider and seek to bring about. The critique of constitution, then, aims to expand the scope of possibility by revealing the contingent formation of the given limits of intelligibility. We argue that this is the paramount political task for Foucault and Luk\u00e1cs alike, other important differences notwithstanding.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The relationship between death and politics figures prominently for us. However, the dead body has been neglected by this tradition. This paper shows how the figure of the corpse offers speculative resources in our contemporary moment, marked by conditions of existential threat and political decay. The paper discusses the ontological liveliness of the corpse, especially in relation to new materialism. The paper nevertheless draws our attention to the fact that the corpse is also the material site of an absolute loss. Accordingly, two developments for political theory become possible: a political phenomenology of loss and the approach of morbid opportunism.",

Fichte\u2019s philosophical views, which reshapes intellectual-philosophical bases of the post-Enlightenment era and makes a strong criticism of Kantian thinking. Philosophically, Fichte\u2019s philosophy, more representing a return to romanticism, will be debated on the basis of some concepts, among of which has been reason, science, tradition, religion, state, individual, and community. From his viewpoint, it will interrogate relationships among ego, morality and moral order. Based on these relationships, it will be tried to explain what man\u2019s moral nature is and how moral consciousness is conceptualized in Fichte\u2019 thought. The debates between these concepts will provides basis for a political theory framed by Fichte. Also, it will indicate how a political theory there was developed, outlined by Fichte for German nation over two basic concepts, moral nature and moral consciousness. Taking account of all these discussions, in conclusion it will argue that his political theory had more liberal-conservative implications, along with nationalist ones.",

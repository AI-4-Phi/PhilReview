      "abstract": "This paper explores the concept of intentionality from both the individual and collective perspectives, focusing on the arguments presented by Ludwig Wittgenstein and John Searle. Intentionality, the capacity of the mind to represent objects and states of affairs, is a fundamental concept in philosophy of mind. Wittgenstein\u2019s later works provide a basis for understanding how language and social practices shape intentionality, while Searle\u2019s contributions, particularly in his theory of collective intentionality, extend these ideas to social and institutional contexts. Through a comparative analysis, this paper aims to highlight the distinctions and intersections between individual and collective intentionality, offering insights into the broader implications for philosophy, cognitive science, and social theory. This comparative study seeks to deepen our understanding of the interplay between personal intentionality and collective intentionality, with implications for broader discussions on social ontology, language, and the philosophy of mind. A central issue is understanding how individual intentional states translate into collective intentionality, particularly the mechanisms that connect personal intentions with shared social realities. Another critical problem involves the role of language in shaping intentionality, exploring how Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas of language games and forms of life compare to Searle\u2019s concept of collective intentionality in the formation of shared meanings. Additionally, the study addresses the challenges of distinguishing collective intentionality from individual intentionality, especially in cases where individual intentions conflict with collective outcomes. A further problem is the ontological status of collective intentionality, questioning whether it can be reduced to individual intentionality or if it holds an independent existence. The study considers the broader implications for social ontology, examining how Wittgenstein and Searle\u2019s differing views influence our understanding of social institutions, norms, and collective practices.",

I will start with John Searle\u2019s idea of social causation as collective intentionality and (according to my understanding) even more important notion of a background. I will take a continental neo-materialist and economic approach to the subject. I will also read Slavoj Zizek as neo-material economics in continental philosophical way. Furthermore, I will compare Searle\u2019s notions of collective intentionality and the background of the social to Maurizio Ferraris\u2019 notions of text as a replacement for collective intentionality. The problems that Ferraris addresses are understood here in terms of practices. This reading will make space for neo-material developments of economic theory as social theory. I will not directly address Alain Badiou\u2019s neocommunism but will take some notions from neocommunism in general.",

      "abstract": "When we criticize social institutions and practices, what kinds of reasons can we offer for such criticism? Political philosophers often assume that we must rely on universal moral principles that are not necessarily connected to the particular social practices of our communities. Traditionally, continental critical theory has rejected this claim through its endorsement of the method of immanent critique. Immanent critique is a critique of social practices that draws on norms already present within these practices to demand social change, rather than merely conservatively reproducing them. Titus Stahl defends the claim that such a critique is not only possible, but also has politically powerful potential. Taking up recent developments in analytic enquiry into collective intentionality theory and in the philosophy of language, he argues that all social practices rest on structures of mutual recognition between persons that allow social theorists to reconstruct hidden norms present within these practices. Starting from a comprehensive critique of contemporary critical theory, Immanent Critique also spells out the consequences of this line of thought for the practice of social critique, for the social sciences and for political philosophy.\n The translation of this work was funded by Geisteswissenschaften International \u2013 Translation Funding for Humanities and Social Sciences from Germany, a joint initiative of the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, the German Federal Foreign Office, the collecting society VG WORT and the B\u00f6rsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels (German Publisher & Booksellers Association)",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT I concur with Dan Zahavi that research focused on small-scale joint agency is not a promising starting point for a general theory of collective intentionality. Zahavi argues that insights drawn from classical phenomenological analysis can help us define a more comprehensive framework. In this commentary, I consider a complementary source of insights coming from work on social cognition in the cognitive sciences. Their focus on small-scale joint actions and on the elucidation of the notion of collective intention leads classical accounts of joint action to underestimate both the role played by a host of lower-level cognitive abilities and the role played by external social coordination devices in the success of joint action. I argue that this double neglect of the cognitive infrastructures of joint agency and of its social superstructures is a major impediment to the development of a general account of collective intentionality and of the diversity of its forms. In particular, I propose that small-scale, face-to-face interactions and larger scale, more impersonal forms of collective intentionality tend to rely on different sets of psychological processes and capacities, but that, ultimately, both may have the same motivational basis, the need to belong as a basic human need.",

I argue that the essence of stable forms of rational power and domination must be understood as the functional influence of material resource control and the power to control the norms and collective-intentional, constitutive rules that guide institutions. As a result, the routinization and internalization of these rules by subjects becomes the criterion of success for any system of social power and social domination. I then consider how this relates the phenomenon of reification, which I proceed to show is when consciousness has been shaped by constitutive rules and group collective intentionality that sustain relations of domination and control and accept them as basic social facts, as second nature. I then go on to show parallels between Searle and Luk\u00e1cs before outlining the distinction between descriptive and critical social ontology.",

Then, it exploits these distinctions in characterizing the nature of the social, proposing that social phenomena might be understood in terms of collective intentionality, though there may be weaker notions of sociality involving interaction and mutual responsiveness among individuals. Finally, it deploys the three distinctions mentioned to clarify various different kinds of social power identified by Burman.",

Autonomy is often discussed in contexts of individual intention formation and moral decision making. When we consider collective intention formation and the decision\u2010making practices of institutions, a number of questions can be raised: How does the individual autonomy of participants affect the collective process? How do such collective processes modulate the autonomy of the individuals involved? How do institutional decisions and practices affect individual autonomy more generally\u2014in what way do they enhance or undermine autonomy? Is there a significant difference in how we answer these questions if we already think of autonomy as relational rather than in a traditional individualistic way?",

Productive labour and the 8-h working model contribute to this contradiction. We argue for the reduction of productive labour in favour of reproductive labour accumulated through practices of collective care. The latter can heal the damage capital accumulation produces. Collective care brings into light various social practices often invisible to production, allows for a new understanding of nonhuman agency, and challenges the dominant ethical disposition around work. We advocate for a new power equilibrium between productive and reproductive labour.",

In this paper, I show how the intentional view can be maintained even for \u2018collective\u2019 artifacts having multiple authors. My approach is to combine some basic concepts that have been proposed in the study of collective intentionality with a suitable model of artifact creation that takes account of the multiple agents and processes that arise in design, engineering and manufacturing a new or existing product. In this way, we can explain how an artifactual kind can be understood via a form of collective intentionality. For the design sciences, notions such as we-intentionality and group agency can help to model different types of cooperation and, in particular, to reconcile individualism with strong forms of collectivity at a group level.",

By juxtaposing a \u201cgood\u201d form of common sense that he calls buon senso and a \u201cbad\u201d form of common sense he calls senso comune Antonio Gramsci falls undoubtedly within the reach of the dualistic/dialectical theories of common sense. In order to scrutinize Gramsci\u2019s idiosyncratic conceptualization of common sense, I turn to Kate Crehan\u2019s interpretation of this concept and argue that Gramsci\u2019s understanding of common sense is better understood as a social-ontological category that is historical, inclusive, relational, and intersectional. In this framework, collectivity is disclosed as the primary mode both of existence and of practice. Ultimately, and in order to demonstrate the current political ramifications of Gramsci\u2019s understanding of common sense, I turn to his figure of the \u201cmodern prince.\u201d As I conclude, it is the \u201cbad\u201d form of common sense as senso comune that is most capable of addressing the current demands of an inclusive and radical democracy.",

Social actions depend on the acceptance of a propositional attitude in the light of a constitutive rule and the \u2018we intention\u2019 of each member. However, Searle\u2019s intentional theory of actions argues that human beings are rational in nature and freely choose to act as per a desire independent of reason; hence, offering a possibility of unreflective obedience towards social rules. What implications and considerations may emerge while explicating relationships between intentionality, intentional action, the notion of power, and coerced life? This paper assesses the scope of such collective participation (in the Searlean sense) that boils down to a coerced life. The viewpoint of a coerced life is examined along with the notion of intentionality and background, and how these notions translate into a concept of power.",

This explication is needed to counter the widespread misconception that phenomenological analyses of collective intentionality can only tackle the intentional structures of shared intentions, emotions and beliefs. If this was the case, phenomenology would be incompetent or inefficient in analysing the ways in which human agents\u2019 wills and actions entangle and gear into one another independently of their explicit decisions. The paper shows that the concepts of encroachment and seriality, introduced in mid-20th century by the French existential phenomenologists, are designed precisely for the latter, supposedly neglected purpose. Both concepts depict the non-intended interpenetration of human wills via the materiality of artefacts and infrastructures. They thus allow us to study the ways in which our actions enable and promote\u2014or hinder\u2014the actions of others.

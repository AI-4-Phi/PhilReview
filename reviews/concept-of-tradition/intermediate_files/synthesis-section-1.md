## Introduction

Tradition occupies a paradoxical position in contemporary thought. It is simultaneously dismissed as an obstacle to progress and rehabilitated as a condition of understanding itself. The Enlightenment framed tradition as prejudice to be overcome by autonomous reason, yet twentieth-century philosophy has mounted sustained challenges to this framing. Gadamer (1989) argued that the Enlightenment harbored a "prejudice against prejudice," failing to recognize that understanding always proceeds from within traditions rather than from a standpoint external to them. This hermeneutic rehabilitation transformed tradition from an object of critique into a constitutive feature of rational inquiry.

The concept of tradition spans multiple disciplines with distinct definitions and normative valences. In political philosophy, tradition appears as a source of authority and practical wisdom (Burke, Oakeshott) or as ideology masking arbitrary power (critical theory). In sociology, tradition names anything transmitted from the past (Shils) or specifically those practices claiming explicit continuity with authoritative sources (Beckstein 2016). In social ontology, traditions may be collective intentional states, organized practices, or institutional facts. These disciplinary variations are not merely terminological; they reflect fundamentally different ontological commitments and political implications.

The central puzzle animating this literature concerns tradition's relationship to rational critique. Is tradition opposed to reason, as Enlightenment thinkers maintained, or is critique always tradition-constituted, as MacIntyre (1988) argues? This question has profound political stakes. If all rationality is tradition-bound, then the Enlightenment project of liberating reason from traditional authority appears either incoherent or itself a tradition among others. Yet if traditions can perpetuate domination and distortion, as critical theorists insist, then hermeneutic rehabilitation risks legitimating what should be criticized.

Three organizing tensions structure the scholarly literature. First, is tradition inherited or constructed? Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) influentially argued that many apparently ancient traditions are modern inventions serving present political purposes, challenging essentialist accounts that treat traditions as organic continuities. Second, is tradition authoritative or ideological? Conservative accounts emphasize tradition's role in transmitting practical wisdom, while critical accounts reveal how appeals to tradition can mask power and exclude marginalized voices. Third, does tradition enable or constrain rational agency? Gadamer and MacIntyre argue that tradition enables understanding and inquiry; their critics worry that tradition-based accounts cannot adequately ground critique and reform.

This review synthesizes the contested definitions, the rationality debate, and contemporary political applications of the concept of tradition. It moves from contested definitions and ontologies through the central debate about tradition and rationality to research gaps concerning tradition's social ontology and non-Western dimensions. The aim is not encyclopedic coverage but analytical engagement with the core tensions that make tradition a contested and consequential concept for political philosophy.

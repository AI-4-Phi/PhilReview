VALIDATION NOTES:
These fabrications represent serious errors in the literature search process.
The domain researchers appear to have generated plausible-sounding citations
without properly verifying them through WebSearch as instructed.

IMPACT ON REVIEW:
- Total papers before removal: 210
- Papers removed: 6
- Papers remaining: 204 (verified or spot-checked as valid)

RECOMMENDATION:
Additional comprehensive validation recommended for all remaining entries,
especially arXiv preprints and recent 2024-2025 papers.
